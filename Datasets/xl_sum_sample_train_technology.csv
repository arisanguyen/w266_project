"UK watchdog Ofcom says users could save £150 a year on broadband alone once they are informed of alternative deals. Around 20 million customers are out of contract with their suppliers, leaving many paying more than they need to. The regulator says people can earn big monthly savings if they are told in advance of discounts on new deals. Matt Powell, editor at comparison site Broadband Genie, said the requirement for companies to warn when contracts are about to expire would help loyal customers remain on the best plans. ""Many broadband deals are sold with discounts for the initial contract term, and although these are often good value for the first 12 or 18 months, the cost after the discount ends can be substantially higher,"" he said. ""Regularly switching will let you take advantage of the latest offers and perhaps get you a faster connection. And if you don't want to switch, you should always negotiate with the provider at the end of your contract term to see if a better deal is available."" Some 25,000 broadband customers come out of contract daily, usually leading to an automatic price rise. Ofcom says the new rules, which come into force on 15 February, could help consumers save £150 or more on their annual bills. Service providers will need to text, email or write to their customers between 10 and 40 days before their contracts come to an end, giving details of:","Broadband, TV and phone customers will be given the chance to avoid hefty price hikes when their contracts end under rules taking effect on Saturday."
"Dave LeeNorth America technology reporter A survey of more than 6,000 hosts in five US cities concluded that names that sounded African-American were about 16% less likely to get a positive response to a request for a room when compared against white-sounding names like Brad or Kristen. In a statement, AirBnB admitted it faced ""significant challenges"" over the issue. It invited collaboration with ""anyone that can help us reduce potential discrimination in the Airbnb community"". It added: ""We are in touch with the authors of this study and we look forward to a continuing dialogue with them."" AirBnB is an online service which allows people to rent out rooms in their homes, or even entire properties. The site has has more than two million listings in more than 190 countries. Identical requests The study was carried out by a trio of Harvard Business School researchers. They noted that AirBnB's model of presenting lots of detail about both hosts and guests paved the way for discrimination. The five cities studied were Baltimore, Dallas, Los Angeles, St Louis, and Washington DC. Researchers made profiles that were identical other than the names used. Hosts were approached with requests to stay at the advertised properties. When profiles had white-sounding names like Todd and Allison, there was a 50% success rate for a positive response - ie they were offered the room. But with the black-sounding names - such as Darnell and Tamika - that figure dropped to 42%. The authors noted that the variation was consistent with ""contexts ranging from labour markets to online lending to classified ads to taxicabs"". The study suggested that black hosts were just as likely to discriminate against black people as white hosts were. There was no significant difference between the activity of male or female hosts. Researchers said the racial discrepancy did not exist in the hotel industry, as often bookings are made automatically and without the host seeing a guest's name beforehand - which is the proposed solution the authors suggest to AirBnB. ""[AirBnB] could conceal guest names, just as it already prevents transmission of email addresses and phone numbers so that guests and hosts cannot circumvent AirBnB's platform and its fees,"" the authors say. ""Communications on eBay's platform have long used pseudonyms and automatic salutations, so AirBnB could easily implement that approach."" They also suggested AirBnB encouraged more users to use its ""instant book"" option which allows guests to book rooms without the need for prior approval from the host. Subconscious AirBnB said instant booking was becoming increasingly popular, with one in five hosts using the feature - up from one in 12 in 2014. However the site said it was not planning to stop making users use real names to book rooms as they felt it was an important part of maintaining trust and confidence between hosts and guests. However Prof Ben Edelman, one of the study's authors, told the BBC he felt the real-name policy was excessive. ""They require you to reveal your name, but to what end? What good does that do? AirBnB says it increases accountability - but how does it? ""It's important that AirBnB know the person's name, but we don't think the prospective host needs to know the prospective guest's name."" The study authors conclude that while the internet can be a great leveller when it comes to race and social class, the same discriminations in the real world still exist, even if just subconsciously. The paper cites other studies showing subtle differences where race is a factor. In one study of sales on free listing site Craigslist, researchers found that buyers were less likely to respond to an advert selling an iPod if the accompanying picture showed the device being held by a black hand rather than white. Furthermore, a separate study by dating site OkCupid in 2014 revealed that even if users answered yes to questions asking if they were open to dating people of a different race, their actions in contacting matches and replying to approaches regularly contradicted that assertion. The explosion of social media was reversing early positives the web offered when it came to limiting discrimination, Prof Edelman said. ""If you buy something on Amazon, you're not going to get any racial discrimination, whereas you may have done in a physical store,"" he said. ""But the recent changes on the internet, having more pictures, more social connections, we've been making it worse.""

"In total, 25 separate operations were carried out across England, Scotland and Wales. Those arrested are suspected of being involved in a wide variety of cybercrimes including data theft, fraud and virus writing. One raid the BBC witnessed targeted a man suspected of involvement in a 2012 hack attack on web giant Yahoo. Stolen data The week-long series of operations was co-ordinated by the NCA's National Cyber Crime Unit (NCCU) as well as specialist officers from regional organised crime squads and the Metropolitan Police. West Midlands police arrested a 23-year-old man in Sutton Coldfield who is believed to have been involved in breaking into the network of the US defence department in June 2014. The biggest operation saw the arrest of 25 people in London and Essex suspected of using the net to steal money, launder cash and carry out other frauds. The hackers behind that attack stole contact information for about 800 people and data on the network's internal architecture was also pilfered. Eyewitness: Rory Cellan-Jones, Technology correspondent I was with one of the teams from the National Crime Agency as they carried out an arrest this week at a flat in north London. One group had tracked the suspect, a 21-year-old student, all the way back from university 40 minutes away. The arrest had some of the drama of a classic police operation - ""Go! Go! Go!"" came the command over the walkie-talkie as we approached the suspect's flat. But no doors were kicked in, and there were no shouts of ""You're nicked!"" The priority was to make sure any computers were seized before they could be shut down or their data encrypted. Teams arrived with equipment to gather data, and found a laptop and a desktop computer, both of them online. One officer was employed simply keeping her finger on the laptop's trackpad to make sure it didn't go to sleep. Later, police cyber-specialists would spend many hours examining exactly what was on the two computers. The action also resulted in the arrest of people thought to be part of some well-known hacking groups. In Leeds, a suspected member of the Lizard Squad group was arrested, and in London a 21-year-old man was taken into custody on suspicion of being part of the D33Ds Company hacking collective. The D33Ds group is believed to have been behind a 2012 attack on Yahoo that stole more than 400,000 email addresses and passwords subsequently published online. Phishing gangs Investigations about suspects in Sutton Coldfield, Leeds and Willesden were aided by forensic information provided by the FBI. The other actions targeted alleged phishing gangs, intellectual property thieves, users of financial malware, companies that offer hosting services to crime groups, and many people who took part in so-called DDoS [distributed denial of service] attacks in an attempt to knock websites offline. One 21-year-old man from County Durham allegedly knocked out the Police Scotland website mounting such a DDoS attack. ""Criminals need to realise that committing crime online will not render them anonymous to law enforcement,"" said Andy Archibald, deputy director of the NCCU. ""It's imperative that we continue to work with partners to pursue and disrupt the major crime groups targeting the UK."" In addition, this week the NCA coordinated visits to 70 firms to inform them about how vulnerable their servers were to attack and how they could be used by cyberthieves to send out spam or act as proxies for other attacks. The strike week also involved four forces setting up pop-up shops to give advice to the public about staying safe online and to get their devices checked to make sure they are free of malware and other digital threats.","The UK's National Crime Agency has arrested 56 suspected hackers as part of a ""strike week"" against cybercrime."
"The new project was provisionally titled 0x10c. It was to be a space-themed game, set in the distant future. Mojang, the company behind Minecraft, recorded £57m profit in 2012 and had promoted 0x10c during its development. Mr Persson blamed both the high levels of interest in 0x10c and code copiers for his decision to stop working on it. ""I was streaming code and someone copied all the code and made their own version of it,"" he said of the new game during a live web stream. ""That was kind of the start of the decline of 0x10c. I realised the community was more powerful than I had the energy for."" There had been a great deal of interest in the game, which was to feature an in-game computer which could be programmed and even infected with viruses by players - not least because of the success of Minecraft. Mr Persson has previously said he found it ""weird"" that he had made so much money out of the game, and told his web stream audience that he would no longer work on such high profile projects. ""I'm just going to make small games that hopefully you guys like instead of trying to do something that was going to have big mass appeal."" At the time of writing a blog documenting the development of 0x10c had not been updated since November 2012. Earlier on in the broadcast Mr Persson appeared to blame the excitement surrounding the game for its demise before completion. ""I stopped developing 0x10c because everyone started caring about it before it was even done,"" he said. ""I just want to make small games and talk to other game developers about them. Forget all the hype."" He has today tweeted about the impact of his reputation as a high profile game developer on his work. ""It was much easier to have grand plans when nobody knew who I was,"" he wrote. ""The gaming world doesn't need more under delivering visionaries.""","Developer Markus ""Notch"" Persson, who created the hit online video game Minecraft, says he has shelved plans for a follow-up."

"By Kevin CurranIEEE Technical Expert So, for all you out there with similar sensitivities planning to go and see Skyfall, the latest in the Bond franchise, be warned! I have been to see this movie (expect spoilers below) and if you like your technology on the realistic side then you should see a different show... One of the most glaring errors occurs in what is perhaps the most crucial scene between the cyber-terrorist bad guy Raoul Silva, played by Javier Bardem, and Bond, who is tied up throughout to a chair. In the scene, the large room is dominated by the racks of computers that allow Silva to conduct his cyber-attacks. What is striking to a geek like me however is the complete absence of background noise! Firstly, a room full of computing hardware would have to be air-conditioned to keep the temperature of the servers down. Despite the precarious situation Bond was in, all I could think about was the potential of a fire caused by overheating throughout this scene. Secondly, as anyone who has been in a server farm will tell you, you would have struggled to hear the conversation over the background humming from the machines themselves. Hacked-off Later we see an active hacking attempt on MI6 by Silva with Q and Bond watching an animation that represents the code involved in the attack. The animation is very creative but it has absolutely no resemblance to anything you might see in reality. What you would actually see would be a plain command line - very dull admittedly. If you were very lucky you might have a mirror image of the attacker's screen but clever graphics? Not likely. Again, we security geeks are asked to suspend our knowledge of the complexities of cryptography when we find Bond being able to decipher part of the code in order to spot Granborough Road Tube station embedded in the cipher. If only it was as easy as that. Code-breaking is incredibly difficult, just ask the poor people at GCHQ who only last week had to admit they were stumped by a 70-year-old message taped to the leg of a dead pigeon, and can really only be done nowadays by large amounts of computing power. I cannot remember the last time I broke even a simple substitution code, but admittedly I don't work for GCHQ. Tracking shots Then there is my particular bugbear - tracking Bond underground. The public have no idea how hard it is to even track people in indoor locations using radio frequency techniques such as wi-fi, Bluetooth or Zigbee. It is highly unreliable. However difficult normal above-ground indoor tracking can be, tracking people underground is a nightmare. Despite this, we see Q getting an immediate fix on Bond and easily tracking him as he navigates deep underneath London in the tunnels. Arrhhhh, I'm an indoor location determination researcher... get me out of here! Of course, it is not difficult to understand why films overreach in their depiction of technology. Take just one example from Skyfall, such as hacking. Hacking in the real world is quite mundane and involves a number of labour intensive steps from identifying the systems which have weaknesses to executing the ""payloads"" which allow capture of the remote systems. It also quite often takes place on an old-fashioned ""command line"" with no fancy graphics at all. Any movie which attempted to give you a realistic interpretation of this would risk putting the audience to sleep. Licence to school The positive aspect for us involved in teaching computer science is that exciting overdramatisation of technology can encourage the younger generation to take up computing courses in higher education. Even without the movie glamour however, life in computer sciences can be pretty exciting. One of the most involving aspects of my life is acting as an expert witness for defence lawyers in court cases. This often sees me forensically trawling through a defendant's hard disk or mobile phone in some corner of a police station, visiting suspects in prison and attending court in order to help with technical questions. This is indeed a fast-paced world to be in, and one about to get even more interesting in the near future due to the sheer amount of information stored on digital devices. The importance of this data and the need for secure systems is certainly one aspect of technology that Skyfall did get right - the James Bonds of the future will have to be very aware of the potential for disruption posed by hacking sensitive information and platforms. Kevin Curran is a technical expert for internet and security matters at the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), and is also a reader in computer science at the University of Ulster.","As a self-confessed technology geek, there have been numerous occasions when my enjoyment of a movie has been marred by technological impossibilities. For example, Independence Day was ruined for me when Jeff Goldblum used an Apple Mac to transfer a virus to the alien mothership and thus saved mankind, all at a time when it was a miracle if you could get your Mac to talk to a printer via a cable."
"By Katia MoskvitchTechnology reporter, BBC News The site has recently surpassed 10 million users, in record time . Copying it seems to be the latest cloning trend in China - a country known for copying the designs of everything from shoes and cars to iPads and tech start-ups. Tech blogs say there are about 20 Chinese clones of Pinterest already. Some copycats modify the original site's design only slightly, while others go a step further. Several have taken the basic idea of ""pinning"" and sharing theme-based photos a bit further, for example changing the interface to allow online shopping. In the long run, cloning websites could provide huge benefits to the Chinese economy, says Hamid Sirhan, a strategist at social media agency FreshNetworks in London. Cloning trend In China, locals joke that they have much more choice of products than in the Western world - and in a way, they do. Local markets offer anything and everything that looks like the original version, but often with subtle differences. ""Buying a copy is much cheaper, and although clones are all based on existing technologies and designs, often companies customise their product for the Chinese market,"" says Lu Yang, a Chinese BBC World Service journalist. ""For example, my grandmother has a mobile phone that looks just like one of the Nokia models - but it has much bigger buttons with huge digits so is easier for old people to use, and also has a SOS button for emergency calls."" And the online world is no stranger to cloning. For instance, in 2011 copycats of a social network Tumblr were popping up here and there, with one of the most popular clones being Diandian. Even a major Chinese Facebook clone, Renren, and China's microblogging site Sina Weibo, dubbed a hybrid of Facebook and Twitter, launched their own Tumblr-type blogs - Renren Stations and Qing. But in the second half of 2011, Pinterest clones started to emerge. 'Pin' and shop One of the most recent ones is Alibaba Group's social shopping platform Fa Xian. It was launched only four weeks ago in a test mode, but already has some 60,000 viewers a day. Just like Pinterest, it lets users ""pin"" images of items on virtual pinboards, where others can then post comments. But with a different twist, Fa Xian lets people shop, too - anything pinned on the platform is available for purchase through two Alibaba-operated websites, Taobao Mall and Taobao Marketplace. Besides Fa Xian, two other Pinterest clones have proved a huge success in China - Mogujie.com and Meilishuo.com. But instead of letting users ""pin"" images from anywhere on the web, they only offer content from China's biggest e-commerce site, Taobao.com. On Mogujie, visitors can buy items as well. Hamid Sirhan at FreshNetworks notes that ""while Pinterest has faced criticism for surreptitiously inserting paid-for content, Chinese entrepreneurs seem much more prepared to link some of these networks to commerce."" ""I am looking to these Chinese clones to provide the next key paradigms in social commerce."" 'Suppressing creativity' Just like sharing ""pinned"" Pinterest images on Facebook and Twitter, Chinese clones allow you to share on Sina Weibo and Tencent Weibo, another Twitter copycat. There are other Pinterest clones that, just like the original website, do not allow users to shop and open the entire web space for ""pinning"" images. They include Qihu 360's, Woxihuan.com, Huaban.com and iCaitu.com. But while clones of anything and everything in both the online and physical world continue to emerge in China, Ms Yang thinks that it would be nice if one day China would see its copycatting activities from a slightly different perspective. ""We are great at cloning, everyone knows that - and I think that copying foreign technology is a stepping stone for the modern Chinese,"" she says. ""It wouldn't be fair to say that we are incapable of creativity; perhaps we are a little behind in modern technology, yet we're catching up fast. ""I'm sure we will see original stuff coming out of China soon.""",Pinterest clones have flooded China's web world - only months after the social image-sharing website reached massive popularity.
"The servers were part of an experiment the BBC asked a security company to carry out to judge the scale and calibre of cyber-attacks that firms face every day. About 71 minutes after the servers were set up online they were visited by automated attack tools that scanned them for weaknesses they could exploit, found security firm Cybereason. Once the machines had been found by the bots, they were subjected to a ""constant"" assault by the attack tools. Thin skin The servers were accessible online for about 170 hours to form a cyber-attack sampling tool known as a honeypot, said Israel Barak, chief information security officer at Cybereason. The servers were given real, public IP addresses and other identifying information that announced their presence online. ""We set out to map the automatic attack activity,"" said Mr Barak. To make them even more realistic, he said, each one was also configured to superficially resemble a legitimate server. Each one could accept requests for webpages, file transfers and secure networking. ""They had no more depth than that,"" he said, meaning the servers were not capable of doing anything more than providing a very basic response to a query about these basic net services and protocols. ""There was no assumption that anyone was going to go in and probe it and even if they did, there's nothing there for them to find,"" he said. The servers' limited responses did not deter the automated attack tools, or bots, that many cyber-thieves use to find potential targets, he said. A wide variety of attack bots probed the servers seeking weaknesses that could be exploited had they been full-blown, production machines. Many of the code vulnerabilities and other loopholes they looked for had been known about for months or years, he said. However, added Mr Barak, many organisations struggled to keep servers up-to-date with the patches that would thwart these bots potentially giving attackers a way to get at the server. During the experiment: ""This was a very typical pattern for these automatic bots,"" said Mr Barak. ""They used similar techniques to those we've seen before. There's nothing particularly new."" As well as running a bank of servers for the BBC, Cybereason also sought to find out how quickly phishing gangs start to target new employees. It seeded 100 legitimate marketing email lists with spoof addresses and then waited to see what would turn up. After 21 hours, the first booby-trapped phishing email landed in the email inbox for the fake employees, said Mr Barak. It was followed by a steady trickle of messages that sought, in many different ways, to trick people into opening malicious attachments. About 15% of the emails contained a link to a compromised webpage that, if visited, would launch an attack that would compromise the visitor's PC. The other 85% of the phishing messages had malicious attachments. The account received booby-trapped Microsoft Office documents, Adobe PDFs and executable files. Brian Witten, senior director at Symantec research We use a lots of honeypots in a lot of different ways. The concept really scales to almost any kind of thing where you can create a believable fake or even a real version of something. You put it out and see who turns up to hit it or break it. There are honeypots, honey-nets, honey-tokens, honey anything. When a customer sees a threat that's hit hundreds of honeypots that's different to when they see one that no-one else has. That context in terms of attack is very useful. Some are thin but some have a lot more depth and are scaled very broadly. Sometimes you put up the equivalent of a fake shop-front to see who turns up to attack it. If you see an approach that you've never seen before then you might let that in and see what you can learn from it. The most sophisticated adversaries are often very targeted when they go after specific companies or individuals. Mr Barak said the techniques used by the bots were a good guide to what organisations should do to avoid falling victim. They should harden servers by patching, controls around admin access, check apps to make sure they are not harbouring well-known bugs and enforce strong passwords Deeper dive Criminals often have different targets in mind when seeking out vulnerable servers, he said. Some were keen to hijack user accounts and others sought to take over servers and use them for their own ends. Cyber-thieves would look through the logs compiled by attack bots to see if they have turned up any useful or lucrative targets. There had been times when a server compromised by a bot was passed on to another criminal gang because it was at a bank, government or other high-value target. ""They sell access to parts of their botnet and offer other attackers access to machines their bots are active on,"" he said. ""We have seen cases where a very typical bot infection turns into a manual operation."" In those cases, attackers would then use the foothold gained by the bots as a starting point for a more comprehensive attack. It's at that point, he said, hackers would take over and start to use other digital attack tools to penetrate further into a compromised organisation. He said: ""Once an adversary has got to a certain level in an organisation you have to ask what will they do next?"" In a bid to explore what happens in those situations, Cybereason is now planning to set up more servers and give these more depth to make them even more tempting targets. The idea is, he said, to get a close look at the techniques hackers use when they embark on a serious attack. ""We'll look for more sophisticated, manual operations,"" he said. ""We'll want to see the techniques they use and if there is any monetisation of the method.""","Cyber-criminals start attacking servers newly set up online about an hour after they are switched on, suggests research."
"Trident Media Guard is believed to have exposed a range of data, including advice on how to avoid detection. TMG monitors peer-to-peer networks as part of France's efforts to find those guilty of copyright infringements. Eric Walter, head of the French anti-piracy unit, confirmed on Twitter that it had ""temporarily suspended"" links with TMG. France's so-called HADOPI law has caused controversy since it was introduced in 2009. Suspected illegal file-sharers receive three official warnings, after which they are reported to a judge who can hand out a range of punishments, including disconnecting them from the internet. The UK is due to introduce similar legislation, although at this stage it has no plans to punish offenders with disconnection. But it will need to employ a firm similar to TMG. When anti-piracy firms monitor peer-to-peer networks for copyright infringements, they find IP addresses - the numerical code linked to a specific internet connection. Armed with this information, copyright holders can request that a judge forces ISPs to hand over the physical addresses associated with the IP address. ""Any firm that gets involved in this will need to make sure that its security is nailed down,"" said John Walker, professor at Nottingham Trent University's school of computing. ""This was the perfect storm waiting to happen. It was an instant target for hacktivists. You can't even call it a hack, it was a walk-in, a travesty,"" he said. A similar attack was perpetrated by hacktivists from the loose-knit Anonymous group against ACS Law, a firm pursuing alleged net pirates in the UK. In the process of rebuilding his website, the firm's sole solicitor Andrew Crossley exposed thousands of names and addresses plus lists of pornographic films that people were alleged to have downloaded without paying for. He was fined just £1,000 after he claimed bankruptcy, but the UK Information Commissioner said the breach was so severe it warranted a fine of £200,000.",A firm employed by the French government to track down net pirates has been hacked.
"The demand is part of an update to its policies that tries to make political adverts more ""transparent"". In addition, advertisers must reveal who has put up the cash for the advert. Social media firms have updated their policies in the wake of revelations that their ad platforms have been abused by Russian propaganda outfits. Google's new policy follow similar changes at Twitter and Facebook governing who can buy space for political adverts. Tight control In a blog announcing the change, Kent Walker, a Google senior vice-president, said the changes made good on a 2017 commitment to be more open about who funds political adverts. ""Advertisers will have to provide a government-issued ID and other key information,"" said Mr Walker. In addition, he said, Google would release a transparency report in the summer that only deals with election-based advertising. This would detail who bought ads and how much money they spent. It is also collecting political ads in a database that anyone will be able to search. Initially, the ID demands will only apply to US elections, but Google said it hoped to extend the more stringent controls to other votes and campaigning seasons. Both Facebook and Twitter have pledged to release more information about who buys political ads on their respective social networks. They also introduced tighter controls on who can buy ads. Those changes came in response to a series of reports which suggested that Russian actors with links to the Kremlin had been buying political adverts and targeting them at American voters. Facebook said the ads, of which there were about 3,000, did not support any particular candidate, but instead shared inflammatory information on sensitive topics such as immigration. In November 2018, US mid-term elections will be held which will see hundreds of US politicians up for re-election.",Google is demanding that those placing political ads during the forthcoming US elections must prove they are US citizens or permanent residents.
"A team of computer scientists looked at more than 72,000 chunks of code found on the Stack Overflow website. The site is popular with developers seeking advice on the best way to fix broken code. But researchers found many of the most copied snippets lacked basic checks that would stop common attacks. The dangerous code chunks often used obsolete functions, did little to check user responses and did not look for attempts to break the application, said the study. Security risks The researchers, also trawled through a website where many developers upload and share the code behind their apps and programmes. The most widely used insecure code blocks turned up in more than 2,800 separate projects on the Github website, they found. The research team, involving experts at Canadian and Iranian universities, focused on the C++ programming language, which is used in a huge variety of projects, from small programs to large distributed systems. The team informed those they found using the problematic code chunks on Github that they may have introduced security risks into their apps and programmes. The hard way But only 13% of the developers contacted said they had fixed the code, the researchers said. A similar number declined to fix the bugs. Some 40% said the code was safe because users could not change it once an app was running. ""The people who are using Stack Overflow, they shouldn't trust it fully,"" said Prof Ashkan Sami, a computer scientist at Shiraz University in Iran who co-wrote the study. ""It's better for programmers to do it the hard way and learn secure coding,"" he told The Register tech news site. Prof Sami said the team had developed an extension for the Chrome browser that checks when code is copied from Stack Overflow and lets coders know if it is poorly written or insecure.","Lazy developers who copy solutions to tricky programming problems are creating apps that are vulnerable to attack, research suggests."
"By Stephen EvansBBC News, Seoul That's the debate raging in South Korea at the moment. Because the government has ruled that people under 19 who buy a smartphone must install an app that monitors their web activity. Parents will be able to to see what their kids are up to online and block access to ""undesirable"" sites. Failure to install such an app means the phone won't work. Is it a triumph of good sense or a paternalistic government going too far, especially when you consider that many of these youngsters are old enough to vote in other countries or serve in the military? 'Harmful content' The government has developed its own monitoring app called Smart Sheriff, but there more than a dozen alternatives on the market. Phone stores now have posters at the entrance saying: ""Young smartphone users, you must install apps that block harmful content."" Apple loophole There is no opt-out. But there are loopholes, including the fact that the Communications Commission assumes that in the land of Samsung everybody prefers Android to Apple, so, according to the critics, those with iPhones can get round the rule. The government argument is simple but powerful: there is a pit of nastiness on the web and young people should be protected from it. The opponents' argument is also simple and powerful: it's about personal freedom. Children have to be allowed to roam in cyberspace - just like in physical space - to learn how to cope with life's difficulties, as well as enjoy life's pleasures. And even if parts of the internet should be closed off to children, it's for parents to decide where the barriers should be, not the government. Blocking access to a list of forbidden sites through a smartphone app is a step too far, they argue. Some of the apps monitor particular words and phrases, then alert parents when these triggers are put into search engines. Examples include ""threat"", ""run away from home"", ""pregnancy"", and ""crazy"". There are many, many more. Kim Kha Yeun, a lawyer at the Open Net Korea organisation, which is trying to get the compulsory instalment of the app blocked, said: ""It is the same as installing a surveillance camera on teenagers' smartphones."" Open Net Korea also fears that the list of banned sites could expand at the behest of politicians for political reasons. Smartphone rules There is a tradition of paternalism in Korea. South Korea was industrialised at the direction of the president, so it may be that what is tolerated in hi-tech Korea, where 8-out-of-10 teenagers own a smartphone, would not be tolerated elsewhere. There have already been attempts to control the way citizens use technology. For example, a default shutter-click sound has been introduced to smartphone cameras to discourage perverts from taking surreptitious, voyeuristic photos of people on trains, in changing rooms, or other public places. But the small number of convictions for such an offence would indicate that the truly determined are managing to switch off this sound effect anyway. In the shadow of dictatorship South Korea is a vibrant democracy. It's had free and fair elections since 1987. But paternalism doesn't have the bad name it might have in some other democracies. That is partly because the track record of strong government is good, in the eyes of many Koreans. The country was modernised rapidly under the firm leadership of a paternalistic president. Major-General Park Chung-hee took power in a coup in 1961. He was a strongman who utilised brutal methods - but he also dictated that industries be created. Under his direction, the South Korean economic phenomenon was born. Koreans know that. And the current president knows that. She should do - Park Geun-hye is the dictator's daughter. 'Nasty stuff' When the BBC talked to teenagers aged 18 and under, they resented being made to install Smart Sheriff or its alternatives. At Seoul Global High School, Won June-Lee, Yerim Jin and Minjun Kim were studying 1984 - the George Orwell novel in which Big Brother first appears - when the BBC visited. Their opinions all followed the same line: parents are right to have fears about what children are doing on the internet, but the kids are also entitled to challenge and negotiate what they are allowed to see. And learning to control what kinds of media are encountered on the net is now a part of growing up, they argued. Modern South Korea is struggling to come to terms with its past. It is a country seemingly addicted to technology, but also accepting of paternalistic government; a vibrant democracy built on economic foundations laid by a despot. Big Brother may have been tolerated in the past, but now he has to argue his case.",How much control should parents have over teenagers' web browsing?
"Sony Pictures Entertainment had labelled the video as being a trailer for the movie Khali the Killer. But its 90 minute duration acted as a giveaway that the upload contained more than just highlights from the film. The video was wiped after being online for more than six hours but not before news of its availability had spread. CBR.com - which seems to have been the first news site to report the discovery - described it as an ""epic mistake"". Members of the public also made fun of the find via social media. Sony has not responded to the BBC's request for comment. The low-budget film - which is about a Los Angeles-based hitman - had previously attracted little attention, despite having already been released in parts of Europe and playing at film festivals. That led some members of a Reddit discussion to question whether the ""accident"" was in fact a publicity stunt. ""It takes much longer to upload a feature-length film than a trailer. Presumably, someone would have asked why it's taking so long,"" wrote one. But this is not the first time Sony has made such a mistake. In 2014, the company posted a much higher-profile film - The Amazing Spider-Man 2 - to its South Korea YouTube account. In any case, Khali the Killer's director has been making light of the latest debacle, on his own social media feeds.",Thousands of people watched a film posted in its entirety to YouTube by its US distributor before the apparent mistake was tackled.
"By Chris BaraniukTechnology reporter The computer, about the same size as a credit card, was first released in 2012 and is widely used as an educational tool for programming. However, it can also be used for many practical purposes such as streaming music to several devices in a house. A new starter kit for Raspberry Pi, including a keyboard and mouse, has been released to celebrate the success. The kit also includes an SD storage card, official case, power supply, HDMI cable, mouse, keyboard and guidebook - it costs £99 plus VAT and will be available in the coming weeks. The Pi, which is manufactured in Wales, has been adopted by pupils, programmers and inventors around the world. Many have received versions for free via the Raspberry Pi Foundation, a charity. British astronaut Tim Peake even took two to the International Space Station. ""We thought our lifetime volumes might amount to 10,000 units - if we were lucky,"" wrote founder Eben Upton in a blog. ""There was no expectation that adults would use Raspberry Pi, no expectation of commercial success and certainly no expectation that four years later we would be manufacturing tens of thousands of units a day in the UK and exporting Raspberry Pi all over the world."" The latest sales figures were ""fantastic"", said tech industry analyst Chris Green - who owns four of the computers himself - at business consultancy Lewis. ""It's more than just a geeky coding tool - it's increasingly proving itself as a useful computer,"" he told the BBC. The Raspberry Pi Zero, a version of the computer that costs £4, was ideal for use in developing countries, he added. ""They can run off batteries so where there isn't an abundance of electricity you still have a computer that can be used for teaching."" 'Hard to use' Although the Raspberry Pi has been used in many schools, it was more complicated for children to get to grips with than the BBC Micro Bit, argued Bethany Koby, co-founder of education-focused start-up Technology Will Save Us, which helped design the BBC's device. ""[The Raspberry Pis are] incredibly powerful but they're hard to use,"" she told the BBC. ""That being said, the resources are amazing."" One million BBC Micro Bit computers were delivered free to every Year Seven student in England and Wales earlier this year.",The Raspberry Pi has sold 10 million units - continuing its success as the most popular British computer ever.
"By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter His words add to a growing debate among health workers, governments and lobby groups about whether gaming can be harmful to health. The remarks come just before the Gaming Bafta Awards, one of the biggest nights in the UK's gaming calendar, which take place in London on Thursday evening. But is he right? What did Prince Harry say? At an event at a YMCA in west London, the Duke of Sussex launched a scathing attack on social media and gaming. Of Fortnite, he said: ""That game shouldn't be allowed. Where is the benefit of having it in your household? ""It's created to addict, an addiction to keep you in front of a computer for as long as possible. It's so irresponsible. ""It's like waiting for the damage to be done and kids turning up on your doorsteps and families being broken down."" He added that social media was ""more addictive than alcohol and drugs"". What is Fortnite? The game has become a global phenomenon and the aim is simple - survive for as long as possible. Each match has a total of 99 other players with the same goals and lasts around 20 minutes, depending on how successful you are. It has 200 million registered players worldwide and is free to download, but players can spend money on in-game purchases. Players can play alone, as part of a four-person squad or a 20-member team, either with friends or people they do not know. What do doctors think? Earlier this month, a GP told an 11-year-old boy that he was ""prescribing"" a two-week ban from computer games such as Fortnite and Minecraft. Dr Amir Khan said that he was concerned about the impact gaming was having on the boy's life. It was a light-hearted attempt to draw attention to a serious issue but, anecdotally, more doctors are seeing links between gaming and effects on both the physical and mental health of young people. And it is not only youngsters who are affected. Research shows that 200 divorces in the UK from January to September 2018 mentioned addiction to Fortnite and other online games as one of the reasons for relationship breakdown. However, Scottish university researcher Andrew Reid said he thought that the game was not ""addictive"" and suggested that using the term could stigmatise regular video game players. He added that some research showed ""positive characteristics of play"". What do the gamers say about addiction? There are plenty of gamers who play for long periods of time and say it has no impact on their wider social lives or health. But some have had enough. Matus Mikus joined Game Quitters, an online forum made up of thousands of people who have turned their backs on games, after his relationship broke down because he was spending too much time gaming. James Good is a self-confessed gaming addict, once spending 32 hours playing without a break. The problem led to him falling behind at university. ""My grades were slipping as a result of playing too many games. I didn't eat, sleep or leave my room. I escaped my problems via games,"" he recently told a group of MPs. And he said the effect of playing was triggering physical responses. ""Games fire up response systems in your brain and other things don't bring you as much joy,"" he told the MPs. ""I was thinking, 'Why would I spend time with my friends when I can play video games?'. ""It felt good to get points, trophies, beat people. It fuelled my competitiveness - but I realised I wasn't truly happy."" James admits he became depressed, but stopped short of saying that gaming was the root cause. He added that gaming as a teenager was not a problem, because he combined it with an active life, playing sports and going to Scouts, and his parents helped him manage his time. Being without parental guidance at university appears to be the trigger that turned his gaming from a much-loved activity to an obsession. He too turned to Game Quitters and admits to having withdrawal symptoms when he followed its challenge for new members to give up gaming for 90 days. ""I was getting headaches, moods and I had to lock my computer in a cupboard,"" he said. What's the view of the games firms? The BBC has asked Epic Games, the makers of Fortnite, for comment but has not yet had a response. Gaming is booming and the UK games industry is worth a record £5.7bn, in part thanks to Fortnite, according to new figures from gaming trades body Ukie, which said that there was ""little evidence"" gaming causes harm to health. Dr Jo Twist, Ukie's chief executive and chairwoman of Bafta Games, said: ""We care about players. ""We want to help parents and carers who don't play games themselves to feel better equipped and knowledgeable about safe and responsible game play, and the positive impact games can have on people's lives."" She added that game age ratings ""should be taken seriously"" and that parents and carers should use online resources to ensure their children played in a responsible way. Ukie points to research conducted by Prof Andrew Przybylski, an experimental psychologist at the Oxford Internet Institute, who has said that only 0.3% of gamers might experience problems controlling the time they spend playing video games. He told the BBC: Large scale research studies on the topic indicate that games may not be inherently addictive and should best be thought of as a coping mechanism for, rather than cause of, mental distress. Placing undue blame on games risks stigmatising a popular hobby regularly pursued by nearly two billion people."" The World Health Organization disagrees and last year recognised excessive gaming as a mental health disorder. Does gaming need greater government scrutiny? The Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee is currently interviewing gamers, games firms and other experts as part of its ongoing inquiry into technology addiction. It is due to report back on its findings later this year. Chairman Damian Collins told the BBC ahead of that: ""We have invited Epic Games, the company behind Fortnite, to give evidence to our investigation, which is examining the addictive nature of gaming, as well as links between gaming and gambling. ""We hope that Epic will accept our invitation. We will certainly raise with them the significant concerns that Prince Harry has expressed about Fortnite, and how they respond to his call for it to be banned."" And it is not just the UK that is looking into the links between gaming and the health of youngsters. China, the world's largest gaming market, is increasingly concerned about addiction and the impact of gaming on children's eyesight, and has taken strong measures to crack down on the issue. China's tech giant Tencent has tightened checks on the age of people playing online games - checking identities and ages against a police database. Children under 12 are only able to play for an hour a day. Older children can play for up to two hours, but not during a night-time curfew.","Prince Harry has called for a ban on Fortnite, saying the survival game beloved by teenagers around the world, was ""created to addict""."
"Microsoft said the vulnerability was so severe that it needed to release a patch outside its usual monthly security update. Security researchers from Google were among the experts who helped uncover the loophole. The vulnerability was found in the parts of Windows that let the software handle some types of fonts. If exploited, the bug would let attackers take over a target machine and run their own software on it. In its advisory note about the vulnerability, Microsoft said the bug was being talked about online but had no information ""to indicate this vulnerability had been used to attack customers"". However, it said, its own research had shown that attackers exploiting it could ""take complete control"" of a vulnerable system. Windows users could fall victim to attackers who booby-trapped websites with exploit code or were tricked into opening a malicious email attachment. The vulnerability has been found in Windows 7, 8 and RT as well as older versions such as Vista, Server 2008 and Server 2012. Microsoft said it was tipped off about the bug by security researchers from security companies FireEye and Trend Micro as well as experts from Google's Project Zero that seeks out unknown loopholes in code. The patch comes less than a week after Microsoft closed another loophole in the same font-handling system. That separate hole came to light following a hack attack on a security company called the Hacking Team. The attack involved the theft of hundreds of megabytes of documents that, among other things, exposed software bugs it had been planning to exploit for its own ends.","Microsoft has released an emergency patch for a ""critical"" bug present on almost every version of Windows."
"The PS3Jailbreak ""dongle"" allows gamers to play homemade and pirated games on the game's console. The ban prevents OzModChips, Mod Supplier and Quantronics from importing, distributing or selling the device. Sony has until August 31 to makes its case to the court for a permanent ban. If it fails, the chips could go on sale on 1 September. The firm declined to comment on the proceedings. The Australian distributors could not be reached. The court order also gives Sony control of all of the dongles in the firms' possession and allows the electronics giant to test the devices - including ""destructive analysis"" - to see how they work. Homebrew games PS3Jailbreak is a dongle containing software that allows users to save games to the console's hard drive. It is the first product to crack the security on the PS3. It was met with scepticism when videos of the device - posted by OzModChips - first appeared online in early August. At the time, a spokesperson for Console Pro, another distributor based in the Netherlands, told BBC News the ""dongle converts a retail unit into a dev unit"". Dev units are used by developers to test code for the machine. ""Dev mode means it will run any - even unsigned - code,"" said the spokesperson. ""Using a simple backup maker or player software, you can play backed-up [saved] games without the actual disc being in the PS3."" The legality of these products - commonly called modchips - differs by country. In Australia they are legal, whilst in the UK a recent court case brought by Nintendo said that ""game copiers"" were illegal to import, advertise or sell. Proponents of modchips say they are the only way to play homemade games, known as ""homebrews"". It is not known whether distributors in other countries have been served similar notices. But, a spokesperson for Console Pro told BBC News in the wake of Friday's ban that the firm had ""not heard anything from Sony or any lawyer or court yet"". ""I really doubt Sony has grounds to ban this dongle.""",Sony has won a temporary ban to prevent Australian distributors selling a hardware hack for the PlayStation 3 (PS3).
"The Open Rights Group and other organisations are concerned that the consultation is being rushed through with minimum publicity. They want to see strong laws to protect citizens who have had their e-mail or web traffic collected without consent. The consultation has been forced on the UK by the European Commission. Initially the Home Office said a meeting with civil society groups was unnecessary but it has u-turned on that and will meet ORG and others early this week. It has also extended the consultation deadline until 17 December. The consultation on possible changes to the UK's data laws follows an EC investigation into how Phorm, a controversial ad-tracking technology, was rolled out in the UK. As part of that investigation, the EC found that the UK currently has no legal redress for citizens who think that their web browsing or e-mail has been monitored unintentionally. Neither does it have any official body to deal with such complaints. This puts the UK in breach of the European e-Privacy directive and has forced the Home Office to reconsider its Ripa (the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act) legislation. Any change to Ripa could have implications for firms which have intercepted data without permission, such as Google, which accidentally collected huge amounts of private data on unsecured wi-fi networks when it was gathering information for its Street View service. It could also provide redress for the thousands of BT customers who took part in Phorm trials without giving their consent. Phorm is one of a growing number of firms which wants to track web behaviour in order to better target advertisements. BT was among a handful of UK ISPs to sign up to the scheme and initially carried out a series of trials without telling customers they were taking part. Directly affected The Home Office consultation opened in November. Jim Killock, chief executive of the Open Rights Group, is not happy about the way the consultation is being conducted. ""When the consultation started in November we heard about it through the grapevine rather than a public announcement,"" he said. ""We wrote to the Home Office saying they needed to meet with representatives from civil society because the law was about individual rights,"" ""We were told that the Home Office was only consulting those directly affected, ie those who might get punished, ignoring the fact that those most directly affected are the general public,"" he said. ""The consultation is about a very serious matter. What rights should we have as citizens to take legal action against people who intercept our communications? Should criminal as well as civil charges be available? Who should investigate?"" he added. The Home Office wants to extend the powers of the Interception Commissioner, who currently deals with citizens who feel they have been put under unnecessary surveillance via government agencies, to include complaints against private sector companies. It is proposing that the Interception Commissioner should be given the power to issue fines against firms such as BT, if individuals complain that their web communications have been intercepted unintentionally. ""It is talking about fines of around £10,000 which is pocket money to firms such as BT. It is a joke,"" said Mr Killock. He is not convinced giving more powers to the Interception Commissioner would be the best way to tighten data privacy laws. ""The Interception Commissioner has no history of relations with the private sector and no technical expertise. We would prefer it that there would be the option, for instance, that the police be able to investigate. A one stop shop for privacy complaints should also be considered,"" he said. ""The worry is that the Home Office will do the absolute minimum to bring the UK in line with Europe and we will end up with very weak powers,"" he added. Since the post of Interception Commissioner was created in 1986, it has upheld just four complaints, according to Mr Killock. The Home Office told the BBC: ""The consultation is available on the Home Office website for anyone to view. We welcome all response and there is an email or postal address for people to make contributions.""",The Home Office has agreed to meet civil liberties groups as part of a consultation it is conducting into UK interception laws.
"But Marcus Hutchins' own lawyer says he denies six charges of creating and distributing the Kronos malware. The 23-year-old from Ilfracombe, Devon, who helped stall the WannaCry cyber-attack which hit the NHS, was arrested on Wednesday in Las Vegas. He was granted $30,000 (£23,000) bail, but will spend the weekend in prison after not being able to pay on Friday. As he left the courtroom Mr Hutchins was ordered to walk with his hands behind his back but he was not shackled. No members of his family were present, but defence lawyer Adrian Lobo presented the judge with a bundle of letters. She said they were from friends and relatives showing support for a client who had never been in trouble with the law in the US or the UK. Mr Hutchins' mother, Janet Hutchins, has said her son's involvement is ""hugely unlikely"" because he has spent ""enormous amounts of time and even his free time"" combating malware. Defence lawyer Ms Lobo told the BBC: ""He's pled not guilty. He is standing by that and he fights the charges and we intend to fight the case in Wisconsin."" She described the federal indictment against him as ""pretty flimsy, it's pretty slim compared to what we normally see in a United States indictment."" Prosecutors told a Las Vegas court on Friday that Mr Hutchins had been caught in a sting operation when undercover officers bought the code. They claimed the software was sold for $2,000 in digital currency in June 2015. Dan Cowhig, prosecuting, also told the court that Mr Hutchins had made a confession during a police interview. ""He admitted he was the author of the code of Kronos malware and indicated he sold it,"" said Mr Cowhig. The lawyer claimed there was evidence of chat logs between Mr Hutchins and an unnamed co-defendant - who has yet to be arrested - where the security researcher complained of not receiving a fair share of the money. At the scene By James Cook, BBC North America correspondent There was no missing Marcus Hutchins as he was brought into courtroom 3C of the US District Court in Las Vegas. The ""surfer who saved the world"" was wearing a bright yellow custody-issue T-shirt and trousers along with luminous orange socks and sandals. Judge Nancy Kobbe was sympathetic to the defendant's plea to be released on bail, waving away a claim from a government lawyer that the cyber-security expert posed a risk to the public because he had gone shooting on a gun range popular with tourists. Mr Hutchins was so softly spoken that several times Ms Kobbe had to ask him to raise his voice. Ms Lobo said Mr Hutchins denied he was the author of the malware and said he would plead not guilty to all of the charges, which date between July 2014 and July 2015. ""He has dedicated his life to researching malware, not trying to harm people,"" she said. ""Use the internet for good is what he has done. ""He was completely shocked, this isn't' something he anticipated. He came here for a work-related conference and he was fully anticipating to go back home and had no reason to be fearful of coming or going from the United States."" Mr Hutchins came to prominence in May this year after finding a ""kill switch"" to stop the WannaCry ransomeware attack that hit the NHS, as well as other organisations in 150 countries. Also known as ""MalwareTech"" online, Mr Hutchins was hailed as an ""accidental hero"" after registering a domain name to track the spread of the virus, which actually ended up halting it. Mr Hutchins, who works for Los Angeles-based computer security firm Kryptos Logi, had been in Las Vegas to attend the Black Hat and Def Con cyber-security conferences. He was arrested at Las Vegas airport minutes before he was due to fly home. District judge Nancy Koppe, who was presented letters of support from Mr Hutchins' cyber-security colleagues, ordered his release on bail as he had no criminal history and because the allegations dated back two years. However, friends and family were unable to raise the bond money before the court closed on Friday, so he will not be released until Monday. The conditions of his bail include him not being allowed to access the internet and to stay in Clark County, Nevada, and within the Eastern District of Wisconsin, where he will appear in court on Tuesday. He must also be monitored by GPS and surrender his passport. What is Kronos? Kronos is a type of malware known as a Trojan, meaning it disguises itself as legitimate software. It is thought to be named after a mythological creature. Kronos first came to light in July 2014, when it was advertised on a Russian underground forum for $7,000 (£5,330) - a relatively high figure at the time. It was marketed as way to steal logins for banking websites and other financial data. Its vendor boasted it could evade existing anti-virus software and said it worked with the latest versions of Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome web browsers. In an unusual step, the developer promised free upgrades and bug fixes and the option of a $1,000 one week trial. After much publicity it faded from view until October 2015, when IBM researchers reported that Kronos had been spotted in attacks on UK and Indian bank websites. Kronos then struck again in Canada in May 2016, and in November reports surfaced that it had been spotted being distributed via emails. IT security consultant Robin Edgar said Mr Hutchins' own code had been incorporated into the malware, but he had not done anything wrong. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Mr Hutchins posted a tweet saying, 'look, this Kronos thing has taken my code, stolen my code and used it in it'. ""He was very unhappy his code had been stolen and used within Kronos. He didn't write Kronos, it looks like, but he wrote a little piece of code which was used in the malware."" Mr Hutchins' local MP in North Devon, Peter Heaton-Jones, said he shared the ""shock"" of the local community over the charges. The Conservative politician has written to Foreign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan to seek assurance that Mr Hutchins is receiving adequate consular assistance. Whilst Mr Heaton-Jones acknowledged the UK cannot interfere with court proceedings in the US and said he has made no judgement about his constituent, adding: ""People who know him in Ilfracombe, and in the wider cyber-community, are astounded at the allegations against him. ""This is particularly so given his role in helping to protect the NHS and many other institutions from what could have been a devastating cyber-attack just a few months ago. ""I will continue to monitor his case carefully and to seek the necessary assurances from the government that the UK is doing everything in its power to assist Marcus and his family at this very difficult time."" Digital rights group the Electronic Frontier Foundation said it was ""deeply concerned"" with his arrest, whilst Naomi Colvin, from civil liberties campaign group Courage, said Mr Hutchins ""did the world an enormous service"" when he stopped the WannaCry attack.

"The publication, called Project, is a monthly style and culture magazine that will be sold through Apple's App store. The publication comes head of an expected launch of a digital newspaper for the iPad called The Daily. The newspaper is expected to be launched by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation. It is part of Mr Murdoch's continuing efforts to find a sustainable model for his newspaper empire, which has seen increased competition from free content on the internet. In July, his Times newspaper began to charge customers to access its site, resulting in a 87% drop in readership online. At the New York launch, Mr Branson dismissed suggestions he was engaged in a war with Murdoch. ""It's not a battle,"" he said. ""It's all about choice, and a fair bit of competition doesn't hurt.""

"While it is a historic moment of sorts, Bitcoin is usually compared to the dollar. The virtual currency peaked at $6,649.33 (£5,015) at about 16:34 GMT on Wednesday, according to Bloomberg. The total value of Bitcoin in circulation is currently $110bn (£83bn) and the cryptocurrency has risen more than seven-fold against the dollar over the past year. The reason for the latest jump in value was in part driven by an announcement by US-based derivatives marketplace operator CME Group about a plan to launch a Bitcoin futures product before the end of the year. Bitcoin was launched in January 2009. Its value was lower than $100 in June 2013, and below $1,000 as recently as January. But in August, the virtual currency soared to $3,451 after a spin-off - Bitcoin Cash - failed to prove as disruptive as had been feared. And in September, Bitcoin crossed the $5,000 threshold for the first time. ""It's been a very innovative year - there have been a lot of new technology platforms for cryptocurrencies, which have lifted Bitcoin,"" Garrick Hileman a research fellow at University of Cambridge told the BBC. ""It wouldn't surprise me if the price were to go even higher."" Coinbase - a business that lets the public trade and store digital currencies - reports that it is now signing up between 35,000 to 50,000 new users per day. Mr Hileman said that many people had recently been attracted to invest in Bitcoin because when a ""fork"" happened in August, investors received an equivalent amount of new Bitcoin Cash coins for free. Another ""fork"", SegWit2x, is due to happen on 18 November. ""Rising geopolitical tensions on the Korean Peninsula are also driving interest in Bitcoin in the surrounding countries, because people are wary of investing in the yen or the dollar,"" Mr Hileman added. However, he continued, government regulators may crack down on cryptocurrencies, which could drive prices back down.","The price of Bitcoin has surpassed £5,000 per coin - a new record."
"By Joe MillerTechnology reporter The breaches were first publicised by security blogger Brian Krebs on Monday. The companies denied their classified networks had been infiltrated. However, the team that discovered the incidents has given the BBC access to an intelligence report, which indicates hundreds of files were indeed copied. The documents, which were stolen over a period of many months, relate to: Cyber Engineering Services (CyberESI) tracked the activities of the hackers over eight months between 2011 and 2012. It said the data taken by the hackers suggested they had been after intelligence relating to Iron Dome. Iron Dome is a complex anti-missile defence system, which can intercept and destroy rockets and shells. The technology has been widely credited with preventing the deaths of many Israeli civilians during the ongoing conflict with militants from Gaza. CyberESI's report, compiled in 2013, also indicates the attacks were made using highly sophisticated tools resembling those used by Chinese hackers to infiltrate US defence firms - an attack in which the Chinese government denies any involvement. ""The data collected makes strong indications that the actors behind this attack originated from China,"" it says. ""This assertion is based on the activity during the past year that Cyber Engineering Services has observed on compromised networks, as well as the geo-location of the IP [internet protocol] addresses retrieving the exfiltrated data."" ""The nature of exfiltrated data and the industry that these companies are involved in suggests that the Chinese hackers were after information related to Israel's all-weather air defence system called Iron Dome."" Gigabytes stolen CyberESI, which operates out of Maryland in the US, monitored data being stolen from two leading Israeli defence contractors: A spokeswoman for IAI initially confirmed to Mr Krebs the attack had taken place and been ""reported to the appropriate authorities"". However IAI subsequently said the ""information reported regarding the leakage of sensitive information is incorrect"" and only its ""civilian non-classified"" network had been hacked. A spokesman for Rafael said the company did ""not recall such an incident"". But the report seen by the BBC suggests sensitive data was taken from IAI and that Rafael's network was compromised, with hackers able to deactivate security software and harvest authentication data, including passwords. In total, the report says, gigabytes of data were stolen from the Israeli companies, including: Some of the stolen technical documents are said by CyberESI to have contained intellectual property data and were marked as being controlled by US government International Traffic in Arms (ITAR) regulations. US connections Both IAI and Rafael were heavily involved in developing the Iron Dome missile defence system, which allows Israel to intercept rockets fired by Hamas from the Gaza Strip. The US, which already collaborates with Israeli firms over Arrow III - jointly designed by IAI and Boeing, now wants to invest in future versions of Iron Dome technologies. In May 2013, the Pentagon accused China of carrying out a sophisticated cyber-spying campaign on US diplomatic, economic and defence organisations. The raid on the Israeli companies bore similar characteristics, experts at CyberESI told the BBC, using tools that were ""known to originate from"" China. The attacks were part of an advanced persistent threat (APT) - a form of highly organised and targeted hacking. APTs have been used for industrial espionage in the past and tend to use sophisticated methods not easily available to the vast majority of cyber-thieves. Executive emails stolen CyberESI's report also featured a third Israeli company, Elisra, originally a US company and now a leading supplier to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). Elisra, which is not involved in Iron Dome, appears to have been comprehensively infiltrated by the hackers, who stole data from folders named ""Military Spacs"" and ""UAV"" and infiltrated the email accounts belonging to the chief executive and several senior managers. The attackers also stole passwords and sign-in details, allowing them to roam around the networks undetected. Elisra did not respond to a BBC request for comment. In January 2014, another security company reported that 15 Israeli defence computers had been compromised via a malicious email attachment.",The BBC has seen evidence that appears to confirm hackers stole several secret military documents from two government-owned Israeli companies that developed the Iron Dome missile defence system.
"The video, for the company's Pure Hot and Cool Fan, suggests the fan is cordless when it actually needs to be plugged in, it said. Dyson told the ASA it did not think there was ""any reasonable prospect"" of consumers thinking a tower fan or purifier could be cordless. But after examining the ad, the ASA ordered it should not be shown again. No power sockets or electrical leads could be seen in the ad – until the final shot, when a cord appeared which was ""very thin and coloured grey on a light background"". ""The cord was the same colour, thickness and approximately the same length as the edge of the carpet which appeared opposite it on the screen,"" the ASA said. Dyson had argued that its fans had been on the market for more than a decade. ""None of those products had ever been cordless nor been advertised as being so,"" Dyson told the ASA. ""If Dyson were to create a cordless purifier it was reasonable to assume that this would be one of the key features which they would advertise."" The ASA was not convinced. It told Dyson in future not to imply that their fans were cordless unless they actually were.",An advert for one of Dyson's £400 fans has been labelled misleading by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA).
"The USB stick was cited in a report prepared by Glastonbury Town Council, calling for a UK government inquiry into the health effects of 5G networks. A security expert who took the device apart said it appeared to be a normal USB stick. The Somerset council says it has never recommended use of the device. In a statement on its website, the council said: ""Glastonbury Town Council does not, and has never recommended or endorsed the 5GBioShield or any other anti-5G devices offering protection against the supposed negative health effects of fifth-generation cellular network technology"". It made reference to the BBC's article but said the recommendation was from ""a member of the public"" and did not represent the ""official policy"" of the council. The 5GBioShield was recommended by Toby Hall, a member of the council's 5G advisory committee, who said he found use of the device ""helpful"". But a security expert who took the device apart said it appeared to be a normal USB stick. Tradings Standards is now seeking to halt sales of the £339 device, which it called a ""scam"". An executive summary of a report compiled by the council and recommending that the government and Public Health England conduct their own studies into the safety of 5G networks, remains on the council's website. But technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones, who led the BBC investigation, tweeted that the full report has been removed. Scientists have said that the is no evidence that mobile networks cause cancer or other illnesses.",A council has distanced itself from a device that claims to protect against 5G but which has now been dubbed a scam.
"The ASA said the image and text broke several rules, including encouraging unsafe practices during pregnancy and making claims about weight loss. The post was also not properly identified as an advert, it said. The ASA recently teamed up with ITV to create a checklist to encourage Love Island contestants to be ""upfront"" about their own social media ads. Skinny Caffe, the weight-loss brand promoted by Lucy, said she had posted the message as a favour to a friend and had not been paid for it. The firm was seeking to create brand awareness ahead of the model giving birth, and had planned a larger follow-up campaign later in the year. Skinny Caffe said it did not believe Lucy had implied that she had used its products while pregnant. Lucy concurred with Skinny Caffe's comments but acknowledged the text contained in her message had been provided by the brand. The ASA said it had investigated the matter after receiving 25 complaints from the public. Unsafe act Lucy rose to fame via a succession of reality TV series, including Signed by Katie Price, Ex on the Beach, and Celebrity Big Brother. She uploaded the offending post on 5 May. It showed the glamour model sitting by a table wearing underwear and socks, cradling a mug next to the products. The ASA noted that although this post did not refer to her pregnancy, comments under many of her other Instagram posts did. Moreover, it said that her pregnancy had been widely covered in the press. In light of this, the regulator said her fans might take the text's claim that she had used the products to stay ""in shape"" to imply she had consumed them recently. And, it added, this could encourage other mothers-to-be to do likewise. The ASA noted that the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence does not recommend dieting during pregnancy as it can harm the health of the unborn child. ""We concluded that the ad encouraged an unsafe practice and was irresponsible,"" the watchdog concluded. It also highlighted the fact that the text also claimed the products featured could help users ""lose up to 7lbs [3.2kg] in seven days"". According to the regulator, any health claims that refer to specific amounts of weight loss are not permitted in ads. The ASA does not have the power to issue fines, but can have problem ads taken down and works with platforms to have them removed. In serious instances, the authority can also refer incidents to Trading Standards, which does have the power to impose fines and prosecute offenders. The BBC has contacted Jemma Lucy for comment.",An Instagram post by reality star Jemma Lucy has been banned by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA).
"The telecoms company will kick off with a home broadband service in the capital but is also launching mobile services. It follows BT's EE and Vodafone in launching next generation 5G services in 2019. Three, which is owned by Hutchison, said it would not share details about the cost of its services until July. Chief executive Dave Dyson said: ""It's clear that consumers and businesses want more and more data. ""We have worked hard over a long period of time to be able to offer the best end-to-end 5G experience. EE launched 5G services in six cities in May, while Vodafone will launch one on 3 July. According to some, 5G will offer download speeds as much as 100 times faster than existing 4G networks. However, there have been concerns about the pricing and connectivity of such services. Both have also pulled smartphones made by the Chinese company Huawei from their 5G launches, because of uncertainty about support by Google's Android. The race for 5G is hotting up - even if Three is arriving with what feels like rather a lukewarm offering. While EE and Vodafone will both have 5G mobile phones in the hands of customers in a number of cities next month, Three is still only saying that its mobile offering will be rolled out ""by the end of 2019"". Its home broadband service is launching in London in August but we still don't know how it will be priced. 5G as a substitute for fixed broadband is an attractive idea - though possibly more useful in remote areas where firms are reluctant to lay fibre connections. But Three is confident that it has acquired more useful spectrum than its rivals, and when consumers really start to take an interest in 5G next year it will be well-placed to race ahead. The US has restricted Google and others from using Huawei technology amid concerns it could be used by Beijing for spying - claims which the Chinese firm has denied. Three said it would announce details of which handsets will be part of its mobile launch in July. It has suggested its own 5G network will be the fastest in the UK, claiming peak speeds could be more than twice as fast as its rivals. After London it plans to launch in: Birmingham, Brighton, Bristol, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Nottingham, Sheffield and Sunderland before the end of the year. Is 5G safe? Analysis by BBC Reality Check Some people have questioned whether there are health risks from 5G, but experts and regulators say there is no evidence of danger. Similar fears were expressed around earlier mobile internet and wi-fi. More than 200 scientists appealed to the EU to halt the rollout of 5G, saying that electromagnetic fields may be harmful to humans and the environment, and could increase cancer risks. But the EU says exposure from 5G will be far below limits set by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). ""There has been no evidence to suggest that electromagnetic waves from mobile phones and networks are bad for your health,"" says Prof Malcolm Sperrin, Director of the Department of Medical Physics and Clinical Engineering at Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust. He says a causal link between mobile phone use and cancer in humans is unproven. 5G technology is new but experts believe it poses no greater risk than earlier mobile systems.","Three will launch its first 5G network this August in London, before extending it to 25 other UK towns and cities before the end of the year."
"Some of the watches are targeted mainly at dementia patients - and a hacker could even send a reminder to ""take pills"" as often as they wanted to. The researchers said they were concerned that ""an overdose could easily result"". The security flaw has now been fixed after they notified the Chinese company behind it, they said. However, the app that connects to these types of watches has more than 10 million downloads, the researchers say - and there is no way of knowing if it had been exploited by someone else before being fixed. The flaw was discovered by UK-based security firm Pen Test Partners. It was in a system called SETracker, used in a wide range of relatively cheap smartwatches made by several different companies, and widely available online. ""We can make any watch reveal the position of the wearer, we can listen to the wearer without them knowing, and we can also alert them to take medication,"" said Ken Munro, a partner at Pen Test. The watches targeted at dementia patients could be useful in scenarios such as the patient getting lost while out for a walk. If that happened, they could trigger a call to their carer, who could track their location, the company said. The ""take pills"" notification could let a carer send the reminder from afar. ""This is where it all went wrong,"" the researchers wrote in a blog post. ""Anyone with some basic hacking skills... could trigger the medication alert as often as they want. ""A dementia sufferer is unlikely to remember that they had already taken their medication."" The China-based manufacturer responded within days of being notified of the flaw, and repaired it on their end, securing the system without the need for users to install any updates. ""This is a standard sort of problem that is so common,"" commented Prof Harold Thimbleby of Swansea University. ""People think programming is easy. And they rush stuff out, they start selling it, and they don't check it."" ""Our culture thinks programming is exciting and children can do it. And of course they can,"" he said. ""My children can build stuff in Lego, but I wouldn't let them build a skyscraper - but that's what we do in programming.""","Smartwatch software used to help elderly patients could easily be hacked and abused, security researchers say."
"The social network suspended Richard Spencer on 15 November. Since then, he was filmed shouting: ""Hail Trump, hail our people, hail victory,"" at a meeting, prompting some audience members to raise their arms in Nazi-style salutes. A leading anti-racism campaigner has criticised Twitter's decision. The technology company told the BBC that Mr Spencer had been temporarily blocked for running multiple accounts and not - as had been speculated - for hate speech offences. ""Our rules explicitly prohibit creating multiple accounts with overlapping uses,"" said a spokesman for the company. ""When we temporarily suspend multiple accounts for this violation, the account owner can designate one account for reinstatement."" He added that Mr Spencer's other accounts would remain blocked. Should the BBC use 'alt-right' or not? Mr Spencer is president of the white nationalist think tank the National Policy Institute. He has not commented about his reinstatement, beyond posting a Gif from the Terminator film alongside the words ""I'm back"". He had previously accused Twitter of ""purging"" him and others based on their views. These include support for the idea of ""ethno-states"" - nations whose citizens share a common ancestry. Mr Spencer has denied links to neo-Nazism, and defended his supporters' arm gestures at the filmed Washington DC event, saying they were ""Roman salutes"" given ""in the spirit of ironic exuberance"". But one critic has warned that his return to Twitter poses dangers. ""He has access to hundreds of thousands of people and can poison minds, often those of young impressionable people,"" said Gerry Gable, founder of the anti-fascist Searchlight magazine. ""If the the industry can't get together to put a stop to this, then governments have got to step in and take some action."" Mr Spencer was banned from visiting the UK earlier this year by the then Home Secretary, Theresa May, who suggested his views would ""foster hatred which might lead to inter-community violence"". He has also been temporarily barred from visiting 26 other European countries, for taking part in an illegal meeting in Hungary in 2014. US President-elect Donald Trump has also voiced concern. When questioned about the alt-right meeting at which the salutes were given, Mr Trump said: ""It is not a group I want to energise, and if they are energised I want to look into it and find out why... I condemn [them]. I disavow and condemn."" What is the alt-right? Supporters of the alt-right movement differ on many points, but are generally outspoken in their attacks on multiculturalism, globalisation and immigration. Their targets also include what they see as political correctness and feminism. Steve Bannon - President-elect Donald Trump's chief strategist and former head of Breitbart News, which has covered the movement - defined it as ""younger people who are anti-globalists, very nationalist, terribly anti-establishment"". He added that it had ""some racial and anti-Semitic overtones"". The Associated Press news agency has expressed caution about using the designation. ""The term may exist primarily as a public-relations device to make its supporters' actual beliefs less clear and more acceptable to a broader audience,"" its staff were told last month. ""In the past, we have called such beliefs racist, neo-Nazi or white supremacist.""","Twitter has reinstated the account of a white nationalist think tank leader credited with coining the term ""alt-right""."
"By David Molloy & Leo KelionTechnology news Three of Christopher Nolan's biggest films - The Dark Knight, Inception, and The Prestige - were shown in the game's Party Royale mode. What players saw, and at what time, depended on what country you're in. But why would anyone want to watch a film inside a video game? Join the metaverse ""The real world is unbeatable, in my opinion,"" says Darshan Shankar, the founder of Bigscreen VR - a company that lets users watch films together in cinemas created within virtual reality. ""Things like Fortnite and Bigscreen don't necessarily replace the awesomeness of a real world cinema,"" he says, instead it's about being ""able to watch things together with people"". Browser extensions for Netflix and the BBC's iPlayer also exist for those wanting to watch films and TV shows together while apart, so they can text and chat about the action as it unfolds. But Fortnite - like Bigscreen - has the potential to take this to another level by giving users a sense of being in the same space. Fortnite's first attempt on Friday largely went well, with US viewers enjoying Inception, while UK audiences saw The Prestige. Vice wrote that the experience was ""more fun"" than a real cinema - pointing out that not only can tomatoes be hurled at the screen, but annoying audience members can be muted. But the test wasn't perfectly smooth - some players reported seeing blank screens, and there was confusion over the fact that different countries had different show times, and not all were included. It's not the first time Fortnite has tried something like this. It debuted a clip from the last Star Wars movie last year, and was also first to show a trailer for Nolan's next film, Tenet, in May. Spy action film Tenet was supposed to come to cinemas on 17 July and help bring people back to the multiplex post-lockdown. But it has been repeatedly delayed, with 12 August given as its latest release date. For obvious reasons, in-game movie screenings don't face the same health-risk headaches. Director John Madden: 'I wouldn't object' The Oscar-nominated director of Shakespeare in Love, The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel and Miss Sloane took time out from editing his latest movie to give the BBC his view on Fortnite's Movie Nite phenomenon ""Speaking as a filmmaker, I wouldn't object to a film I had made finding an opening in an unlikely setting, assuming it was in the later part of the film's release cycle. ""That said, Christopher Nolan's work might seem a better fit than mine to the Fortnite community! ""I think that film distribution is bound to evolve, particularly in the aftermath of the Covid cataclysm, and provided that the film can be seen initially in the setting the director intended, it seems churlish to object to attempts to bring any work to a wider audience."" Fortnite has already hosted interactive concerts, including a major event by Travis Scott that saw players teleport around the map and into outer space. Nearly 28 million people took part, and many more watched recordings on YouTube and elsewhere. It's all part of what the media is calling Fortnite's ""metaverse"" - a move to turning the game into a place to hang out, rather than just play it the way it was designed. Some argue that Fortnite has essentially become its own social network. The film night was similar to the Tenet trailer screening, in that players could move around, dance and ""emote"" as well as look at the screen while it played. That hardly sounds like perfect film-viewing conditions. Secret Cinema has proved there's huge appeal in hosting events where the action occurs both on and off-screen simultaneously in its immersive cinema experiences. Visitors watched a DeLorean racing round the audience at its Back to the Future event, and the crowd twirling in time at its Dirty Dancing experience. Max Alexander, its chief executive, says congregating to watch a movie has been important since ""the grand old days of cinema"". There's some ""richness that's missed"" without other people, he says. ""I think Fortnite's really interesting. The avatars are really viewed like extensions of the player."" And like Secret Cinema itself, he says there is the opportunity to ""have a relationship with everybody else - not just the people you've come with"". 'You want your art to be seen' Ben Barfoot, a British indie director, remembers that many of the films that influenced him were watched in noisy, distracting settings using what was then the latest in home entertainment tech. As an example, he recalls his video-taped copy of Peter Jackson's 1987 sci-fi film Bad Taste. ""All my mates would sit around, and we'd talk over it, and just be chatting, but we'd see it, quote it to each other… we'd go back and watch it again,"" he says. And he adds he would welcome the opportunity for a new generation of film fans to discover his movie Double Date within a video game. ""You want your art to be seen,"" he says. ""What's worse? No-one seeing your film, or loads of people seeing your film, but not in the perfect circumstances?"" Nolan himself hasn't said why he got on board with Fortnite. And it might seem an odd tie-up for a director known to be a champion of the real-world cinema screen. But Epic Games - Fortnite's creator - provided some insight when it explained why it was picked to launch Tenet's trailer last month. ""When we do anything like this, it's always born and driven from a relationship between creatives trying to bring something we think is awesome to life,"" said Epic's creative director Donald Mustard.",Fortnite players stowed away their guns this week to kick back for a movie screening instead.
"The attack, which used a malicious program called ""Chewbacca"", was discovered by security company RSA. The server at the centre of the attack has now been shut down but not before thieves managed to grab details of 24 million transactions. Retailers in 11 separate nations fell victim to the attack including shops in Russia, Canada, Australia and the US. In the blogpost detailing the shutdown, security analyst Yotam Gottesman said the thieves grabbed data from equipment at cash tills in ""several dozen"" shops. RSA has contacted the shops and told them about the attack. On point-of-sale equipment the malicious software disguised itself as a file that handled printing. It was given the name ""Chewbacca"" because the login page for the server collating data from infected machines features a picture of the Star Wars wookiee. The group behind the attack tried to hide its tracks by routing stolen data through the Tor network that many people use to hide where they are browsing from. Chewbacca comes in the wake of an attack on giant US retailer Target in late 2013. That attack also inserted malware on cash tills and card swipe devices and managed to scoop up details of more than 40 million credit and debit cards. Luxury department store Neiman Marcus was also hit by thieves who used a similar tactic to grab card and personal details. The attacks led the FBI to issue a warning to retailers alerting them to the changing attack patterns used by thieves and asking them to be vigilant about their point-of-sale equipment.",Swift action has stopped an attack that stole credit and debit card details from retailers in 11 nations.
"By Dave LeeTechnology reporter, BBC News The site's owner, Canadian Gary Fung, has agreed to pay $110m (£68m) to the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA). MPAA chairman Chris Dodd said the move was a ""major step forward"" for legitimate commerce online. In a blog post, Mr Fung said: ""It's sad to see my baby go."" The site is currently still online, but will soon be shut. It is one of the most popular sites of its kind on the internet. A group of companies, including Disney, Paramount and Twentieth Century Fox, accused the site of wilfully infringing copyright by listing millions of popular movies and TV programmes - in a court battle that has lasted for more than seven years. Now Mr Fung has agreed to settle. He added: ""I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race and I have remained faithful. 10.5 years of IsoHunt has been a long journey by any business definition and forever in internet start-up time. ""It started as a programming hobby in my university days that has become so, so much more."" Court documents acknowledged that it is unlikely that Mr Fung's company could pay $110m, and that the MPAA would probably receive between $2m and $4m. Degree of separation Like a similar site, The Pirate Bay, that has been blocked in the UK by a court order, IsoHunt did not host pirated material itself. It instead acted as a directory of sources from which to download illegal files. According to court documents, Mr Fung's defence hinged on this degree of separation - and argued that it was the users of IsoHunt responsible for distributing pirated material, not IsoHunt. The Californian court disagreed. ""It sends a strong message that those who build businesses around encouraging, enabling, and helping others to commit copyright infringement are themselves infringers, and will be held accountable for their illegal actions,"" said MPAA chairman Mr Dodd. ""The successful outcome of this landmark lawsuit will also will help preserve jobs and protect the tens of thousands of businesses in the creative industries, whose hard work and investments are exploited by sites like IsoHunt."" 'Reluctant revolutionary' Ahead of the ruling, Mr Fung had taken to social news site Reddit to take part in an AMAA - Ask Me Almost Anything - session. In it, he described himself as a ""reluctant revolutionary"", and backed calls for copyright reform. He said he did not hold a disregard for the law, and acted upon requests to remove links to pirated content when the company was made aware. He also said the industry could render sites like IsoHunt obsolete if it offered simultaneous releases worldwide, as well as digital offerings that were cheaper than physical copies. His thoughts echoed findings by a trio of researchers at George Mason University in Virginia, US. Their site piracydata.org has been collating the weekly top 10 most-pirated films and investigating whether legal digital methods were available. They found that half of the movies in the list were not available to access legally online. Furthermore, none of the 10 titles could be streamed - arguably the most straightforward way to consume media online. However, in contrast, efforts by Fox to curb piracy of TV series The Walking Dead fell flat. Despite the first episode of the latest series being made available to stream free online, the programme was still illegally downloaded more than 500,000 times, according to data gathered by Torrentfreak.com.

"By Dan SimmonsClick presenter Troels Oerting, head of Europol's cybercrime centre, told BBC Click people should send personal data only across networks they trusted. He said the warning was motivated by the growing number of attacks being carried out via public wi-fi. Europol is helping a number of countries after such attacks, he said. Stolen data ""We have seen an increase in the misuse of wi-fi, in order to steal information, identity or passwords and money from the users who use public or insecure wi-fi connections,"" he said. ""We should teach users that they should not address sensitive information while being on an open insecure wi-fi internet. ""They should do this from home where they know actually the wi-fi and its security, but not if you are in a coffee shop somewhere you shouldn't access your bank or do all of these things that actually transfer very sensitive information."" Mr Oerting said Europol, which helps co-ordinate investigations into organised crime across Europe, was assisting several member states who had seen attacks carried out on wi-fi networks. The attackers were not using novel techniques, he said, but relied on well-known approaches that attempt to trick people into connecting to a hotspot that, superficially, resembles those seen in cafes, pubs and restaurants and other public spaces. 'Man in the middle' The attacks meant that data swapped when people communicate with a bank, shop via the web or log in to social media sites could be captured by attackers. ""Everything that you send through the wi-fi is potentially at risk, and this is something that we need to be very concerned about both as individual users but also as police,"" he told Click. Mr Oerting's warning comes only a few months after the European parliament turned off its public wi-fi system after it was discovered that a ""man-in-the-middle"" attack was being perpetrated via the service. As its name implies, in this attack thieves attempt to insert themselves between users and a hotspot to gather all data passing between the two points. The warning was echoed by Charlie McMurdie, former head of the UK's cybercrime unit and now a senior security analyst at PWC. ""A lot of mainstream criminals have identified there are easy opportunities and vulnerabilities just walking down the street and exploiting wi-fi networks that exist in every coffee shop,"" she said. Rogue hotspots Large companies were also falling victim to this type of crime, said Ms McMurdie, because they were not watching out for the rogue hotspots that are regularly turning up. Sometimes, said Ms McMurdie, attackers used hotspots to get at particular individuals rather than to grab all the data flowing from everyone using a public network. Everyone needed to be aware of what they were putting at risk when they use wi-fi networks and the data it can potentially hand over to criminals. ""There is the need for raising awareness of what the vulnerabilities are and what you should be doing to protect yourself whether you're on the move or in a physical location,"" she said. The BBC Click investigation into how safe public wi-fi hotspots are can be seen on the Click TV show this weekend.","Sensitive information should not be sent over public wi-fi hotspots, to avoid hackers stealing it, Europe's top cybercrime police officer has warned."
"By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter Firstly via the loyalty cards we scan at checkouts, and more and more so from our online baskets, our shopping habits are no longer a secret. But now more retailers are using AI (artificial intelligence) - software systems that can learn for themselves - to try to automatically predict and encourage our very specific preferences and purchases like never before. Retail consultant Daniel Burke, of Blick Rothenberg, calls this ""the holy grail... to build up a profile of customers and suggest a product before they realise it is what they wanted"". So the next time you dash into your local shop to buy certain snacks and a particular wine on a Friday night, perhaps you can blame AI, and a computer that has learned all about you, for the decision. Will Broome is the founder of Ubamarket, a UK firm that makes a shopping app that allows people to pay for items via their phones, make lists, and scan products for ingredients and allergens. ""Our AI system tracks people's behaviour patterns rather than their purchases, and the more you shop the more the AI knows about what kinds of products you like,"" he says. ""The AI module is designed not only to do the obvious stuff, but it learns as it goes along and becomes anticipatory. It can start to build a picture of how likely you are to try a different brand, or to buy chocolate on a Saturday."" And it can offer what he calls ""hyper-personalised offers"", like cheaper wine on a Friday night. Ubamarket has struggled to persuade the UK's biggest supermarkets to adopt the app, so it has instead done deals with smaller convenience shop chains in the UK including Spar, Co-op and Budgens, stores not traditionally associated with hi-tech. Take-up of the app remains low but it is growing, in part thanks to the coronavirus pandemic, which has made people more reluctant to touch tills or stand in queues. ""With the app we have found that the average contents of a basket are up 20%, and people with the app are three times more likely to return to shop in that store,"" says Mr Broome. In Germany, a Berlin start-up called SO1 is doing similar things with its AI system for retailers. It claims that nine times more people buy AI-suggested goods than those offered by traditional promotions, even when the discounts are 30% less. Getting offers on goods that you actually might want to buy rather than random coupons is great for consumers. However, Jeni Tennison, who heads up the UK's Open Data Institute, a body that campaigns against the misuse of data, remains cautious about the vast amounts of information on people that is being collected. ""People are happy to be recommended products, but start to feel more uncomfortable when they are being nudged, or manipulated, into particular buys based on a caricature of who they are rather than the full complexity of their personality,"" she says. And she adds that there are bigger societal questions raised by the use of AI in retail. ""We need to ask how equitable and ethical the data collection is. So, for example, are middle-class white women being offered money off fresh vegetables, but it is not being offered to someone who could really benefit from it?"" says Ms Tennison. ""What we really need to understand is what impact data collection and profiling has on different sectors of society. Is it profiling people based on race, social economic status, sexuality?"" Online giant Amazon is no stranger to data collection. It has vast amounts of information on its customers from their online purchases, and via its products such as Ring doorbells and Echo speakers. It is now making a move into physical retailing, with bricks-and-mortar shops packed full of AI-aided computer vision technology. It means that in its Amazon Go grocery stores, currently up and running at 27 locations in the US, people can shop with no interaction with a human or a till. They simply swipe their smartphones on the scanner when they enter the supermarket, pick up what they want to buy, and then just walk out. The AI is watching of course, and sends you a bill at the end. The first Amazon Go stores were small sites, because of the expense of the sensors and equipment needed, but the company is gradually expanding to larger stores. Amazon is also working on tech for supermarkets that don't want to retrofit their stores with such costly systems. This is where its Dash Cart comes in, a supermarket trolley that is packed with sensors to detect and collate everything you put in. In the Los Angeles store where it is being tested, it has a special fast lane to check out, without the need for a human, of course. Another US retailer, Kroger, is experimenting with smart shelves fitted with LCD displays that beam contextualised content designed to draw customers towards them. Some display offers and personalised content by connecting via Bluetooth to loyalty apps on phones. More than three-quarters of large retailers around the world either have AI systems now in place, or plan to install them before the end of the year, according to research group Gartner. Its analyst Sandeep Unni says the global pandemic has accelerated this trend because it has dramatically changed consumer habits. ""People panic bought, and focused on essential rather than non-essential goods, which in turn created a huge supply-demand imbalance,"" he says. ""This meant that we saw shelves becoming empty, and demand forecasting was suddenly not working."" New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape. US firm Afresh makes AI-based supply systems for supermarkets to help best plan for what stock levels are required. Afresh founder Matt Schwartz says that staff have to teach the AI systems about key events in the calendar, such as the recent Halloween. ""Historically taking account of things like holidays [and other events] has been one of the biggest challenges for AI,"" he says. ""[And] we can't fully automate away the humans. The AI may suggest 20 cases of pumpkins for October, and the humans can adjust that if they need to.""",The shopping lists we used to scribble on the back of an envelope are increasingly already known by the supermarkets we frequent.
"Compiled by Arbor Networks, the report looks at 10 years of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. The ease with which they could be staged had made them a favourite for groups with a grudge, said Arbor. Also, it said, insecure home routers were being enrolled into large groups of devices that mounted the attacks. Extortion attempt In the early days of DDoS, cybercrime gangs had used them to extort cash from websites run by betting and gambling firms that could not afford to be knocked offline, said Darren Anstee, a senior analyst at Arbor. Now, he said, attacks were being mounted by different groups and had grown considerably in size. In 2011, the biggest attacks had flung about 100 gigabits per second (Gbps) of data at targets, found the report. In 2014 that peak had hit 400Gbps and in the same year there had been four times as many attacks over 100Gbps than in the previous 12 months. ""There's been a massive jump in the number of very large attacks going on out there,"" said Mr Anstee. ""In 2014 we saw more volumetric attacks, with attackers trying to knock people offline by saturating their access to the internet."" Almost 40% of the organisations Arbor contacted for its report said they were being hit by more than 21 attacks per month, said the report. Part of the reason for the shift to the large attacks could be explained by a change in the technologies being used to stage them, he said. When cybercrime gangs had been behind the majority of attacks, the data barrages had been generated by the thousands of hijacked home computers they had had under their control, he said. Botnets were still used to mount extortion attacks, he said, and were also used to divert the attention of a company's security team so they did not notice a separate attack on another part of a company's infrastructure. Figures in the report suggested that companies were getting better at spotting the early stages of an attack and recovering once they were hit, he said. However, said Mr Anstee, building a botnet was difficult for hacktivists and others, who had instead turned to other net-connected devices and technologies to generate the huge data flows. Some attacks abused the net's timekeeping system or the domain servers that kept a list of which website was where, he said. Other groups had found ways to enrol insecure home net gateways and routers into attacks, he added. Hacktivists, hacker groups such as Lizard Squad and gamers who wanted revenge on other players were the bigger users of these tactics, said Mr Anstee. It was now easy to find so-called ""booter"" services online that let gamers kick rivals off a particular gaming network or title by attacking that network, he said. DDoS was also being used by people keen to use their technical skills express their feelings about a real-world conflict. ""If you look at DDoS attacks and try to tie them up with geopolitical events in the last few years, you will always see those events echoed in cyberspace,"" he said.","Hacktivists and gamers are becoming big users of net attacks that knock sites offline by bombarding them with data, suggests a report."
"Dave LeeNorth America technology reporter However, the cautious recommendations from the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) will, initially at least, insist on a fully licensed driver being behind the wheel, ready to take over in an emergency or if the technology fails. California has been the testing ground for most of the development, and so regulations in the state are considered to be precedent-setting. Prospective users of self-driving cars will need to undergo special training, and manufacturers would be required to monitor the cars' use. Answering a common query, regulators said any traffic violations or accidents would remain the responsibility of the human driver. 'Potential risks' Many firms are investing heavily in researching and creating self-driving vehicles, such as Ford, Uber and Tesla. Google, which leads the research field, has made a self-driving car without any controls such as steering wheels or pedals. But the DMV's proposals would mean such vehicles would not, for the foreseeable future at least, be made available for consumers. A statement from the DMV read: ""Given the potential risks associated with deployment of such a new technology, DMV believes that manufacturers need to obtain more experience in testing driverless vehicles on public roads prior to making this technology available to the general public."" Instead, any car offering self-driving capability must also be fitted with traditional controls - such as the adapted Lexus Google has been testing on roads already. Protection This slightly dampens hopes that self-driving technology would enable those who are currently unable to drive - such as people with disabilities - to get on the roads. However, the DMV said it would reassess the safety of fully-autonomous vehicles in the future. A public consultation on the draft will take place in the new year. The draft also adds requirements for manufacturers to ensure that vehicles are protected from cyber attacks.

"By Mark WardTechnology correspondent, BBC News The proof-of-concept worm was written to illustrate how vulnerable such data stores are to malicious attack. The worm can exploit the many bugs researcher Jacob Holcomb found in popular home data storage systems. Already, he said, there was evidence cybercriminals had noticed how easy it was to exploit these data stores. Game over Mr Holcomb started work on the worm after carrying out a series of tests on Network Attached Storage (NAS) systems made by 10 separate manufacturers. Many people connect these devices to a home router to give family members a place to put important files such as photos and films or to act as a back-up for other gadgets. Some home routers can also connect to hard drives to turn them into an NAS-type device. Mr Holcomb's investigation revealed 30 separate undocumented vulnerabilities in the NAS devices. Many of these, if exploited, would give an attacker complete control over a device letting them plunder the data on it, or use it as a way to get at other devices on that home network and spy on what people did online. Most of the exploitable problems he found were in the web-based interface typically used to administer these devices. ""I took the series of exploits I found and wrapped them into a software package that's in essence self-replicating,"" said Mr Holcomb. The worm runs on an infected system and once it has taken control uses that system's resources to scan net addresses seeking out other vulnerable devices. If an address gives an appropriate response, it sends a series of data requests to ""fingerprint"" that device so it knows which vulnerabilities to try against it. ""Once these devices are exposed to the internet, it's pretty much game over because most vulnerabilities can be exploited using authentication bypass techniques or with no authentication at all,"" he told the BBC. Mr Holcomb is set to demonstrate how the worm works during a speech at the Black Hat Europe security conference being held in Amsterdam this week. To safeguard vulnerable hardware, he plans to run it on a closed network rather than live on the net. Although Mr Holcomb's worm was written to demonstrate the danger these insecure data stores represent, he said there was evidence that cyber-thieves were waking up to the treasure trove of data these devices can contain. In early 2014, a malicious program called TheMoon targeted hardware made by Linksys and in early October a malicious campaign was launched against NAS boxes made by Qnap. ""These attacks are definitely becoming more widespread,"" said Mr Holcomb. Information about the vulnerabilities found in NAS boxes has been passed to manufacturers, said Mr Holcomb, and many were now updating the software that controls the devices to fix the bugs. Qnap has issued an update for the firmware running on the gadgets vulnerable to the bug abused earlier this month. Mr Holcomb said it was possible to use NAS safely if owners took some straightforward steps such as turning off unwanted features and services and ensuring the device can only be administered from within a home network rather than across the web.",A malicious worm that can roam the net seeking data stored on insecure hardware has been created by a security researcher.
"By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor The location-tracking tech would enable a week's worth of manual detective work to be done in an instant, they say. But the academics say no-one should be forced to enrol - at least initially. UK health chiefs have confirmed they are exploring the idea. ""NHSX is looking at whether app-based solutions might be helpful in tracking and managing coronavirus, and we have assembled expertise from inside and outside the organisation to do this as rapidly as possible,"" said the tech-focused division's chief Matthew Gould. Instant alerts The study by the team at the University of Oxford's Big Data Institute and Nuffield Department of Medicine was published in the journal Science. It proposes that an app would record people's GPS location data as they move about their daily lives. This would be supplemented by users scanning QR (quick response) codes posted to public amenities in places where a GPS signal is inadequate, as well as Bluetooth signals. If a person starts feeling ill, it is suggested they use the app to request a home test. And if it comes back positive for Covid-19, then an instant signal would be sent to everyone they had been in close contact with over recent days. Those people would be advised to self-isolate for a fortnight, but would not be told who had triggered the warning. In addition, the test subject's workplace and their transport providers could be told to carry out a decontamination clean-up. ""The constrictions that we're currently under place [many people] under severe strain,"" said the paper's co-lead Prof Christophe Fraser. ""Therefore if you have the ability with a bit more information and the use of an app to relax a lockdown, that could provide very substantial and direct benefits. ""Also I think a substantial number of lives can be saved."" To encourage take-up, it is suggested the app also acts as a hub for coronavirus-related health services and serves as a means to request food and medicine deliveries. The academics note that similar smartphone software has already been deployed in China. It was also voluntary there, but users were allowed to go into public spaces or on public transport only if they had installed it. One of the ethics specialists involved in the Oxford study said he did not think similar arrangements would be appropriate in the UK, but added that private enterprises might still impose restrictions. ""My favourite restaurant might ask me to show that I was low-risk before allowing me into a crowded place, and I think that would be a perfectly reasonable price to pay for this step towards returning to normal life,"" Prof Michael Parker told the BBC. He added that employers might also be justified in requiring staff to use the app if they worked ""in an old people's home, with vulnerable groups or [were based] in very crowded places"". And while he said that the general public should not be compelled to use the app to begin with, he did not rule this out if the majority failed to do so. ""The key question is - does it require everyone to do it for it to be effective?"" Prof Parker explained. ""It's not essential that everyone does... but perhaps a high proportion of the population needs to. ""This is a really unusual situation where lives are at risk, so there is a case to be made to make at least some actions compulsory - but there would need to be a really clear case for that and careful oversight."" Extended range The paper adds that the app could be updated to tackle the pandemic more aggressively if required. For example, it says, the stay-at-home alerts could be expanded to second or even third-degree contacts. And while the paper advocates the app being used in conjunction with home tests, Prof Fraser said his team was currently exploring whether it would still be effective if it relied on people using a questionnaire or 111 helpline advisers to diagnose the condition. He acknowledged some people might be wary of using the service, but hoped they would do so to ""save a lot of lives"". ""We already have tracking apps on our phones for more trivial tasks - the reason we have live traffic information is because we allow the people that provide the mapping service to track us,"" he said. ""What we're suggesting here is essentially sharing anonymised information [to] put to good use."" We know that the UK is preparing to roll out its own contact-tracing app and this paper by scientists who are close to the government reinforces what a vital role it could play. But it also shows why it may be a while before any app is rolled out. A key part of making the process by which people are informed that they have been in contact with someone infected with Covid-19 is the availability of testing. With only 11,000 tests a day available right now, most people who installed an app might find it of little use if they developed mild symptoms of the virus. Without a confirmed diagnosis, nothing would happen. The other concern is privacy. With the government wary of being seen as Big Brother, the app would need to convince users it wouldn't allow them to be spied on for ever more. Singapore's TraceTogether, which has been praised by privacy experts for collecting a bare minimum of data, could provide a template for the NHS app. Rather than constantly tracking people, it uses Bluetooth to record your proximity to other app users so that they can be alerted if you later test positive for the virus. But while the government will almost certainly make use of the app optional, the concern is that it could become essential for anyone wanting to return to normal life. What, for instance, is to stop pubs and restaurants demanding to see evidence of your Covid status before allowing you in? When the app does emerge, there will be a major marketing exercise behind it to convince as many people as possible to install it. It will only be effective if a good proportion of the population are persuaded that it will help the UK beat the virus - and let them leave home and get back to work.","A coronavirus app that alerts people if they have recently been in contact with someone testing positive for the virus ""could play a critical role"" in limiting lockdowns, scientists advising the government have said."
"The council had successfully applied for European Commission State Aid funding for the scheme. The council argues that it will help local areas which are underserved by existing providers. However Virgin Media argues there is ""significant overbuild"" with its current network. Birmingham City Council wants to build a 100+Mbps (megabits per second) broadband network to serve specific local areas including Digbeth, Eastside and the city's Jewellery Quarter. It says that businesses in those areas do not have access to ""affordable"" high speed broadband. It is one of the first European cities to acquire EC State Aid for a superfast broadband initiative and the council claims ""up to 1,000 jobs"" could be created by the project. 'Test case' Councillor James McKay said the council was ""extremely disappointed"" by the actions of BT and Virgin Media. ""The city has worked in a very positive and collaborative way with them over the last few years to help inform and develop our business case and we are surprised that they have now chosen to appeal at such a late stage,"" he said in a statement. ""We are liaising with government and the European Commission and we are advocating that this matter be treated with some urgency as a 'test case' for Europe and that everything that can be done to expedite it through the legal process is done."" Virgin Media said the plan ""involves a significant overbuild"" with its existing network. ""We fully support the Urban Broadband Fund and government ambitions to bring superfast broadband to areas not currently served by existing fibre networks,"" said the broadband provider. ""So it's disappointing that Birmingham City Council has put forward a scheme which is not in the interests of local people and we believe, as a result, the European Commission has made a decision based on inaccurate and misleading information which could waste public money."" ""Virgin and BT have had plenty of time to modernise, and they haven't,"" said Chris Conder, a campaigner for rural broadband. ""It's time to stand up for the Davids against these Goliaths."" Birmingham was on the original list of 10 UK destinations set to benefit initially from a £100m UK government fund to create ""super-connected"" cities.

"Dave LeeNorth America technology reporter The May 2016 protest, arranged by a group named Heart of Texas, was one example of Kremlin-backed efforts to destabilise the American electoral process. Lawyers for three technology companies - Facebook, Twitter and Google - were told they were grossly underestimating the scale of the problem. ""You just don't get it,"" said California Senator Dianne Feinstein. ""What we’re talking about is a cataclysmic change. What we’re talking about is the beginning of cyber-warfare."" She added: ""We are not going to go away, gentlemen. This is a very big deal."" In the streets Facebook said earlier this week that as many as 126 million people might have been reached by Russian propaganda efforts, a combination of paid advertisements and so-called ""organic"" posts that spread naturally as other users share the content. It added on Wednesday that an additional 16 million users could have been reached via photo-sharing app Instagram, which the company also owns. It was organic posts that were under the most scrutiny from the Senate Intelligence Committee on Wednesday. Senator Mark Warner, the committee's deputy chairman, discussed how the Russian-made Heart of Texas group amassed 250,000 followers. The group then created an event to be held at an Islamic culture centre in Houston. The event was titled ""Stop Islamization of Texas"". The protest duly took place, as did a counter-protest. Local media at the time reported that the organisers ""could not be found"" at the event. Another example shared on Wednesday showed an account sharing ""benign"" posts on Christianity later shifting to anti-Hillary Clinton posts after the group had reached a critical mass of users. Twitter, too, faced criticism for potentially under-reporting the extent of automated bots on its network. The firm's lawyer Sean Edgett said Twitter's own research suggested that less than 5% of its 330 million users were bots. Senator Warner, however, said independent research suggested the number was perhaps as high as 12-15%. Fake news The companies, speaking individually but agreeing on every issue, said they were ""deeply concerned"" that they had become the leading platforms for ""fake news"" on the internet. ""We cannot defeat this evolving shared threat alone,"" Facebook's top lawyer Colin Stretch said. However, none of the firms would commit to backing the Honest Ads Act, which would regulate online advertising, focusing on greater transparency around political advertising. Twitter's Mr Edgett said the companies wanted some ""fine-tuning"" to the proposals but supported its goals. Several senators suggested that more hearings and consultation would be needed, expressing their frustration that the companies were not being represented by higher-ranking executives. ""I'm disappointed that you're here, and not your CEOs,"" said independent senator Angus King. ""If we go through this exercise again we should appreciate seeing the top people.""

"Kontrol Energy hopes its BioCloud devices could be used in hospitals, transport systems and schools - but has no orders as yet. One expert, who independently tested the system, said he believed it worked. But another told the BBC it would need many more tests before he was convinced of its efficacy. The device analyses air quality, samples of which are sent to a detection chamber that can be set up for Covid-specific testing. According to the firm, the devices use ""three independent capture techniques"" that allow for virus sampling, but it does not explain what these are. The firm said it had received interest in the device from ""around the globe"". ""There is a critical need for technology that can provide us with assurances that the workplaces, schools, healthcare environments and other spaces we physically occupy are safe and free of infectious disease,"" said Paul Ghezzi, chief executive of Kontrol. Sceptical Dr David Heinrichs, professor of microbiology and immunology at Western University in Ontario, said his lab had tested the device. ""There's no doubt in my mind that this technology can quickly and effectively detect an array of airborne pathogens, including the virus that causes Covid-19,"" he said. But Prof Alan McNally from Birmingham University was not convinced. ""I think this is just another test being marketed with absolutely no robust, independent validation and testing, and I would say I am extremely sceptical on its use."" He said that it would need ""an incredible amount of independent testing"". He also said it was unclear what the procedure for schools and businesses would be if the alarm sounded: ""How exactly one would act if Covid in the air was detected is rather beyond me."" Kontrol said it would be up to the administrator of the device to decide how to proceed, but it would allow ""outbreaks to be contained"". The firm received a $50,000 (£38,000) grant from the National Research Council of Canada to develop its BioCloud device. Each unit will cost an estimated $12,000 and the firm hopes to be able to manufacture up to 20,000 per month.","A Canadian company has developed a wall-mounted device it claims can detect the presence of coronavirus in the air, and send an alert."
"Microsoft's operating system features a touchscreen interface prompting manufacturers to restyle their laptops. HP, Toshiba, Dell, Asus and Lenovo are among those showing off new products. Efforts are split between models in which keyboards detach from screens, ones in which the keys remain attached but can be hidden behind displays, and traditional fixed clamshell designs. The hybrid tablet/laptop concept had been championed by Intel at the Consumer Electronics Show earlier this year. Apple - which makes the bestselling tablet on the market - later suggested that mixing the different types of computer together risked a situation in which ""you wind up compromising in both and not pleasing either user"". But some analysts say Windows 8 is specifically designed to work in both modes, so the designs may make sense. The operating system has been scheduled for release on 26 October. Magnetic dock Hewlett-Packard, the world's largest tech company by sales, has shown off three new models in San Francisco. Its most portable device - the HP Envy x2 - has opted for a design in which its 11in (27.9cm) screen can attach to a keyboard dock, using magnets to guide both parts into place. The model distinguishes itself from earlier designs by featuring an 8 megapixel camera on the back of the screen allowing it to be used as a camera and the inclusion of NFC (near field communication) technology to allow users to easily share photos, contacts and other content with each other. HP's two other models both feature touchscreens built into a traditional laptop design. By contrast Toshiba's Satellite U925t features a screen that can slide over its keyboard. The computer - which was unveiled at the IFA trade show in Berlin - features a bigger 12.5in (31.8cm) display than has been traditional with this format. Screens that swivel Dell's XPS Duo 12 takes another approach, allowing its screen to pivot around its bezel. Once the user has spun it around the laptop can be closed leaving the display face-up, ready for use. Dell also announced the XPS 10 tablet - which is powered by an ARM-based processor rather than the x86 design used in Intel's products. This will run Windows RT - Microsoft's first PC system to support ARM's chip architecture. Dell's model is paired with a detachable keyboard dock. The idea of using a detachable keyboard had been popularised by Asus' Transformer series of Android computers. The Taiwanese company has now shown off two models running Windows 8 using the Vivo Tab brand: one running Windows RT, and a slightly bigger version running the full system. Twist and flip Lenovo bucked the trend at IFA releasing three laptops with regular screens that do not accept touch input. A spokeswoman for the Chinese firm said it believed there would still be a market for such devices after Window 8 became available. But she highlighted the fact that the firm also planned to formally launch the Ideapad Yoga at a later point. The hybrid PC uses a hinge to swivel its screen around so that it can be flipped up flat against the back of the keyboard, or part-folded so that it can prop itself up on table. ""Windows 8 is a tipping point,"" said David McQueen, principal analyst at the tech consultancy Informa. ""Microsoft has already shown off its Surface design - which looks great with its keyboard that doubles as a cover - and we're now seeing other approaches in which manufacturers are trying to make the machines suitable for both productivity and fun. ""At the moment the firms seems to be throwing lots out and waiting to see what sticks. It will be interesting to see how much product refresh there is - if people buy one model and then want to switch to another design for a different experience, and how quickly they do that.2",PC-makers are showing off a range of new computers aimed at convincing users to upgrade after Windows 8 is released.
"Most rogue extensions bombard people with ads, but the most malicious steal login names and other valuable data. Carried out by security experts and Google, the project analysed more than 100 million visits to the search giant's sites. It led to Google purging almost 200 bad extensions from its online catalogues of browser add-ons. Bad behaviour? Extensions and add-ons for web browsers add all kinds of functions and features to the software. Many of these extensions have hidden extras that cause trouble for people who install them, said UC Santa Barbara computer scientist Alexandros Kapravelos, who worked with Google on the rogue extensions project. The research found that malicious extensions were available for every major browser. The findings are due to be published in full in May at the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy. Preliminary results revealed that 5% of people accessing Google every day have been caught out by at least one malicious extension. Of these victims, about a third have four or more bad add-ons installed in their browser. ""It is a very hard problem to deal with,"" said Mr Kapravelos. Some bad extensions were easy to spot, he said, because they were so obviously written to steal saleable data such as bitcoins, bank logins or personal data. However, many used techniques seen in legitimate extensions, he said, and it took a lot of extra analysis to pin down the bad ones. ""Even when we have a complete understanding of what the extension is doing, sometimes it is not clear if that behaviour is malicious or not,"" he said. ""You would expect that an extension that injects or replaces advertisements is malicious, but then you have AdBlock that creates an ad-free browsing experience and is technically very similar."" Experts from Swedish security firm ScrapeSentry said it had found examples of extensions that gathered data in ways that could easily be abused. ScrapeSentry's analysis of one extension, called Webpage Screenshot, revealed that it contained code that let it grab copies of all the browser traffic from the PC on which it was installed. The gathered data was then sent to a server in the US. The extension has been downloaded about 1.2 million times. ""What happens to the personal data and the motives for sending it to the US server is anyone's guess, but we'd take an educated guess that it's not going to be good news,"" said Martin Zetterlund from ScrapeSentry. A spokesman for Webpage Screenshot said there was nothing malicious about the data it gathered. Instead, said the spokesman, it was used to understand who the extension's users were and where they were located to help drive development of the code. Users could opt out of sharing data, he said. Deleting data Mr Kapravelos said Google had acted on the early findings of the research by removing 192 actively malicious extensions from its Chrome catalogue. About 14 million people had been tricked into using these extensions, he said. The UC Santa Barbara team was working with Google to develop tools that can automatically spot malicious extensions and flag them to the search giant's security staff. In addition, said Mr Kapravelos, firms whose adverts were being injected onto webpages by the rogue extensions had been informed. Unfortunately, he said, ad injection had become ""entrenched"" as a way for some unscrupulous developers to make money. The research found that only a small number of developers were behind the majority of the rogue extensions that pepper people with ads, suggesting that targeted action could help tackle the problem.","Tens of millions of users who visit Google sites use a browser loaded with malicious add-ons, research suggests."
"By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter Teachers shared details on an online forum about suspicious files found on devices sent to a Bradford school. The malware, which they said appeared to be contacting Russian servers, is believed to have been found on laptops given to a handful of schools. The Department for Education said it was aware and urgently investigating. A DfE official told BBC News: ""We are aware of an issue with a small number of devices. And we are investigating as an urgent priority to resolve the matter as soon as possible. ""DfE IT teams are in touch with those who have reported this issue."" ""We believe this is not widespread."" Geo, the firm which made the laptops, told the BBC: ""We have been working closely with the Department for Education regarding a reported issue on a very small number of devices. We are providing our full support during their investigation. ""We take all matters of security extremely seriously. Any schools that have concerns should contact the Department for Education."" According to the forum, the Windows laptops contained Gamarue.I, a worm identified by Microsoft in 2012. The government has so far sent schools more than 800,000 laptops, as it tries to distribute more than a million devices to disadvantaged pupils who may not have access at home. ""Upon unboxing and preparing them, it was discovered that a number of the laptops were infected with a self-propagating network worm,"" wrote Marium Haque, deputy director of Education and Learning at Bradford Council. She recommended that schools also check their networks ""as an added precaution"". Information security consultant Paul Moore told the BBC that the Gamarue worm ""presents a very severe threat to any PC or network"". ""Ideally users should reboot into safe mode and run a full scan with an anti-virus product,"" he said. ""However with this type of malware, it is advisable to seek professional assistance in order to ensure it has been correctly removed."" The malware in question installs spyware which can gather information about browsing habits, as well as harvest personal information such as banking details. ""The fact that these devices were not checked and scrubbed before being sent to vulnerable children is a concern,"" said George Glass, head of threat intelligence at security firm Redscan.","Some of the laptops given out in England to support vulnerable children home-schooling during lockdown contain malware, BBC News has learned."

"In an open letter, it says the comments were ""ill informed and not based on facts"". The letter comes as the Australian government is expected to ban Huawei from bidding in a 5G mobile auction. The ban is prompted by fears that China would have de facto control over the network if Huawei successfully bid. Island link In its public letter, written by Huawei Australia chairman John Lord and board members John Brumby and Lance Hockridge, the company denies allegations that it is under the control of the Chinese government and says it is a private company owned by its ""employees, with no other shareholders"". It says it has offered to build an ""evaluation and testing"" centre in which its 5G equipment could be evaluated by Australian government agencies. And it cites 5G technology deals in the UK, Canada and New Zealand that followed the building of similar testing centres. If Huawei is banned from bidding, it will be the latest in a series of decisions by Australia to limit the company's access to key infrastructure. In 2012, the company was banned from supplying equipment for the country's National Broadband Network. In May this year, Australia spent millions ensuring Huawei had no part in a cable linking the Solomon Islands with the country. Also, the Australian parliament is currently debating a Foreign Interference Bill that would require people to declare if they were working on behalf of a foreign power, largely seen as a way to hobble Beijing's influence. Huawei has also faced restrictions in the US, where it is effectively barred from selling its equipment because of security concerns.",Chinese telecoms company Huawei has sharply criticised Australian government comments about its policies and products.
"The claim relates to items sold via Amazon's ""fulfilment"" scheme, whereby third parties list their goods on the retail giant's site, store their inventory in its warehouses and rely on it for deliveries. Apple warns the alleged fakes are potentially life-threatening. But it is suing one of the vendors rather than Amazon itself. The defendant, New York-based Mobile Star LLC, could not be reached for comment and has yet to file its own legal paperwork. ""Mobile Star has been deceiving Apple customers and putting their safety at risk by selling counterfeit power adapters,"" an Apple spokesman told the BBC.

The roll-out of the product for smartphones, Xbox games consoles and other kit will follow later. One expert said the release could prove critical to the Microsoft's fortunes. Windows 8 - the current iteration - has had a troubled life, with many deciding not to update to its touch-centric user interface. The company has acknowledged the fact by returning some features dropped from the more popular Windows 7. ""We designed Windows 10 to create a new generation of Windows for the 1.5 billion people using Windows today in 190 countries around the world,"" wrote Terry Myerson, Microsoft's vice-president of operating systems, on its blog. ""Familiar, yet better than ever, Windows 10 brings back the Start menu you know and love."" He also highlighted new additions, including: Many company watchers had not expected the launch of the product to happen until later in the year. One analyst said the release was important as it might be ""Microsoft's last chance"" to crack the tablet market before Android and iOS became too entrenched, but added that it was unlikely to drive demand for new equipment in the same way earlier Windows updates had done. ""Microsoft and Intel are certainly pushing the two-in-one device strategy [in which laptops transform into tablets], which could result in some sales,"" said Michael Silver from the tech consultancy Gartner. ""But it's not only the fact that the upgrade is free, but Windows 10 for PCs is designed to run on computers that ran Windows 7 and even do better on less powerful hardware, so it will not spur on sales to the same extent as we've seen in the past.""","Microsoft's next generation of its operating system, Windows 10, is due to be released next month."
"A team of cyber-security experts looked at the security protocols used by the top 500 sites in various industries and online sectors. They found that fewer than 10% of news and sports websites used basic security protocols such as HTTPS and TLS. Even those that do are not always using the ""latest or strongest protocols"", one of the study's authors said. ""As time goes by, all encryption gets weaker because people find ways around it,"" Prof Alan Woodward, a cyber-security expert at the University of Surrey, told the BBC. ""We tested the University of Surrey's website using a site called Security Headers a couple of weeks ago and it got an A,"" he explained, ""but it's only a C now."" Shopping and gaming The research, published in the Journal of Cyber Security Technology, shows that some sectors seem much more security-conscious than others. The websites of computer and technology companies and financial organisations showed a much higher level of adoption than shopping and gaming sites, for example. ""In the financial sector, almost every one of the sites we looked at had encrypted links"", Prof Woodward said, ""but even in retail the adoption of the very latest standards is low."" A quarter of the shopping sites studied were using Transport Layer Security (TLS), which offers tools including digital certificates, remote passwords, and a choice of ciphers to encrypt traffic between a website and its visitors. But among news and sport websites fewer than 8% were found to be using the protocol. Among those that did, many failed to make use of some of the strongest tools available, such as HSTS, which automatically pushes users accessing an unsecured version of a website on to the encrypted version instead. 'Click on the padlock' ""It's like news and sport content providers don't value the security of their content,"" Prof Woodward said. ""They're leaving themselves vulnerable to attacks like cross-site scripting, where an attacker can pretend something's come from a website when it hasn't."" But Prof Woodward warned against putting too much faith in sites that appear to have the most up-to-date and comprehensive security protocols in place. ""People assume that because they're using TLS they're having a secure conversation, but there's no guarantee about who they're having that secure conversation with,"" he explained. ""Some of those spoof sites are using more up-to-date security than the genuine sites. You've got to click on that padlock and check who it is you're talking to.""","News and sports websites have some of the lowest levels of security adoption, a study has suggested."
"By Paul RubensTechnology reporter But when the Olympic opening ceremony starts on 27 July, data will flash through them as they transmit the highest definition pictures Olympic coverage has ever seen. Technology has come a long way since the last Olympics in London in 1948, broadcast in black and white. The cables will carry ultra-high definition video, which at a resolution of 7680x4320 is an astonishing 16 times the quality of HD television. The video technology was developed and supplied by Japanese broadcaster NHK, and is known as Super Hi-Vision. It will be sent to the world's first ultra-high definition production centre at the BBC, and then over high-speed data networks to four giant screens around Britain, two in Japan and one in the United States. ""When you see this type of ultra-high definition television, it's just like looking though a glass window,"" said Tim Plyming, the BBC's Super Hi-Vision project leader. ""This is the highest definition that the human eye can understand - it's the end of the story in terms of resolution."" Going 3D But with only a handful of screens around the world capable of displaying ultra-high definition pictures, an estimated 4.8 billion sports fans will be turning to their televisions, computers, or mobile devices to catch the Olympic action. London 2012 will be the first Olympics to feature live 3D television broadcasts, and 33 ""true 3D"" cameras will be used to capture more than 230 hours of 3D coverage. The BBC will broadcast the opening and closing ceremonies and the men's 100m final in 3D, and pan-European broadcaster Eurosport will also be providing 3D coverage. The BBC will broadcast more than 2,500 hours (equivalent to almost four months) of high definition television over the 17-day period, covering every sport, from every venue, on every day. To squeeze it all in, the corporation will use 24 Olympic channels, which will be available via the BBC Red Button or channel numbers in the electronic programme guides on cable and satellite services. The same 24 television channels will also be available as 24 high definition online streams, tailored for viewing on connected TVs, PCs, tablets and mobile phones, and the BBC expects online viewing figures will be the highest ever. ""For moments involving British athletes, or major games moments, we have planned for a doubling of streaming capacity over the highest we have ever needed before,"" says Phil Fearnley, BBC Future Media's general manager. The BBC has recently introduced a new video delivery technology called ""chunked streaming "" which makes it possible for a viewer joining halfway through an event to ""rewind"" the stream back to the start. This technology will feature in the BBC's new Live Interactive Video Player, which is being introduced specially for the Olympics on its website. It allows visitors to switch between the 24 live streams instantly, rewind to earlier parts of the action, receive alerts about big moments on other channels (""Tom Daley is diving now!""), and access real-time statistics and information about individual athletes or events. ""This is a knockout piece of technology,"" says Mr Fearnley. Mobile experience For mobile users, a mobile site will mirror much of the desktop experience, adapted to the size of their device's screen. Apple and Android users will also be able to access the 24 live video streams and highlights. BBC Olympics apps for Apple and Android smartphones will include all the features available on the mobile browser site, plus the ability to read content even when disconnected from the internet. There is also a BBC Sport app for Virgin Media's TiVo service, Sony, Panasonic and Samsung internet-connected televisions and Sony's PlayStation games console, which allows viewers to watch online streams, on demand highlights and news headlines on their TVs. Around the globe The BBC's streams are only available in the United Kingdom, but viewers elsewhere in the world will be turning to other sources of online coverage. In the US, NBC will be adding to its broadcast and cable television coverage with streamed content delivered using technology provided by YouTube, and the International Olympic Committee plans to provide a live stream to sports fans in 64 countries across Africa and Asia using its own dedicated YouTube channel. No Olympics would be complete without photographic imagery - and Getty Images, the official photographic agency, expects to shoot more than one million pictures during the games. These will include 3D images - an Olympic first - and high resolution 360 degree panoramic photographs. Some of London's Olympic venues, including Wembley and Excel, do not provide photographers with ideal vantage points, according to Getty Images' Ken Mainardis. To get around this problem, Getty is pioneering the use of robotic cameras installed in the roofs of these buildings. Photographers up to 200m away can see each camera's view on a laptop screen, adjust the camera settings using software running on a laptop, and move the camera and take photographs using a joystick. Back in 1948, it took hours just to get photographs developed, but Mr Mainardis says fibre optic networks allow the best Olympic pictures to be made available across the globe in minutes. ""From the moment an athlete crosses a finishing line, a photograph will arrive at a newspaper as far away as Australia in about 180 seconds,"" he says.","Somewhere beneath the streets of London, four miles of fibre optic cables linking the Olympic Park to the BBC's Television Centre lie in darkness."
"Users will be able to limit what they see from certain types of account, particularly ones with no profile picture or information. Such accounts are often set up by trolls. The company said it would act only on accounts that its computer algorithms had thrown up as being abusive. ""Since these tools are new, we will sometimes make mistakes, but know that we are actively working to improve and iterate on them every day,"" said Ed Ho, Twitter's vice-president of engineering in a blogpost. The updates are the latest in a series of changes Twitter has implemented in recent months. In February, it said it would make it harder for abusive users to create new accounts, as well as launching a safe search function and collapsing tweet replies deemed abusive so they are hidden from immediate view. There has been mounting pressure on social media firms to deal with the growth of extremist propaganda, fake news and harassment on their platforms. Mr Ho added: ""We're working to identify accounts as they're engaging in abusive behaviour, even if this behaviour hasn't been reported to us. ""Then we're taking action by limiting certain account functionality for a set amount of time, such as allowing only their followers to see their tweets."" Nick Thomas, an analyst at research firm Ovum, said: ""Given that cleaning up Twitter is imperative if it is to attract more advertisers to the site, there is pressure not just to act, but to be seen to act - which may explain why they are making multiple announcements.""",Twitter has introduced more measures aimed at cutting down on the amount of abuse on the platform.
"By Cody GodwinBBC News, San Francisco Consumer Reports engineers looked into claims that Autopilot can operate without a driver present. They tested the Model Y on a closed track and concluded the system could be ""easily tricked"". It comes days after a fatal Tesla crash in Texas. Police believe no one was in the driver's seat. Tesla's Autopilot is an advanced driver assistance system that Tesla says ""enhances safety and convenience behind the wheel"". 'Clearly insufficient' The Consumer Reports team said they successfully - and repeatedly - tricked the car into driving their test track with no one in the driver's seat. ""In our evaluation, the system not only failed to make sure the driver was paying attention, but it also couldn't tell if there was a driver there at all,"" said Consumer Reports auto testing director Jake Fisher. ""It was a bit frightening when we realized how easy it was to defeat the safeguards, which we proved were clearly insufficient."" Tesla's website says the Autopilot system requires a ""fully attentive driver"" and using the system does not make the car autonomous. Some of the safety requirements for Autopilot mode include: keeping the driver's hands on the steering wheel, buckling the seatbelt and not opening any doors. Crash investigations On Saturday, two men were killed after a Tesla car crashed into a tree and caught fire in Texas. The victims were found in the front passenger seat and in the back seat of the vehicle, leading police to believe nobody was in the driver's seat. However, Tesla boss Elon Musk said that ""data logs recovered so far show Autopilot was not enabled"". ""Moreover, standard Autopilot would require lane lines to turn on, which this street did not have,"" Mr Musk tweeted. On Thursday, two Democratic Senators sent a letter to the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) asking them to investigate the fatal Tesla accident in Texas. Senator Blumenthal and Senator Markey also requested a report outlining ways to prevent future accidents. The NHTSA has opened investigations into 28 crashes involving Tesla vehicles. Tesla has not responded to the BBC's request for comment.

"Several new computers have been found carrying malware installed in the factory, suggests a Microsoft study. One virus called Nitol found by Microsoft steals personal details to help criminals plunder online bank accounts. Microsoft won permission from a US court to tackle the network of hijacked PCs made from Nitol-infected computers. Domain game In a report detailing its work to disrupt the Nitol botnet, Microsoft said the criminals behind the malicious program had exploited insecure supply chains to get viruses installed as PCs were being built. The viruses were discovered when Microsoft digital crime investigators bought 20 PCs, 10 desktops and 10 laptops from different cities in China. Four of the computers were infected with malicious programs even though they were fresh from the factory. Microsoft set up and ran Operation b70 to investigate and found that the four viruses were included in counterfeit software some Chinese PC makers were installing on computers. Nitol was the most pernicious of the viruses Microsoft caught because, as soon as the computer was turned on, it tried to contact the command and control system set up by Nitol's makers to steal data from infected machines. Further investigation revealed that the botnet behind Nitol was being run from a web domain that had been involved in cybercrime since 2008. Also on that domain were 70,000 separate sub-domains used by 500 separate strains of malware to fool victims or steal data. ""We found malware capable of remotely turning on an infected computer's microphone and video camera, potentially giving a cybercriminal eyes and ears into a victim's home or business,"" said Richard Boscovich, a lawyer in Microsoft's digital crimes unit in a blogpost. A US court has now given Microsoft permission to seize control of the web domain, 3322.org, which it claims is involved with the Nitol infections. This will allow it to filter out legitimate data and block traffic stolen by the viruses. Peng Yong, the Chinese owner of the 3322.org domain, told the AP news agency that he knew nothing about Microsoft's legal action and said his company had a ""zero tolerance"" attitude towards illegal activity on the domain. ""Our policy unequivocally opposes the use of any of our domain names for malicious purposes,"" Peng told AP. However, he added, the sheer number of users it had to police meant it could not be sure that all activity was legitimate. ""We currently have 2.85 million domain names and cannot exclude that individual users might be using domain names for malicious purposes,"" he said.",Cybercriminals have opened a new front in their battle to infect computers with malware - PC production lines.
"The title was formerly held by the Amstrad PCW which is believed to have sold a total of eight million units. Sales of the Raspberry Pi will surpass that figure this month, said the Raspberry Pi project founder Eben Upton. The milestone comes as the Raspberry Pi 3 is unveiled featuring a faster 64-bit processor and built-in wi-fi and Bluetooth connections. ""We're calling it,"" said Mr Upton. ""We're the best-selling UK computer ever."" He said the Pi Foundation initially thought it had won the title last year when sales blew past the total set by Sinclair machines in the 1980s. However, he said, it then emerged that the Amstrad machine had sold in larger numbers. Now, even that total has been exceeded. Popular choice ""The curve keeps trending upwards,"" said Mr Upton, adding that sales will get a fillip from the release of the Raspberry Pi 3 on 29 February. It will go on sale for $35 (£30) and a ""few hundred thousand units"" will be available on launch day from online stores. ""The two main things that people do with their Pi are use it as a PC replacement or use it as an embedded computer,"" Mr Upton told the BBC. ""The Pi 3 is doubling down on both those things rather than going looking for new things to do."" The updated device has a 64-bit processor onboard that gives the Pi 3 a 50% performance improvement on the Pi 2. Also built in to the new device are wi-fi and Bluetooth connections. Hobbyists using the Pi to act as a hub for smart home gadgets would be able to use Bluetooth to link devices and sensors together, he said. ""This is the first Pi you can stick behind your TV and completely forget about,"" said Mr Upton. There were also signs that the Pi was succeeding in achieving one of its founding aims - to make computer science a more popular option at degree level. Mr Upton said that the Pi's popularity and other coding projects were boosting interest in the technical subject. In some institutions, the numbers of people enrolling on computer science courses had recovered from the low points seen in 2008-9, he said. However, he admitted it could still be be ""too early"" to see the full effect of the Pi on people who wished to pursue coding or their technical skills, given that the first Pi was only released in 2012. The gadget was starting to be used widely in schools, and the Pi Foundation's merger with the Code Club initiative would make sure it reached more children, he said. ""With 9-11 year-olds, we are seeing a lot of people get excited about it at that level,"" said Mr Upton.",The Raspberry Pi has become the most popular British computer yet made.
"Mr Icke has made several false claims about coronavirus, such as suggesting 5G mobile phone networks are linked to the spread of the virus. In one video, he suggested a Jewish group was behind the virus. Following the ban, his Twitter account posted: ""Fascist Facebook deletes David Icke - the elite are TERRIFIED."" Facebook said in a statement: ""We have removed this Page for repeatedly violating our policies on harmful misinformation''. Campaign On Friday, campaign group the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) published an open letter calling on tech companies to ban Mr Icke's accounts. The letter said Amazon, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube had amplified ""Icke's racism and misinformation about Covid-19 to millions of people"". It was co-signed by MP Damian Collins, as well as celebrity medics Dr Christian Jessen, Dr Dawn Harper and Dr Pixie McKenna. The CCDH said videos of Mr Icke making ""untrue and conspiracist claims about Covid-19"" had been watched more than 30 million times online. As examples, it cited: The letter was published after Facebook had removed Mr Icke's page. In April, YouTube removed an interview with Mr Icke in which he said there ""is a link between 5G and this health crisis"". When asked for his reaction to reports of 5G masts being set on fire in England and Northern Ireland, he responded: ""If 5G continues and reaches where they want to take it, human life as we know it is over... so people have to make a decision."" Facebook later removed the same video saying it broke its rules on misinformation. Later, the telecoms regulator Ofcom found local TV channel London Live in breach of standards for an interview it aired with Mr Icke about coronavirus. Analysis By Marianna Spring, Specialist disinformation and social media reporter David Icke has promoted several conspiracy theories on social media throughout the pandemic - and has consequently found himself in hot water with social media sites and broadcasting regulators. The health misinformation that he's been spreading, including linking 5G to coronavirus, has played a role in platforms like YouTube tightening their policies about conspiracy theories. This is a difficult area for social media sites to tackle. Medical myths and speculation that could cause harm are easier to act on, while conspiracy theories occupy a grey area where companies risk accusations of censorship if they take action. But the setting alight of mobile phone towers and abuse of telecommunications workers linked to this 5G coronavirus conspiracy has pushed sites like Twitter and TikTok to tighten their rules. Facebook has also recognised that the conspiracy theories repeatedly promoted by Icke fall into their bracket of harmful misinformation. This isn't the first time it has removed content from him - but the platform has gone one step further in taking down his page. Governments and social media sites alike grapple with the fine balance between stemming harmful narratives and allowing freedom of expression. But experts point out that they can do both with effective moderation and collaboration.","Facebook has taken down the official page of conspiracy theorist David Icke for publishing ""health misinformation that could cause physical harm""."
"By Alex HudsonBBC News The launch of Mega was meant to be founder Kim Dotcom's big return. Dotcom - originally called Kim Schmitz - is still awaiting a hearing relating to criminal charges, in part, about the ""massive scale"" of copyright infringement and pirated material on his original site Megaupload - charges he denies. Megaupload became one of the most popular websites on the web before it was shut down but Mega is meant to be bigger, better and - most importantly - legally watertight. The new site allows 50GB of free storage upon sign-up - more than twice the amount if the user is signed up for free accounts with Google, Apple, Microsoft and Dropbox put together. It is a site advertised as being a place where lots of files can be stored securely and accessed by the user, from any computer. The content is encrypted, so even staff at Mega need the user's key to unlock it. But the key can be shared and the files might not just be family photos or a home recording. And this is where infringing copyright could, once again, become a problem. Anti-piracy stance ""The encryption protects Kim Dotcom. It doesn't protect the end user,"" says Andrew Orlowski, columnist at The Register. ""Although unless you live in France or Korea, it's frankly unlikely that someone will come knocking on your door if you do use the service to upload copyrighted content."" Piracy is a problem for a number of industries. Richard Atkinson, head of software company Adobe's piracy unit, said that 55 million ""illegal activations"" of pirated versions of the photo-editing software had occurred in the last year. And the film industry has been among the loudest of critics. Hollywood loses close to $20.5bn (£13bn) to movie piracy in a year, according to a report published by the US Institute for Policy Innovation. Hollywood revenues in North America for 2012 were reported at $10.8bn (£6.8bn), the highest total figure ever. The difficulty detecting piracy is, of course, keeping on top of everything being uploaded. Mega said more than one million people used the site in its first day. Dotcom says his new enterprise is already in the top 150 ""most visited"" sites in the world. A number of other sites which take an anti-piracy stance often link to content hosted by Mega - content they believe has been placed there illegally. However, Dotcom firmly believes his site is sticking to the rules. ""Mega is now hosting almost 50 million files,"" he he tweeted on 31 January. ""Only 0.001% have been taken down by content owners. MASSIVE non-infringing use!"" When searching for content hosted by Mega - via a third-party site not endorsed by Mega itself - in two minutes the BBC found full versions of the films Django Unchained, The Hobbit, Skyfall and The Dark Knight Rises. But as Mega has said from the outset, reported content is taken down. This happened to all four of these examples. ""Copyright takedown notices per day: Google 450,000 vs Mega 50,"" Dotcom tweeted separately. The search engine itself - because of a code ""developed by Mega to delete all files indexed on Mega-Search"" - became unusable. This included some content uploaded there that was not infringing copyright. Despite all this attention on Mega and its activities, films under copyright are not difficult to come by elsewhere. ""It's pretty much impossible to prevent this happening, from your site being used for these illegal purposes as well,"" says Ernesto Van Der Sar, the name used by editor-in-chief of file-sharing news site TorrentFreak. ""There's also Dropbox and Google Drive and they're also hosting content that's not so legal. That's also searchable on Google if you know how to look for it. ""Mega are being watched so they're trying to be proactive about it. There are search engines for Dropbox, pretty similar to the ones used on Mega, it's not unique."" This content is not placed there by the hosting companies, but is made available by users. And this appears to be true, even on major search engines. Moles and mallets After typing in ""stream Skyfall"", the top free result provided more than 80 links to watch the content for free. About 50% of the top links provided a fully-working stream of the film. There are a growing number of people who think that it is nearly, if not entirely, impossible to beat web piracy. ""Stopping online piracy is like playing the world's largest game of Whac-A-Mole,"" journalist Nick Bilton wrote in the New York Times. ""Hit one, countless others appear. Quickly. And the mallet is heavy and slow."" A ""six-strikes"" scheme, believed to be launching in the US in the coming weeks, is hoped to stem the tide of illegal content on the web. Agreed by most major internet service providers, final details of the scheme are still to be confirmed but it will enforce a Copyright Alert System to warn those people sharing copyrighted content using BitTorrent sites - a method of obtaining files by downloading from many users at the same time - to stop. The way it is expected to work is that five or six warnings are given to users, who will be made to watch a video about the consequences of online piracy, before having their internet speeds lowered. This scheme will not initially affect piracy seen on file-hosting sites like Mega, so questions about its success will remain long after its launch. The film industry is certainly worried about the amount of pirates still taking to the stormy Hollywood seas. But if the pirates cannot be beaten, have media companies still got time to seize an opportunity? ""They should look at how they can give consumers what they want for a fair price,"" says Van Der Sar. ""It's already happening but that's the only way to do it - make it more convenient than the pirated alternative. ""Five years ago, you didn't have Netflix, it was hard to stream movies online, Spotify for music... but Dotcom is right. The big media companies blame piracy for everything. ""Maybe they should spend their time on being even more innovative.""","File-hosting site Mega has faced intense criticism about the sort of files it has been storing in the cloud, but the sharing of copyrighted content illegally is a problem far more widespread."
"By Nicholas TufnellTechnology reporter The firm, called Avast, used publicly available forensic security tools to extract the images from second-hand phones bought on eBay. Other data extracted included emails, text messages and Google searches. Experts have warned that the only way to completely delete data is to ""destroy your phone"". Most smartphones come with a ""factory reset"" option, which is designed to wipe and reset the device, returning it to its original system state. However, Avast has discovered that some older smartphones only erase the indexing of the data and not the data itself, which means pictures, emails and text messages can be recovered relatively easily by using standard forensic tools that anyone can buy and download. The company claims that of 40,000 stored photos extracted from 20 phones purchased from eBay, more than 750 were of women in various stages of undress, along with 250 selfies of ""what appears to be the previous owner's manhood"". There was an additional 1,500 family photos of children, 1,000 Google searches, 750 emails and text messages and 250 contact names and email addresses. The company said: ""Deleting files from your Android phone before selling it or giving it away is not enough. You need to overwrite your files, making them irretrievable."" It was not made clear by Avast whether they extracted data from all 20 phones. Destroy the phone Google responded that Avast used outdated smartphones and that their research did not ""reflect the security protections in Android versions that are used by the vast majority of users"". It was recommended by Google that all users enable encryption on their devices before applying a factory reset to ensure files cannot be accessed. This feature, said Google, has been available for three years, although it is not enabled by default, which could leave less tech-savvy users open to attack. Apple has had built-in encryption for its hardware and firmware since the release of the iPhone 3GS. The hardware encryption is permanently enabled and users cannot turn it off. Additional file data protection is available, but must be turned on in the settings menu. Independent computer security analyst Graham Cluley said that if a user is serious about privacy and security they should make sure their device is always ""protected with a PIN or passphrase, and that the data on it is encrypted"". However, Alan Calder, founder of cybersecurity and risk management firm IT Governance, told the BBC that erasing data, even after it has been encrypted, will not be enough to completely protect your device. ""Google's recommended routine for protecting the data only makes it harder for someone to recover the data - it does not make it impossible,"" he said. ""If you don't want your data recovered, destroy the phone - and that has been standard security advice, in relation to telephones and computer drives, for a number of years. Any other 'solution' simply postpones the point at which someone is able to access your confidential data.""","Thousands of pictures including ""naked selfies"" have been extracted from factory-wiped phones by a Czech Republic-based security firm."
"The rollout of ultra-fast 5G mobile connectivity has sparked some fears the new transmission masts could be dangerous to humans. But Ofcom, the UK regulator, found no identifiable risks in its first tests since 5G technology was deployed. The highest result they found for the 5G band was 0.039% of the recommended exposure limit. Those limits are set by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) - non-ionizing meaning the type that does not damage DNA and cells. ""The emissions at each site were a tiny fraction of the maximum levels set out in international guidelines,"" an Ofcom spokesman said. The tests covered 16 locations in 10 cities across the UK where 5G-enabled mobile base stations had been set up, and measured the strength of the electromagnetic field (EMF). Put the term ""5G"" into Facebook's search box and you can rapidly disappear down a rabbit hole. Take a group called Working Together to Keep Devon 5G Free - the first post is a YouTube video advancing the theory the coronavirus originated in Wuhan because the Chinese city had rolled out 5G. Another post talks of pressurising a school to shut down its wi-fi network - those campaigning against 5G have often expressed similar fears about previous technologies. And the campaigns are having some effect - a number of local councils in the south-west of England have voted to ""ban 5G"", although it is not clear they have the power to stop the rollout. The councils and campaigners have been calling for evidence 5G is safe. Now, Ofcom has provided some. But it seems unlikely the scare stories will just fade away. The highest EMF emissions for 5G were recorded in Birmingham's Mailbox development. By contrast, the highest strength for all mobile bands was in London's Canary Wharf, at 1.5% the safe limit - but a zero 5G measurement. Is there a health risk? Ofcom has been measuring EMF emissions from mobile phone towers since 2003. But all four major UK networks have launched 5G in the past year, prompting Ofcom to test that band. It said the rollout of 5G had seen a renewal of interest in the possible health effects of radio waves and it was receiving an ""increasing number of queries"" about 5G. ""Clearly, the deployment of 5G networks and the take-up of 5G services is at an early stage,"" it said in the technical report outlining its findings. ""We will therefore continue to undertake EMF measurements to monitor the overall trends in the long term."" Despite the public concern, health authorities have consistently declared 5G safe for use. Public Health England acknowledges adding 5G to the existing technologies used could cause ""a small increase in overall exposure to radio waves"". ""However, the overall exposure is expected to remain low relative to guidelines and, as such, there should be no consequences for public health,"" it says in its official guidance. The World Health Organization, meanwhile, classified radio frequency radiation as a ""possible carcinogenic"". That puts it in the same category as pickled vegetables or talcum powder but not as dangerous as alcohol or processed meat.","The first UK safety tests of 5G base stations has found radiation levels are at ""tiny fractions"" of safe limits."
"By Katia MoskvitchTechnology reporter, BBC News The message itself took a fraction of a second to post on the social network. But the media team at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Lab - who wrote it - had had to wait about a quarter of an hour for the signal sent by the vehicle confirming its touchdown to travel from the Red Planet to Earth via radio waves. The time delay is a result of the fact that data cannot be sent back faster than the speed of light - real-time interplanetary conversations are the stuff of science-fiction fantasy. However, efforts are underway to send more data at once by increasing the bandwidth available - to one day stream high-definition (HD) video from the surface of the planet. While Curiosity was able to send back a small black-and-white image of its surroundings within a couple of minutes of its touchdown alert, Nasa's technology is still some way off from being able to provide a high-definition video stream of its activities. But if efforts to switch from radio to laser-based systems bear fruit, future missions might not be bound by the same restriction. Across space Radio waves have a lower frequency than visible light, but belong to the same electromagnetic spectrum and can travel through space at the same speed: 300,000km per second (186,000 miles per second). To send the rover daily instructions, Nasa uses direct-to-Earth transmissions, contacting Curiosity via the X-band segment of the radio region of the electromagnetic spectrum, portions of which are reserved for deep-space communications. A different radio system is in play to beam full-colour photos back to JPL. ""The images are stored digitally on Curiosity's computer, [and then sent to] one of two Mars orbiters - Mars Odyssey and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) - that fly overhead in the mid- to late afternoon on Mars,"" explains Rob Manning, Curiosity project's chief engineer at JPL. There is also a third, European, orbiter, called Mars Express, but it is usually used as a back-up for Nasa missions. Once an orbiter receives the data, it beams it to large dish-shaped antennas of the Deep Space Network (DSN). There are three DSN stations around Earth - in Spain, Australia and California - and the data gets picked up by the antenna that is more ""in line"" with the orbiter sending it. Odyssey sends the information at 256Kbps (kilobits per second) - much slower than MRO's rate of 2Mbps (megabits per second) at closest range which is comparable to the average broadband speed on Earth. The signal has to travel millions of kilometres across space. The distance between Earth and Mars changes constantly because the two planets travel around the Sun at different speeds, and the average distance between them is 225 million km (140 million miles). But at the shortest distance between the planets, it takes less than half an hour for the signal to get picked up by one of the DSN stations, says Mr Manning. The information is then forwarded to Nasa. The fastest time it takes for a high-resolution, colour image to arrive at Nasa from the moment it is snapped by the rover is about 30 minutes - but it may take up to several hours, he adds. Light detectors In the future it could become possible to send more data at a time between planets - and maybe even stream HD video. Scientists at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and JPL have been developing detectors able to sense laser signals in the infrared part of the optical spectrum - all the way down to the smallest unit of light, a photon. Optical signals have a much shorter wavelength than radio frequency signals, which means much higher data rates. A single photon-counting detector translates the arrival of a single photon into an electrical pulse, which is then processed to retrieve data. ""Optical communication for interplanetary missions will become operational next decade,"" says Stephen Townes, the manager of the communication technologies and standards office at JPL. ""It will not replace radio frequency communication anytime soon but will be an enhancement to our communication capabilities. ""We can get 10 times improvement in data rate by switching to optical. ""Nasa has plans for an operational 1Gbps (gigabit per second) optical capability from Mars orbiters at a nominal distance of 150 million km (93 million miles) in the next decade."" The US space agency aims to test the detectors in 2013, during the Lunar Laser Communication Demonstration experiment. The technology will try to transfer data from the Moon to the Earth at a rate of 622Mbps - much faster than average broadband speed, but still slower than the fastest Earth networks that send data at speeds of 20Gbps and above. For Mars, the detectors could increase the data transfer rate to 250Mbps by about 2018, says Mr Townes. And if the next-generation rovers are set up to stream video, maybe one day viewers on Earth will get a much better sensation of what it is like to move around on the Red Planet.","""It once was a small step... now it's six big wheels,"" exclaimed Curiosity's Twitter account after the Nasa rover landed on Mars in early August."
"The Antarctica imagery is so far limited, showing panoramas of the coast and penguins of Half Moon Island. Google says its service now covers 25 nations on all the world's continents. Street View has expanded massively since its launch in 2007 but has encountered a number of protests over its data collection. Wi-fi concerns Brian McClendon, vice-president of Engineering, Google Earth and Maps, announced the extension to Antarctica - and also to Brazil and Ireland - on Google Blog. Google Street View's images are normally taken from a fleet of adapted cars but the Antarctica shots are a combination of Google and user photographs. The Half Moon Island shots are a view of penguins and one of the landscape. ""The blue dots you see throughout the continent when dragging the pegman are user-contributed photos,"" Mr McClendon said. He added: ""We often consider Street View to be the last zoom layer on the map. And a way to show you what a place looks like as if you were there in person, whether you're checking out a coffee shop across town or planning a vacation across the globe. ""You can now see images from around the world spanning from the beaches of Brazil, to the moors of Ireland, to the icy terrain in Antarctica."" Google Street View was launched in May 2007, covering San Francisco, Las Vegas, Denver, New York and Miami, allowing users to navigate virtual streets from photographs gathered from directional cameras on special vehicles. The service has been hugely successful but has brought problems of privacy in some countries. In May, Google admitted that for the past three years it had wrongly collected information people had sent over unencrypted wi-fi networks. The issue came to light after German authorities asked to audit the data the company's Street View cars gathered. It emerged the wi-fi data collection had occurred in more than 30 countries. Investigations are ongoing in France, Germany and Australia, while in Spain, the firm has been summoned to appear before a judge on 4 October. This month, the office for personal data protection in the Czech Republic refused to grant Google a licence to collect fresh data in the country.","Privacy concerns for Google's Street View may now extend to penguins, following the service's extension to a seventh continent - Antarctica."
"Experts see the decision as an acknowledgement that the company cannot compete with market leader Google. It will mean the closure of engineering offices and the loss of jobs in the US and China. Ask has been through a series of rebrandings in recent years, dropping its ""Jeeves"" character only to reinstate it later in the UK. Despite its efforts, Ask.com commands just 3.7% of the search market in the US - a low market share that has led it to reassess its future. ""Why make the huge capital investment required to support algorithmic web search development when independent web search is not required by our strategy?"" the firm said in a statement. ""This doesn't mean however that we have given up on web search. On the contrary, web search was and will continue to be a crucial ingredient to our Q&A offering, but will be provided via third party feeds."" Bing opportunity? Mike Davis, a senior analyst at research firm Ovum, said it was a sensible move. ""Ask started off as a query engine and then moved into web search but it was always pushing against the big boys,"" he said. ""Others don't stand a chance unless they can come up with something completely different so it makes sense for Ask to concentrate on what it is good at - which is answering questions,"" he said. Ask has not said who will power its search but Mr Davis thinks it could be Google's biggest rival. ""Microsoft is making some very good deals at the moment, licensing Bing to other people. It has invested a fortune in search and wants to start knocking at Google's 65% market share,"" he said. Currently Bing commands around 11% of the search market.",Ask.com is abandoning its search technology to concentrate on answering questions using third-party engines.
"The technology, made by a firm called Command Sight, is managed by the US Army Research Laboratory. Military dogs can scout ahead for explosives and other hazards, but need instructions. The goggles are designed to let their handlers direct them, safely out of harm's way. In current combat deployments, soldiers usually direct their animals with hand signals or laser pointers - both of which require the handler to be close by. But that need not be the case if the prototype AR goggles are widely adopted, the army said. Inside the goggles, the dogs can see a visual indicator that they can be trained to follow, directing them to a specific spot. The handler, meanwhile, can see what the dog sees through a remote video feed. ""AR will be used to provide dogs with commands and cues; it's not for the dog to interact with it like a human does,"" said Dr Stephen Lee, a senior scientist with the Army Research Laboratory (ARL). He explained that augmented reality works differently for dogs than for humans, adding: ""The military working dog community is very excited about the potential of this technology."" Each set of goggles is specially fit for each dog, with a visual indictor that allows the dog to be directed to a specific spot and react to the visual cue in the goggles. The goggles themselves are not new - military dogs are already used to wearing them as protection in bad conditions or for aerial drops, but the augmented reality system is a new development. Command Sight's founder Dr AJ Peper said the project was still in its ""beginning research stages"", but that early results were ""extremely promising"". A lot of the research had been done with his own dog - a Rottweiler named Mater. Justin Bronk, research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) defence think tank, told the BBC that although the idea might sound like an ""extravagant expense"", it could still be useful. ""An ability to direct dogs with visual cues through augmented reality goggles without having to maintain close physical proximity has obvious tactical benefits in a variety of situations,"" he said. Command Sight has been given more funding to make a wireless version of the product, which should be far more practical than the initial, leashed version.","The US Army has shown off augmented reality goggles for combat dogs, designed to let them receive orders at a distance."
"By Kevin RawlinsonTechnology Reporter Developers have had to censor the game to comply with German laws banning the use of Nazi imagery. The publishers said that, as in previous instalments, the PC version of the game would be geo-locked to exclude players in Germany. The publishers are not thought to have placed similar restrictions on the versions for other platforms. Pete Hines, the head of PR for Wolfenstein publisher Bethesda Softworks, confirmed Tuesday's release of the New Order was the first time a Wolfenstein game was being sold in Germany. He said: ""In Germany, we've removed all Nazi symbols and references. Unlike films and other works of art, video games in Germany are forbidden to use such symbols and references as they are classified in Germany as toys and not media art."" The illegal display of Nazi imagery is punishable by three years in prison in Germany. The game is also being censored in Austria. Highly sensitive The series, which has been running since 1981, is highly sensitive in Germany because it features imagery that clearly evokes Adolf Hitler's regime. The version released on 20 May is set in 1960 and imagines that the Nazi leadership were victorious over the Allied forces in World War Two. The player takes the role of an American war hero who leads a counter-offensive. Speaking last month, Mr Hines revealed the censorship of the German version, saying: ""They have a thing about Nazis there."" In an interview on gaming website Gamespot he said Germany was ""a little touchy"" about Nazi-linked imagery, adding: ""And so [the Nazis] are called The Regime in Wolfenstein in Germany... it's completely stripped of all the constitutionally banned content."" The developers faced questions from fans who were surprised that the latest instalment has no multiplayer feature. Asked why, Mr Hines said: ""For a lot of other publishers, that would probably be a trickier question to answer, but Bethesda stands defiantly in support of single-player stuff. ""Fallout 3, Skyrim, Dishonored, Evil Within, Wolfenstein, we believe that if multiplayer fits and it's part of what you're trying to create, you should absolutely do it. But, if it's not, for God's sake leave it out. Stop shoehorning into stuff that has no business being there."" He added that the latest version of the game would be a departure from the ""mysticism"" that was prevalent in the previous game. Speaking to a live audience on the Gamespot website, Mr Hines compared the Wolfenstein series to the Batman films, saying that the ""grittier"" New Order instalment was the ""Dark Knight reboot of Wolfenstein"".","The cult game Wolfenstein, in which players battle a Nazi regime, has been released in Germany for the first time."
"The advert mimicked a horror film and showed young people being menaced by a scary doll when they played a particular song. In its ruling, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said the setting and events were ""particularly likely"" to scare younger viewers. Spotify has been told to make sure its future adverts are fit for children to watch and are targeted appropriately. In a statement, Spotify said: ""We acknowledge the ruling from the ASA and regret any distress the ad may have caused the complainant."" The ASA has also banned an ad for breast enlargement which was shown during ITV's Love Island. Implied violence The Spotify advert ran on YouTube in June 2018 and featured several scenes of young people regularly playing the song Havana by Camila Cabello. The video shows the music also waking a ""horror film style doll"" that then pops up and scares the characters every time the track is played. The ad generated a complaint that it: And the ASA upheld both of these complaints ""in part"". The implied violence in the clip, its music, the reactions of the characters and the abrupt ways the doll appeared all served to make it likely to scare children, said the ASA. ""The fact that the ad was set inside a home, including a bedtime setting, and featured a doll, meant it was particularly likely to cause distress to children who saw it,"" it said in its ruling. Not enough had been done to make it clear that the advert was not a trailer for a horror movie, it said. The ASA said that the advert had been scheduled to run before content connected with a video game suitable for players aged 10 or above. And, it said, the channel it had appeared on was designed to attract a younger audience. Spotify defended itself by saying that although the advert had some horror-film-style scenes, there was no gore or violence. The soundtrack helped establish it was intended to be ""tongue-in-cheek"". And the on-screen text used to close the ad - ""Killer songs you can't resist"" - helped reinforce its intent to make a spoof rather than a clip that was genuinely scary. In addition, it said, 73% of the audience for the channel the ad appeared on was aged between 18 and 44. After the ruling, it said: ""We take our responsibilities as a marketer very seriously and continue to be mindful of the ASA's guidance on the effective and appropriate targeting of advertising campaigns.""","A Spotify ad has been banned for ""unjustifiably"" distressing children."
"The changes allowed blocked users to continue to see tweets and interact with accounts that had blocked them, leading to an outcry. Twitter said it was reverting to old rules, under which users are not able to follow an account once blocked. Blocking is used by people to stop trolls and rude online commentators from interacting with them. ""We have decided to revert the change after receiving feedback from many users - we never want to introduce features at the cost of users feeling less safe,"" Michael Sippey, Twitter's vice-president of product, said in a blogpost. ""Any blocks you had previously instituted are still in effect."" 'Post-blocking retaliation' There have been calls for Twitter to do more to counter cyberbullying following a number of high-profile cases of trolling, where users of the social networking site were bombarded with threats and abuse. The firm recently introduced a ""report Tweet"" button to try to combat the problem. Mr Sippey said that Twitter's initial decision to change the way blocking works was a further attempt to prevent abuse, by ensuring that users did not know they had been blocked by someone. He said blocked users - and sometimes even their friends - often retaliated against the people who had blocked them, resulting in increased bullying. ""Some users worry just as much about post-blocking retaliation as they do about pre-blocking abuse,"" he explained. He added that Twitter ""will continue to explore features designed to protect users from abuse and prevent retaliation"".","Twitter has reversed changes it made to how people block other users, less than a day after they were introduced."
"By Dave LeeTechnology reporter, BBC News Northcliffe Media, which is owned by the Daily Mail Group, issued a subpoena to the social network through a Californian court. The account, @UnSteveDorkland , is a ""parody"" of Northcliffe's chief executive Steve Auckland. The company said the tweets were ""obsessive and offensive"". ""I can confirm we have taken action to ask Twitter for help in identifying the individual in order to protect our staff from harassment,"" Mr Auckland said in a statement. ""We made no request for, nor had any input in, a decision to stop tweeting. Our first priority is a duty of care to all of our employees."" However, speaking anonymously to the BBC, the account's owner disputed the claims of harassment. ""People can make their own judgement,"" he said. ""I've not taken anything down. It's all in the public domain, I've not touched them at all."" The order means Twitter must give up all identifying information it has on the account holder. In an email seen by the BBC, the social network advised the account holder that he could seek the help of the campaign group the Electronic Frontier Foundation or the American Civil Liberties Union. Legal advice The subpoena was first published on the Guido Fawkes blog earlier this week. In a follow-up post on Wednesday, the blog made public an email sent by Twitter in which it warned the account holder that ""Twitter is obligated to respond to lawful process and will do so on August 1, 2012, absent the filing of a motion to quash"". The account holder told the BBC that he did not have the means to hire a lawyer in the US, and so therefore is not currently planning to fight the order. ""What I need at the minute is a very good pro-bono California lawyer,"" he said. ""As it stands, they'll hand over my details."" He dismissed claims that he was being fed information by employees at the company. ""Not one tweet is fed by anything other than my imagination and knowledge of the company,"" he told the BBC. ""I got lucky on a couple of guesses. I am uncontrolled by them, I am unmonitorable by them."" However, he added that since investigations had been taking place at the company sources had been keeping him up-to-date on its progress. 'Offensive nature' The account, which was originally called @Northcliffestev, often criticised decisions made by the real Mr Auckland in his role at Northcliffe. However, a source at the newspaper group insisted that this was not the motivation behind the legal action. ""Steve is a very open guy. The idea that he would gag someone just for being critical is just not credible - it was the offensive nature of the tweets."" Media lawyer David Allen Green, from Preiskel & Co, told the BBC that disclosure orders such as this should ""not be granted lightly by any court"". ""It is important that the court granted this order for a good and compelling legal reason and that the court also had appropriate regard to the right of free expression."" ""Parody and pseudonymous Twitter accounts are often useful or entertaining. To gain a disclosure order can in effect bring such accounts to an end,"" he said.",Twitter has warned the owner of an account spoofing a newspaper executive that they are to reveal his identity to the company.
"Dave LeeNorth America technology reporter Remarkably, that seemed to be the knee-jerk reaction of at least some of Silicon Valley’s elite in the wake of Donald Trump becoming president-elect on Tuesday. ""I am announcing and funding a legitimate campaign for California to become its own nation,” wrote Shervin Pishevar, a major investor in companies like Uber, AirBnB and Slack. ""I'm in and will partner with you on it,” replied Dave Morin, another major tech investor. It’s been agreed, the new promised land should be called New California. ""It's the most patriotic thing we can do,” Mr Pishevar said. The proposal - one that, let’s face it, is faintly ridiculous - represents peak panic in the wake of an election that has left much of Silicon Valley stunned and grasping for answers. ‘Open door' There are two bubbles in this part of the world - one is about money, the other is about its world view. On her disastrous night, Clinton got more votes in California than in any other part of the country. Here, the prospect of a Trump presidency wasn’t just unlikely, it was unthinkable. Before the vote, openly supporting Mr Trump was seen by many as a crime worthy of losing your job. When it emerged that Facebook board member and major investor Peter Thiel was donating more than $1m to the Trump campaign, many called for him to be sacked. But just a few weeks on, Mr Thiel, a person who has made his vast fortune over long-term bets, proved to be the most astute man in the Valley once again. “He has an awesomely difficult task, since it is long past time for us to face up to our country’s problems,” he said in a statement after Mr Trump’s win. ""We’re going to need all hands on deck.” Coming to terms Mr Thiel remains an outlier here. What we’ll likely see over the next few days is an industry and community slowly contemplating what life in Silicon Valley will mean under President Trump. Chris Sacca, an early investor in Twitter, said technology companies should be open to the new leader. ""We in the tech community are willing to work with President-Elect Trump to help those Americans who need it most,” he tweeted. ""The door is open. ""Very few people were as vocal in their opposition to Donald Trump as I was. But sitting on our hands for four years is a bad option."" As I type, we’re yet to hear from the real key players: Apple, Facebook and Google. Their message will be instrumental in setting the collective mood here. Meanwhile, Twitter boss Jack Dorsey may be enjoying one silver lining: shares in the struggling network, still by far the best platform on a day like Tuesday, jumped 4% to its best pricing since October.

"The country's defence ministry wants to develop weapons similar to Stuxnet, the software designed to attack Iranian nuclear enrichment plants. The South Korean military will carry out missions using the software, the defence ministry said. One computer security expert said that using cyberweapons could be ""very dangerous"". The defence ministry reported its plan to the government on 19 February, the Yonhap news agency reported. In 2006, North Korea said it had successfully tested a nuclear weapon, spreading alarm through the region. Intensive diplomatic efforts to try to rein in North Korea's nuclear ambitions continue. Online propaganda The development of weapons capable of physically damaging North Korean nuclear plants and missile facilities is the second phase of a strategy that began in 2010, Yonhap said. The first part of South Korea's plan, which is continuing, is to conduct online propaganda operations by posting to North Korean social networking and social media services. ""Once the second phase plan is established, the cybercommand will carry out comprehensive cyberwarfare missions,"" a senior ministry official said. The South Korean cyberwarfare command, which will use the weapons, has been dogged by accusations of using its psychological warfare capabilities on its own population to try to influence voters in the run-up to the 2012 presidential elections. Attempting to use cyberweapons to physically damage critical infrastructure could drastically backfire, Prof Alan Woodward, a computer security expert at the University of Surrey, told the BBC. ""I think it's very dangerous,"" he said. ""[The weapon] could end up damaging all sorts of things you never intended it to."" Once Stuxnet was released, its spread was impossible to predict or control, Prof Woodward said. Vulnerable The code was designed to target Iranian nuclear enrichment facilities and disrupt a suspected nuclear weapons development programme. However, the code attacked Siemens control systems used not only in the facilities but also in electrical generation plants, factories and water treatment works. ""You might be targeting one thing, but it could spread,"" Prof Woodward said. ""All those other forms of infrastructure become vulnerable."" Malicious code such as Stuxnet does not respect national boundaries. Cyber-attack code developed by South Korea could rebound and end up damaging South Korean infrastructure that uses the same technologies, he said. The code could spread internationally. In addition, once the attack code is released, malicious hackers or military personnel anywhere in the world would be able to study a sample and use the weapons against another target, Prof Woodward added.",South Korea is to develop cyber-attack tools in an attempt to damage North Korean nuclear facilities.
"By James ClaytonNorth America technology reporter She says she was fired by Google after it took issue with an academic paper she had co-authored. And Dr Gebru and her supporters believe institutional racism played a role in her departure. The paper focused on issues related to AI language models - including structural bias against women and people belonging to ethnic minorities. Google says the paper omitted relevant research on the topic and Dr Gebru resigned. An open letter demanding to know why the paper was rejected has been signed by more than 6,000 people, including prominent researchers at Google and its DeepMind division as well as Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Netflix, among others. Google chief executive Sundar Pichai wrote in a memo: ""We need to accept responsibility for the fact that a prominent black, female leader with immense talent left Google unhappily. ""It's incredibly important to me that our black, women, and under-represented Googlers know that we value you and you do belong at Google."" He added the company would investigate its handling of the matter but stopped short of apologising for Dr Gebru's departure. Dr Gebru is far from satisfied with that response and has now spoken to the BBC. The following interview has been edited for brevity and clarity. What have the past couple of weeks been like for you on a personal level? They have been exhausting. It is not fun to be in the spotlight like this. I feel like I've been thrown into a storm. What was the paper about? I did not expect it to be such a wave-making paper or anything like that. The paper was about the ethical considerations of development research and development of large language models - one of which was bias. Google says the paper didn't contain some of the latest research on the subject. First of all, that's not true. Secondly, imagine if it was true - are you really going to justify terminating someone the way they terminated me because the paper didn't contain a literature review? But it's absolutely not true. Do you think that Google would have treated you differently if you were a white man? I have definitely been treated differently. In all of the cases that I've seen in the past, they [Google] try so hard not to make it a headline. They try so hard to make it smooth. When it's some other person who is toxic, there are always these conversations about: ""Oh, but you know, they're so valuable to the company, they're a genius, they're just socially awkward, et cetera."" My entire team is completely behind me and they're taking risks. They're taking actual risks to stand behind me. My manager is standing behind me. And even still, they decided to treat me in this way. So definitely, I feel like I've been treated differently. I suppose if you think that, the next obvious question is do you think Google itself is institutionally racist? Yes, Google itself is institutionally racist. That's quite a thing to say - you were a Google employee until a short while ago. I feel like most if not all tech companies are institutionally racist. I mean, how can I not say that they are not institutionally racist? The Congressional Black Caucus is the one who's forcing them to publish their diversity numbers. It's not by accident that black women have one of the lowest retention rates[, in the technology industry]. So for sure Google and all of the other tech companies are institutionally racist. Google says it cares about diversity. Do you agree? I don't agree that Google cares about diversity. What they need to do is be comfortable with these kinds of uncomfortable discussions - don't silence people, don't retaliate against them. What they're doing is saying: ""OK, we're going to have some random committee,"" or: ""We're going to invest a certain number of million dollars into something."" But when it comes to someone challenging the status quo in the slightest possible way, you see what just happened? So I think it's just very difficult for me to believe that they care about diversity. Sundar Pichai has apologised for the circumstances around your departure but not for the departure itself. How do you feel about that? He didn't even apologise for the company's handling of it. He said this has sowed doubts among some in our community, that they feel like they might not belong. And for that, he's sorry. So it doesn't say: ""I'm sorry for the way we handled this. We were wrong. I'm sorry for what we did to her,"" - nothing. I don't consider it an apology whatsoever. I consider it a statement that had to be made to make them look better, How do you see AI going forward? Do you do you worry about racial discrimination in AI? Definitely - and a lot of people have said that they think the next frontier for discrimination… is in this in this kind of technological realm in AI. And so because of that, I worry very much about it. And I and many - especially black - women have been writing about this and even teaching classes about this. Unless there is some sort of shift of power, where people who are most affected by these technologies are allowed to shape them as well and be able to imagine what these technologies should look like from the ground up and build them according to that, unless we move towards that kind of future, I am really worried that these tools are going to be used for more for harm than good. What are you going to do now? I need to take some time to think about what I'll be doing next. Right now, my priority is the safety of the people who've been supporting me. I do not want any sort of retaliation against them. So that's my priority right now. BBC News put the accusations in this interview to Google. It declined to comment but directed BBC News to Mr Pichai's memo and a statement made by Google AI head Jeff Dean, raising concerns about ""gaps"" in Dr Gebru's research paper.

"A Swiss biologist is developing a collar that can monitor a sheep's heart rate and spot when it is distressed. The collar will call a shepherd if it spots that the heart rate of an animal has increased for an extended period. Sheep are increasingly coming under attack by wolves in Switzerland and even those that survive often break fences and run miles as they escape. Sheer panic Early prototypes of the collar, employing heart rate monitors similar to those used by runners to fine-tune their training, have been tested on 12 Swiss sheep. The tests, carried out in the Bernese Alps above Les Diablerets, involved scaring the sheep with two muzzled Czechoslovakian Wolfdogs. This revealed that the resting heart rate of a sheep of about 60-80 beats-per-minute rises almost threefold when the animal is stressed. Wolf expert Jean-Marc Landry from Swiss carnivore research group Kora came up with the idea for the collar in a bid to limit the number of sheep lost to wolves reaching Switzerland from Italy. Growing numbers of sheep are being eaten by wolves, especially among small flocks owned by farmers who cannot afford a sheepdog. Even those that are not eaten trample down fences and flee long distances when being hunted. Dr Landry said the first collars would be produced in the autumn and he was considering three different techniques to help protect the sheep. The collars could be fitted with a mobile chip that alerted a shepherd via text message when the sheep were stressed. Alternatively they might play a loud noise or spray a chemical repellent to frighten off the wolf. Other countries such as France and Norway have shown interest in the collar project.",Swiss sheep could soon be texting shepherds for help when they are being stalked or attacked by wolves.
"For the last six weeks I have kept strange company. I have mixed with ewhores, quizzed hardened hackers, asked account hijackers how their day is going, tried to get malware makers to talk about their trade and debated ethics with people who steal cash using remote access viruses. All these people are on web discussion forums I joined as part of a special project taking a closer look at cyber crime. I registered on a few sites known for their interest in hacking but spent most of my time on Hack Forums. Its three million registered members make it one of the biggest places in the world for chatter about hacking - in all its forms. It is an exhilarating place to visit. It has separate boards dedicated to all kinds of hacking activity, many of which I had heard of and some that I had not. It is also a surprisingly complex community. For every message asking ""How do I hack Facebook?"" there are as many debating esoteric ways to interrogate a website and find chinks in its armour to get at what lies within. ""The site at first glance seems like a bunch of monkeys trying to figure out algebra,"" wrote Armada, one of the site's regular members whom I spoke to. Who are you? The big problem I faced joining the site is that I am a nobody. Sites such as Hack Forums and many others operate on a reputation economy. Long-standing members who have proved their worth to the community and who have lots of ""vouches"" from others have the best reputation and highest access. By contrast newbies, like me, get almost none. I'd have to contribute 25 good quality posts before I could send any personal messages. This would make it hard to contact people directly - my preferred method. I could, and did, post directly to discussion groups but the risk is that as a journalist I'm a tempting target for anyone keen to make their name by catching me out. Especially as some HF residents specialise in social engineering attacks that help them take control of other people's social media accounts. So, I went around these blocks and dropped messages to the off-board accounts that long-standing members advertised. Many use HF as a place to offer their own guides and services that are available elsewhere. I got in touch via Skype names, Jabber instant message accounts, email addresses and through website contact forms. Most often I got no response. Or no further reply after one exchange during which I told them I worked for the BBC. A few people thought I was a cop posing as a journalist looking to trick people into opening up. One asked me to prove who I said I was by taking a picture with some photo ID. I took the snap but just as I was about to send it some of the folks I contacted, including Armada, had checked me out and reassured themselves that I was who I said I was. ""We have members on an almost universal scale with skill sets ranging from being able to turn a computer on, to critical vulnerability exploitation,"" wrote Armada. ""Certainly, not all members are great hackers, and not all are completely inept either, but it varies from person to person,"" wrote True Demon in response to my questions. ""The one great thing about HF is that it is a safe place to discuss the fine art of hacking, or whatever else catches your interest."" True Demon added that he was only giving his own opinion rather than speaking for the wider hacker community. Smart script The other main reason for wanting to spend time there is to get to grips with the sub-culture of teenagers who are dabbling with cyber crime. It is not just me who is curious about members of this rapidly growing group who are often given the name ""script kiddies"" - this is not a term of endearment. The UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) is also interested in them because of the growing numbers of young men it is dealing with who have been caught because they used the types of tools found on HF or employ the techniques that can be learned there. ""I can think of 10-15 arrests in the last 6 months in which all the people have been under the age of 18,"" said Richard Jones, head of the NCA's Prevent programme that tries to stop young people tumbling into a life of cyber crime. Last week, the UK's South East Regional Organised Crime Unit arrested a 16-year-old from the East Midlands who is believed to be part of the Crackas With Attitude hacking group that targeted CIA director John Brennan, among others. Earlier operations have netted fledgling hackers as young as 12. ""We are seeing more people getting into cyber crime in the UK,"" said Mr Jones ""It is getting more accessible as well - the internet makes it very easy for young people to learn about it."" Many of the low level hacks they use are gateways to ever more nefarious activity, he told the BBC. The ""script kiddy"" state of mind is one that is regularly debated on HF. On one lengthy message thread, a member called Disparity kicked off the discussion about morals by calling people who use remote access tools ""worthless, ethic-lacking scum"". As their name implies, remote access programs give their creators access to a victims' PC. Some use this access to spy, steal or profit. Instead, said Disparity, such people would be better off learning more and practising more ""acceptable morals"". In response, ClawzTech wrote of his victims: ""If they're dumb enough to get infected, then they need to be punished."" True Demon said he was also concerned about the decisions some younger members take. ""I still worry about the ethical decisions that some HF users choose,"" he said. ""The majority of HF users, myself included, actively discourage others from performing illegal activity with the knowledge they gain there."" He added that the ""scare tactics"" of the NCA and others can be counter-productive. ""They should be encouraging kids to learn this stuff, but to do so in an ethical and structured format."" he said ""They would have a lot more people working with their cyber-division, if they did. ""Government and law enforcement have a tendency to paint hackers as a whole in a bad light, ostracising the subculture as malicious, dangerous, and evil,"" he said. ""Don't you think it would be better to foster and instruct those kinds of kids to use their skills for good, rather than treating them like they are some kind of criminal?""",It takes time to win the trust of hackers who hang out online.
"Launched in February, Buzz enrolled all Gmail users into a social network based around their contacts. The service was criticised because users initially had relatively little control over who could see their network of contacts. Several Gmail users took Google to court over Buzz saying the network violated personal privacy. The lump sum is at the centre of Google's proposed settlement of the legal case, of which 30% will be used to pay legal fees, the seven Gmail users who brought the case will get $2,500 each and the remainder will be shared among organisations that promote online privacy. The settlement also requires Google to do more to educate people about the privacy aspects of Buzz. The settlement has yet to win approval from the federal judge overseeing the case. The initial rash of complaints about Buzz forced Google to bring in changes that made it an opt-in service and gave users control over who they maintain contact with. Search suit In a separate development, Google is facing an investigation by the attorney general of Texas into how it manipulates search results. The investigation started in July and aims to find out if the way Google treats search results violates the state's anti-trust laws. Complaints by three firms - Foundem, SourceTool and MyTriggers - are thought to have kick-started investigation. Don Harrison, deputy general counsel at Google, wrote on the company blog that the company was ""looking forward"" to working with the attorney general's office as it was ""confident"" it was acting in the best interests of users. Mr Harrison also suggested that arch-rival Microsoft was providing help and financing to the search firms making complaints.",Google has proposed paying $8.5m (£5.5m) to settle a lawsuit brought over its Buzz social network.
"The worst bugs could let attackers overcharge satellite antenna to damage the equipment or harm operators. And others could be used to betray the exact location of military forces in crisis zones, the researcher said. IOActive, which found the bugs, said it was working with manufacturers to harden devices against attack. Backdoor access ""The consequences of these vulnerabilities are shocking,"" said Ruben Santamarta, from IOActive, in a statement explaining some of his findings. Details of the vulnerabilities will be presented later on Thursday at the Black Hat security conference in Las Vegas. The broadest group of devices vulnerable to attack were in use on commercial aircraft, Mr Santamarta told technology news site eWeek. Some of the vulnerabilities affecting aircraft required an attacker to be on that flight, he said, but he had also found ""hundreds"" of vulnerable devices that could be accessed remotely via the internet. None of the loopholes gave an attacker access to the avionics systems used to control flight, however. Other problems had been found with satellite ground stations on ships and in US military bases, Mr Santamarta said. On ship systems, attackers could potentially gain control over satellite receivers to aid eavesdropping or damage the antenna by pumping up its power output, he said. Mr Santamarta had won access to the satellite communication systems via backdoors in their controlling code, he said. The backdoors had not been inserted maliciously but had probably been added during software development. Although, in some cases the devices being used could not be updated with secure software. Instead, the entire device would have to be swapped for a more modern version running less hackable code. IOActive says it delayed publishing details of its findings while manufacturers act to negate the bugs. And the latest research builds on work done by Mr Santamarta in 2014 which first unearthed potential problems with the satellite communication systems and devices.","Satellite systems used on aircraft, ships and by the military contain bugs that could let hackers take control of them, a security researcher has warned."
"By Dave LeeTechnology reporter, BBC News By sharing shocking images and video showing the killing of US journalist James Foley, IS has brought to the fore an issue many have warned about: that social networks are locked in a continual battle against extremists and the spread of shocking propaganda online. Some experts say the networks are losing this battle, as more and more messages - many purporting to be from news agencies - flood services. Others argue that social networks are doing what they can to protect users, and that measures in place to flag and remove content are effective. Meanwhile, some have criticised social networks for putting more effort into detecting copyright infringement than they have into removing harmful material. Here are the key issues. What is happening? After video of Foley appeared online, users on social networks urged others not to watch or share the clip. But the effectiveness of IS's approach is staggering - mimicking the kind of efforts corporations would invest millions in for marketing purposes. As the graphic video was circulated, some Twitter users started two hashtags - #ISISmediablackout and #DontShare - which sought to drown out messages showing the disturbing content, replacing it with images of Foley taken while he was working. But the reality is that extremists are finding new ways to circumvent the efforts of social networks trying to shut down accounts, a constant cat-and-mouse game that one source close to a major network described to the BBC as being a never-ending ""game of whack-a-mole"". JM Berger is an analyst specialising in monitoring extremism on social media. He says that the online actions of IS - formerly Isis - rival the efforts of the finest social media marketing experts in the world. Indeed, the swift ""brand name"" change from Isis to IS has shown the effectiveness of the group's online message. In spreading propaganda, one tactic utilised by the group stood out - a specially created app that, when willingly exposed on a person's phone, would tweet co-ordinated propaganda messages worded by IS, carefully timed not to fall foul of Twitter's spam filter. In one example, 40,000 tweets were sent in this way in just one day. Given the vast number of tweets, and more importantly, the vast number of usernames being used to spread such messages, it was extremely difficult for Twitter to remove the material. What can be done? There is some progress. In the past week, Twitter has been acting to disable dozens of prominent accounts believed to belong to prominent IS members. It is making it harder for IS to spread its message, JM Berger told the BBC. ""IS has been struggling with how to respond to suspended accounts on Twitter. ""In reality, Twitter is one of the most permissive social media environments for them."" But he added: ""While several dozen accounts have been suspended over the last few weeks, many more have remained online and many of those who have been suspended come back with new accounts."" One further tactic seemingly employed by IS supporters has been to temporarily deactivate their own accounts in an attempt to avoid a ban, although the BBC understands this has no impact on Twitter's ability to suspend inappropriate accounts. Furthermore, noted Mr Berger, Twitter's ability to share links easily meant that while some IS members may be banned from Twitter itself, they were now beginning to appear on smaller social networks posting material that could then be passed on. One network, Diaspora, appears to have emerged as the new network of choice for IS - it provides greater protections because of its decentralised nature. Child abuse images can be blocked with technology - why not extremism? The question of why extremist material cannot simply be blocked by websites is a question that is frequently asked - but has a complex answer. When dealing with images of child sexual abuse, many services use sophisticated technology to automatically check content that is being uploaded against a database of known abusive content. It means that images are, in theory, blocked before they are uploaded to the website in question. PhotoDNA, a Microsoft product, is a market-leading piece of software for carrying out this work. The BBC understands that the same technology could be applied to images known to be spreading extremist propaganda, but that there are currently no plans to do so. For video on YouTube, Google has created ContentID, a system set up to detect when users upload copyrighted material. It checks uploaded content against a known database of footage and audio - most often music videos - and allows the copyright owners to either remove or place advertising on the video. ContentID could be adapted to spot content known to be harmful - but Google is reluctant to put it to use in this way. This is for a variety of reasons, but most significantly it is because while child abuse imagery is easy to categorise - there's no grey area; it's all illegal - violent or shocking material relating to terrorism is harder to define. Often it is social networks that provide the only means of communication for those wanting to spread news of atrocities in hard-to-reach areas. Facebook and Google have both in the past said that shocking images are permitted in cases where they are shown in a ""news context"", rather than for glorification. Furthermore, the social networks are keen to argue that they should not be the guardians of what should be censored online. But Mr Berger said: ""As far as who should decide, Twitter and YouTube and all the rest are businesses, they are not public services or inalienable rights. ""Just as a movie theatre or restaurant can eject patrons who are harassing or threatening other patrons or engaging in criminal activity, online services have both the right and an obligation to take care of their customers and do the best they can to provide a safe environment."" How can I protect myself, or my children, from seeing this type of content? This is difficult. The very nature of social networks is that it is easy to share content, and the strength of Twitter and others is that information travels extremely quickly. This presents a problem - a teenager browsing Facebook could stumble across the video of Foley's death in their news feed if a friend posted it. More worryingly, many videos posted to Facebook now auto-play, meaning a user does not have to click to start seeing the footage. It's hard to avoid the possibility of seeing something upsetting, suggested security expert Graham Cluley. ""If your children are on the internet, it's an impossible task to completely shield them from some of the ghastly things going on in the world,"" he told the BBC. ""You can put your home computer in a shared room rather than a private bedroom, and have some oversight over what they're accessing online. But the proliferation of mobile devices makes it more difficult to oversee what your children are watching. ""Consider enabling parental controls that restrict which websites your kids can visit, but realise that it's an imperfect solution - it's perfectly possible that legitimate sites like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook might contain footage that many - young and old - would find harrowing."" Mr Cluley added that the best course of action for parents would be to spend time explaining what may have been seen. ""Talk to your children about the unpleasant and inappropriate things which can be watched on the net, and help them understand why it isn't cool to seek it out or to share it with their friends.""

"By Cody GodwinBBC News, San Francisco The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and 45 other states sued Facebook for alleged anti-competitive behaviour in December. The lawsuit requested the breaking up of the company, which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp. On Wednesday, Facebook described the complaint as ""nonsensical"" and asked the judge to throw the case out. In a statement, Facebook said the case ""ignores the reality of the dynamic, intensely competitive high-tech industry in which Facebook operates"". The FTC has until 7 April to respond. Facebook purchased Instagram for $1bn (£718m) in 2012 and WhatsApp for $19bn (£13.6bn) in 2014 - which the FTC claims was done to ""eliminate threats to its monopoly"". It was revealed in 2019 that Facebook owns four of the most downloaded apps of the decade: Facebook, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp and Instagram. However, the FTC's actions surprised many by requesting the break-up of the social network, which, if it were to happen, would be a landmark decision against Big Tech. The FTC also wants Facebook to notify officials of any acquisition of more than $10m (£7.2m). Facebook's motion says the lawsuit fails to back up the claims that the social media giant is a monopoly, anti-competitive or in violation of the law. New York Attorney General Letitia James responded, saying that Facebook was ""wrong on the law and wrong on our complaint"". ""We are confident in our case, which is why almost every state in this nation has joined our bipartisan lawsuit to end Facebook's illegal conduct."" Too much power Facebook is not the only tech company facing anti-trust lawsuits in the US. Google was hit with a lawsuit in October alleging the company has a monopoly over search results and online advertising. In July, the bosses of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google appeared before a Judiciary Committee to defend their companies against these claims. Democrat Congressman David Cicilline, the committee chairman, said, ""Some [Big Tech firms] need to be broken up and all need to be properly regulated."" Regulators are looking to limit the power of Big Tech to create more competitive markets for smaller companies. And it's not just US regulators who are concerned. The European Commission is investigating whether Apple and Facebook have violated EU competition rules. They also charged Amazon for abusing EU competition rules in November. And in the UK, Apple is under investigation for anti-competitive behaviour.",Facebook has asked a US judge to dismiss anti-trust charges levelled against the company.
"The IDs were reportedly sourced from a breach four years ago, which had previously been thought to have included a fraction of that number. At the time, the business-focused social network said it had reset the accounts of those it thought had been compromised. LinkedIn now plans to repeat the measure on a much larger scale. One expert said the service should have reset all its accounts the first time round. LinkedIn is often used to send work-related messages and to find career opportunities - activities its members would want to stay private. Criminals could make use of this information or see if its subscribers had used the same passwords elsewhere. ""We are taking immediate steps to invalidate the passwords of the accounts impacted, and we will contact those members to reset their passwords,"" a spokeswoman for the California-based firm told the BBC. ""We have no indication that this is a result of a new security breach. ""We encourage our members to visit our safety centre to ensure they have two-step verification authentication and to use strong passwords in order to keep their accounts as safe as possible."" Login leak Details of the sale were first reported by the news site Motherboard. It said the details were being advertised on at least two hacking-related sites. A total of 117 million passwords are said to be included. The passcodes are encoded, but in a form that appears to have been relatively easy to reverse-engineer. LinkedIn had about 165 million accounts at the time of the breach, but the discrepancy in the figures might be explained by the fact that some of its users logged in via Facebook. Invalidated IDs After the breach first occurred, a file containing 6.5 million encrypted passwords was posted to an online forum in Russia. LinkedIn reacted by saying it had invalidated all the accounts it believed had been compromised and emailed affected members saying they needed to register new passwords. But Motherboard has tracked down one user, whose details are in the batch currently on sale, and found that the password listed for him was still active. A security researcher who has also been given access to about one million of the advertised IDs said he believed it was ""highly likely"" that the leak was real. ""I've personally verified the data with multiple subscribers [of my own site] 'Have I been pwned',"" Troy Hunt told the BBC. ""They've looked at the passwords in the dump and confirmed they're legitimate."" Another expert noted that the problem stemmed from the fact that LinkedIn had originally ""hashed"" its passwords but not ""salted"" them before storing them. Hashing involves using an algorithm to convert passwords into a long string of digits. Salting is an additional step meant to stop unauthorised parties from being able to work around the process. ""A salt involves adding a few random characters, which are different on a per-user basis, to the passwords [before they are hashed],"" explained Rik Ferguson, chief technology officer at the cybersecurity firm Trend Micro. By doing this, he added, you prevent hackers from being able to refer to so-called ""rainbow tables"" that list commonly-used passwords and the various hashes they produce, and then see if any of the hashes match those in the stolen database. LinkedIn introduced salting after the attack, but that only benefits the login databases it generated afterwards. ""Using salting is absolutely best practice for storing passwords under any circumstances and was the case back in 2012 as well,"" Mr Ferguson said. ""If LinkedIn is saying now that it didn't know which accounts had been affected by the breach, then the sensible thing to have done at the time would have been a system-wide forced reset of every password.""",A hacker is advertising what he says is more than one hundred million LinkedIn logins for sale.
"By Dave LeeTechnology reporter, Los Angeles No flashing lights, no pounding music, no booth babes. But boy, has it stolen the show. Its game, No Man's Sky - an ""open world"" science -fiction game title - has arguably generated more buzz than any other title on show here in Los Angeles. Shown on-screen as part of Sony's PlayStation press conference earlier this week, it had the audience cheering - and other developers looking on with envy. Because unlike the other titles lavished with that kind of attention, this isn't a game created by hundreds of people for millions of dollars. Rather, No Man's Sky began its life in a makeshift office above a tile shop in Guildford, a town just outside London. ""It's absolutely insane,"" laughs Sean Murray, Hello Games' co-founder, in an interview with the BBC. ""We were on stage for about five or six minutes. Pretty much the only other people who got that were teams of hundreds. Hello Games in total is 10 people, with just a handful working on No Man's Sky."" 'Fun' flood Back in December, with the team now working out of a glorified shed, the glitz of E3 felt a long way away for Hello Games. ""Guildford and a lot of the UK was super-badly flooded. We lost all of our equipment, it pretty much wiped out the office. It was Christmas Eve. ""Christmas day we were there just chucking everything out and starting again. We'd lost so much."" ""But this team, we love crisis and problems. We all banded together. I shouldn't say this, but in a weird way it's sort of fun - or at least it's part of the journey, part of the adventure."" Competitive creators The level of competitiveness in trying to secure exclusive titles from independent developers is heating up, as Sony and Microsoft are both desperate to be seen as the place to be for indies. Chris Charla heads up Microsoft's ID@Xbox programme. IDs - standing for independent developers - are a major fixture on the Xbox stand, with just under 40 titles available to play. But No Man's Sky is an obvious sore point for Mr Charla. ""I think No Man's Sky is a really really cool looking game,"" he says, through gritted teeth. ""I'm excited to play it."" He refuses to be drawn on whether his team was frustrated that it would appear on PS4 first. ""I think they're a fantastic developer."" Shelf Life Microsoft and Sony both like to paint their eagerness to empower indie developers as an almost charitable effort. But in truth, says Ovum analyst Paul Jackson, it's very serious business. ""Indie games are quick to develop,"" he says. ""And Microsoft and Sony need next-gen titles."" Many of the biggest games coming up on the consoles won't be on the shelves until 2015 - something of an issue in the run up to Christmas. Indies provide a trendy way to plug the gap. ""They need to add to the number of games that are available, and make a healthy release pipeline for this year"" Mr Jackson says. Microsoft's Mr Charla acknowledges that indies do help make online store shelves stay fresh. ""To us it's really important that when someone turns on their Xbox One, they see new content, they see a broad array of content, and they see a really diverse array of content."" Whatever the motives, Mr Jackson argues that gamers are the eventual winners - as indie developers dare to break ground the more risk-averse publishers would never dream of getting near. Sensible soccer Perhaps the embodiment of that attitude is Frank Cifaldi from indie outfit Other Ocean. Standing beside his spot on the Xbox stand, he is showing off his studio's game, #IDARB. The game can be played by eight people at once, around one screen, and the aim is to simply fire a ball into an opponent's net, like football. The game has echoes of the epically playable Sensible Soccer series, a world away from the painstaking simulation of the Fifa series. The hashtag in #IDARB isn't a corny marketing ploy - the game has a terrifically unique social media tie-in. Each match played on the game has a unique code. Anyone in the world can send a tweet with that code and activate bizarre actions to take place in the game. ""Could you imagine this game on PlayStation 2? Could you imagine buying this in a store? There was no way to sell it,"" says Mr Cifaldi. ""It's not like no-one wanted this stuff, it was just that your only option for selling a game was in a box. ""We're free to do this now."" Enormous It's easy to group indie games as being titles that are small, quirky, fun - or even just nostalgic. In that regard, No Man's Sky is a game changer. Alongside the multi-million dollar budgets of the biggest titles like Call of Duty and Assassin's Creed, No Man's Sky does not look like an indie game. Rather than hire huge teams to painstakingly create levels, and worlds, that take months and years to build, the Hello Games team has instead put its efforts into creating a system that is essentially able to generate highly complex worlds itself. ""We're trying to do it procedurally,"" explains Mr Murray, ""using next-gen consoles and PCs to make that content for us, and make that process easier. Once that constraint is removed we're a lot freer."" The game is about exploration, and the procedural world-building technology means that when you fly out into the distance, you're covering ground never before seen by anyone else playing the game. In Sony's media suite at E3, the BBC finds Shahid Ahmad. As Sony's lead for independent games in Europe, he looks like a man who has just discovered buried treasure. ""No Man's Sky is an enormous deal,"" he says. ""Infinite, you could say. It's one of the most inspirational titles that we've seen. ""For me No Man's Sky evokes the hope of sci-fi, and the pioneering spirit. It's a great story. We're absolutely delighted."" Now, it's all down to the Hello Games team to get the game finished. No pressure, chaps.",The Hello Games team doesn't have a stand at E3.
"The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) is advising people to tweak the settings after buying them. Easy-to-guess default passwords might let a hacker secretly observe a home through connected devices, it said. The NCSC's technical director, Dr Ian Levy, warned while the devices were ""fantastic innovations"", they were vulnerable to cyber-attackers. There are many examples of devices being accessed without permission. In one, the attacker spoke to a young girl, pretending to be Father Christmas. In another, a couple from Leeds had been watched thousands of times online without their knowledge. And security researchers easily breached an adult toy that had a camera attached, in 2017. The new guidance for owners of smart cameras suggests three steps: This warning suggests growing concern about the potential dangers posed by the ""internet of things"". As connected devices move into people's homes and everyday lives, cyber-security risks are becoming intensely personal, with challenges in protecting people's data and privacy. Cameras that provide details of what is going on inside your house are a prime example. One of the problems is the companies making these devices often try to make them cheap and fast to capture the new market - and security is often an afterthought, if it is thought about at all. The problem is leading towards not just more warnings such as this one but also new laws to mandate security standards. Consumer group Which?, which has highlighted security flaws in the past in children's toys and other smart devices, backed the new advice. It says ""mandatory security requirements and strong enforcement"" are needed. In January, the government announced plans to bring in a new law to require all manufacturers selling smart devices in the UK to obey new rules. But while such regulations are ""a positive step"", some experts believe they could go further. Additional steps could include mandatory two-factor authentication, according to Blake Kozak, a smart home analyst with Omdia. ""More detailed legislation will be needed to enforce best practices by brands, from the components in the devices to the security of data centres,"" he said. The NCSC's latest guidance also recommends disabling UPnP (universal plug and play) and ""port forwarding"" in the settings of your internet router – technologies often used by legitimate services such as online gaming.","Smart cameras and baby monitors can be watched by criminals over the internet by default, security chiefs warn."
"By Leo KelionTechnology reporter He spoke of concerns that some attendees would push for a UN agency to ""run the internet"" rather than leaving it to groups already ""doing a good job"". Internet pioneer Vint Cerf has also highlighted the issue on Google's site. But the UN agency itself is playing down suggestions of a power-grab. Dr Hamadoun Toure, secretary-general of the UN's International Telecommunications Union (ITU), said ahead of the event: ""There is no need for the ITU to take over the internet governance."" Internet governance The United Arab Emirates is playing host to 193 countries at World Conference on International Telecommunications (Wcit). They aim to revise a telecommunications treaty which has not been overhauled since 1988. The ITU has said there was a need to address the fact technologies like the internet were not properly addressed by the current regulations, and that more efforts must be made to change the fact that ""two-thirds of the world's population"" did not have access to the net. Among the proposals being considered is a clause put forward by Russia which says: ""Member states shall have equal rights to manage the internet, including in regard to the allotment, assignment and reclamation of internet numbering, naming, addressing and identification resources and to support for the operation and development of basic internet infrastructure."" This has been interpreted by some as a starting point for domain name regulator Icann, the Internet Engineering Task Force and other organisations that oversee the internet's technical specifications to be forced to be pass at least some of their powers to another body such as the ITU. Sir Tim is director of a standards body himself - the World Wide Web Consortium. He said that governments can already influence changes but should resist further interference. ""I think it's important that these existing structures continue to be used without any attempt to bypass them,"" he said. ""These organisations have been around for a number of years and I think it would be a disruptive threat to the stability of the system for people to try to set up alternative organisations to do the standards."" Accelerating access Sir Tim also indicated that there was no need to create new internet-specific sections to an international treaty in order to improve access. ""It seems that at the moment the growth of the internet is spectacular and the developing countries have the highest growth rate. ""A few years ago we started [World Wide] Web Foundation worrying that connectivity was relevant, but now today connectivity is clearly becoming ubiquitous - we need to look at other concerns such as net neutrality and whether governments spy on the internet and whether they block it. ""A lot of concerns I've heard from people have been that, in fact, countries that want to be able to block the internet and give people within their country a 'secure' view of what's out there would use a treaty at the ITU as a mechanism to do that, and force other countries to fall into line with the blockages that they wanted to put in place."" However, Sir Tim added that resistance to such an idea by other nations would mean the problem could be avoided. The ITU's leader has said he intends to prevent any measure being put to a vote, and that proposals must be agreed, instead, by consensus. The US has already made clear that it would block any attempt by Russia or another country to make changes to internet governance. ""We will actively oppose the Russian proposal,"" said Terry Kramer, the US ambassador to Wcit, last week. ""We have had good working relationships with our Russian colleagues, but the proposal that actually came out, to us, was shocking."" The US is now pressing for there to be no reference to the internet in the treaty. Human rights Early discussions at Wcit have included a debate over an internet-related clause championed by Tunisia. It said the revised treaty should contain a clause committing member states to protecting freedom of expression on the net including ""the freedom of online peaceful assembly"". The ITU said the text sparked a ""vigorous debate"", but was deemed unnecessary since such the issue was already addressed by human rights treaties which take precedence over whatever would ultimately be included in the communications agreement, The conference continues until 14 December.",Sir Tim Berners-Lee - inventor of the world wide web - is the latest voice to raise concerns about a meeting of communication tech regulators in Dubai.
"Google's sister-company Loon has announced its first commercial deal: partnering with Telkom Kenya to deliver connectivity to the region. The firm's antennae-dangling fleet will ride the wind high above parts of the African country. But experts have warned that the partnership could lead to a communications monopoly. Originally known as Project Loon, the technology behind the internet balloons was developed under parent company Alphabet's experimental division, X. Earlier this month, the business ""graduated"" to become a fully fledged subsidiary in its own right: Loon. As part of its first commercial agreement, Loon has pledged to bring internet access to some of Kenya's most inaccessible regions. The specific terms of the deal have not been disclosed. ""We will work very hard with Loon, to deliver the first commercial mobile service, as quickly as possible, using Loon's balloon-powered Internet in Africa,"" said Aldo Mareuse, chief executive of Telkom. Loon's balloons float high in the stratosphere, around 20km (12.4 miles) above sea level; a height the company says is out of range of air traffic, storms and wildlife. The tennis-court-sized balloon is made from polyethylene, filled with helium and powered by a solar panel. The balloons are designed to stay aloft for months at a time, and move by surfing wind channels, predicting speeds and directions so that they can navigate in the direction they need to travel. Each balloon carries an antenna, which relays internet signals transmitted from the ground, extending coverage over an area of 5,000sq km. In the case of this new partnership, Telkom Kenya will be providing the internet signals, and Loon will spread it over remote areas of Kenya. At the mercy of Alphabet ""Connectivity in these rural locations is a big problem,"" said Ken Banks, an expert in African connectivity, and head of social impact at Yoti. He explained that attempts to install a physical infrastructure in the region have been plagued with problems. The vast distances of the region mean that laying fibre cables or building an array of mobile masts is impractical. ""That only leaves the kinds of technology that Loon and other fully wireless solutions provide."" Much of Kenya's population of around 49 million people is catered for by mobile coverage, but enormous sections of the country are disconnected from internet providers. Mr Banks said Loon could be transformational for these areas, but he also warned that many people were concerned about building a reliance on commercial, foreign technology for something as critical as connectivity. ""Once these networks are in place, and dependency has reached a critical level, users are at the mercy of changes in business strategy, pricing, terms and conditions and so on. ""This would perhaps be less of a problem if there's more than one provider - you can simply switch network - but if Loon and Telkom have monopolies in these areas, that could be a ticking time bomb."" Kaluka Wanjala, a Nairobi-based technology blogger, said that delivering connectivity to rural areas ""will bring opportunities that we have seen the internet bring to other regions of Kenya"". Nanjira Sambuli, advocacy manager for the World Wide Web Foundation, noted that the UN Broadband Commission's target for internet affordability says 1GB of mobile data should cost no more than 2% of gross national income per capita. In Africa, 1GB of data currently costs an average of 18% of monthly income. ""So, the partnership is a good step towards advancing connectivity,"" she said. ""However, it is imperative that this partnership not only achieves quality connectivity (4G) but also that it is affordable and meaningful. ""Hopefully the infrastructure will also incentivise private sector and the government alike to consider facilitating public access solutions.""",A network of giant balloons will soon bring internet access to remote regions of rural Kenya.
"By Leo KelionTechnology reporter After previously describing Amazon as ""a ruthless, money-making devil"", Waterstones's managing director, James Daunt, announced in May that he was teaming up with the US internet store and would sell and promote its Kindle tablets and e-readers in the UK's premier book chain. Few predicted a happy ending: ""A deal for destruction"", ""Strange bedfellows"", and ""Waterstones let the fox into the chicken run"" exclaimed some of the resulting headlines. Had the former JP Morgan banker doomed the group less than a year after being appointed as its managing director? ""A world that is totally dominated by Amazon will be a poorer one,"" Mr Daunt tells the BBC when asked about the decision. ""But that is not to say that I don't think that Amazon is - within the limits of what it does - absolutely fantastic."" Secret deal The 49-year-old has already distanced Waterstones from its roots, dropping the apostrophe in its name to the dismay of punctuation campaigners. But the decision to ditch Sony's e-readers and promote Amazon's is clearly his most controversial to date. For someone who has apparently signed his company's death warrant he appears focused and optimistic about the group's future, determined to complete a costly refit programme designed to upgrade its 300 stores. And though he remains tight-lipped about the terms of the Amazon arrangement, he insists the agreement is to his advantage, whatever others suggest. ""I certainly won't tell you what I'm going to make with Amazon, but what I will freely admit is that we have a commercial business here, and we make sensible commercial decisions. ""I have, rather flippantly, also said: 'Do I look like a total moron? Because what you're describing is the behaviour of a total moron.' ""I may be many things, but I don't think I'm that."" Although the criticisms may have stung, Mr Daunt believes he has made the pragmatic choice. His customers are increasingly reading books on digital devices with Amazon proving their most popular option. To ignore the phenomenon, he argues, would undermine the bookseller's relationship with its readers. ""If they choose to read digitally I have to become involved in that game,"" he explains, adding that it would be beyond the firm's resources to develop its own family of tablets and e-readers. Instead he plans to offer add-on services - allowing visitors the chance to use Kindles to browse Waterstones's own recommendations and then read them for free while in-store. ""The principle is simple,"" he says. ""You are in a bookshop, you can pick up any of these books - you haven't bought them yet - you can browse them. Until you leave the shop you don't have to pay for them, and that same principle should apply to a physical device as well as a digital e-book."" Ultimately he hopes to be able to tailor recommendations to each shop's location and staff - but even in its basic state the feature won't be able to launch until technical issues are worked out and publishers sign up. Hot drinks Reports have suggested one way Waterstones would make money out of the deal would be to take a cut of each Kindle sale made over its stores' wi-fi networks. Mr Daunt would not confirm or deny the claim, saying only: ""We make money out of everything we sell."" A potential problem with this model is that once shoppers try out an e-reader - whether its a Kindle, Nook, Kobo or other device - they often browse bookshops's shelves, make lists of what they want but then buy via the internet at home. The e-book trend may be inevitable, critics say, but embracing it will only hasten Waterstones's decline. Mr Daunt suggests they misunderstand his methods. ""All that we have to do is encourage people to come into our shops and to choose the books,"" he says. ""I don't frankly care how they then consume then, or read them, or indeed buy them. ""But if you spend time in my shops, and you really enjoy it, and you come back more often and spend longer - you're going to spend money in my shops."" That money won't necessarily be on books. Waterstones stores are already stocking more stationery, games and puzzles. The next step is to create cafes inside the chain following a successful trial. ""It is literally the booksellers that's made you the cup of coffee,"" he says. ""Yes, it's slightly grubby that you've handed over two quid to get that cup of coffee - but it is extremely nice. ""The conversation as you buy your latte is often about the book and it's a really fantastic thing. And our sales have leapt."" The move may appall traditionalists, and making space for coffee and Kindles does ultimately mean less for bookshelves. But Mr Daunt says the action is overdue. ""Do we have an awful lot of books in our shops that don't frankly sell?"" he asks. ""Yes, and they actually shouldn't be there. I do think the shops will have less books, but they will remain absolutely first and foremost physical bookshops."" Fiction, cookery and biography will stay, he says, but specialised topics, such as law studies, face the chop. 'Fundamentally unsatisfactory' At the core of his strategy is the assumption that if his staff make the right picks and provide the right environment, customers will want to spend time in a book-browsing environment. ""I certainly believe that ownership of the physical book does matter,"" he adds. ""Whereas that little file embedded in a piece of plastic isn't pretty to look at. You can't lend it. You can't sell it. And you can't bequeath it to your children. ""Digital is convenient in some situations - travelling, or reading at night when you don't want to wake the wife. ""But it is also fundamentally unsatisfactory in all sorts of other ways. And that will preserve the physical book as being the majority choice for some foreseeable time, even fiction."" Whether Waterstones's next chapter goes as planned will now depend on how much the public are as wedded to the traditional format.",It was the twist no-one saw coming.
"Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks are designed to knock a website offline by flooding it with huge amounts of requests until it crashes. Amazon Web Services (AWS) said the February attack had fired 2.3Tbps. That is a little under half of all traffic BT sees on its entire UK network during a normal working day. The previous record, set in 2018, was 1.7Tbps. ""This is huge news for people in the industry,"" said Lisa Forte, from Red Goat Cyber Security, warning it was ""enormous"" compared with the previous all-time high. ""It is like comparing a moped to a super-car,"" she said. ""They are totally different beasts. ""These are outliers. ""But as always with cyber-threats, we are in an arms race against attackers every day. ""This will definitely be an alarming revelation to many and could be a warning that we should not ignore."" In a formal report about its DDoS protection service, AWS Shield, the company said the peak of the attack had been 44% larger than anything the service had seen before and resulted in a three-days of ""elevated threat"" status. But it did not identify what website or online service had been targeted by the attack. DDoS attacks are relatively simple in nature and rely on their sheer scale to be effective. They often utilise large numbers of machines compromised by malware to launch attacks, which can be purchased online from cyber-criminals relatively cheaply. They have been used by groups such as the hacktivist collective Anonymous to target the websites of companies or local governments they disagree with. However, protection services such as AWS Shield, Cloudflare, and Akamai, among others, have been used by many major online services in an attempt to limit their effectiveness.","Amazon says its online cloud, which provides the infrastructure on which many websites rely, has fended off the largest DDoS attack in history."
"Research from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) said 43.5 million adults were now online - one million more than in the same period last year. But 7.1 million remain offline, with the elderly and disabled still the least likely to be connected. One digital accessibility charity said the numbers were ""encouraging"" but more work was needed. ""It's not just about access to the internet,"" said Graham Walker, chief executive of Go On UK. ""Sixteen million adults don't have the basic online skills to confidently take advantage of digital tools."" The data was based on responses to the question: ""when did you last use the internet?"" The statistics indicate London has highest rate of internet users (90%), while Northern Ireland has the lowest (79%). Considerably more women (4.2 million) than men (2.8 million) have never used the internet. When broken down by age, the figures suggest almost all - 99% - of 16-24-year-olds use the internet. Disconnected elderly At the opposite end of the spectrum, those aged 75 or above are still the most disconnected. But there were promising signs for those looking to increase engagement among the elderly. In 2011, 23.8% of over-75s had accessed the internet, compared with 34.3% now - a increase of 1.6 million people. However, the ONS urged caution over figures relating to the elderly due to smaller sample sizes. Michelle Mitchell, charity director general at Age UK, welcomed the ""fantastic"" news. ""The internet offers huge benefits to people in later life so it is an extremely positive step in ensuring more people can profit from being online,"" she said. ""However, the key is not just getting people online for the first time but giving them the skills and knowledge to become confident using the internet. ""With more services heading online, with the aim of potentially saving the government millions, the government must invest in greater training to open up the web to all."" As in previous years, disability and low income still remain serious barriers to getting online. Disabled people were three times less likely to get online than people without disability, the ONS said, with 3.7 million disabled adults not connected.","More than seven million adults in the UK have never used the internet, figures suggest."
"By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter Of the top 30 constituencies - areas where 90% or more of premises have speeds of 30Mbps (megabits per second) or higher - 16 are Labour-controlled. But 17 of the bottom 30 constituencies - those with only half or fewer premises having superfast broadband - are run by Conservative councils. The map was drawn up by broadband news website ThinkBroadband. Liberal Democrat- controlled constituencies had a similar number at both the top and bottom of the league - five in the top 30 and eight in the bottom 30. ""It is interesting that so many Labour seats are towards the top end of the chart,"" said founder of ThinkBroadband Andrew Ferguson. ""A lot of this is because Labour seats tend to be in urban areas while Conservative ones tend to control more rural seats."" The map looks at coverage across the UK's 650 constituencies - which, on average, have about 50,000 premises - homes and businesses. The map throws up huge contrasts between areas that are close to each other. For example, in Wales the constituency of Carmarthen West has 33% of premises with super-fast broadband, compared with just 9.5% in neighbouring Carmarthen East. Many of the constituencies in Hull show fairly low levels of superfast broadband, even though much of the broadband rollout is controlled by Kingston Communications which is offering homes extremely fast fibre-to-the-home technology. ""Kingston Communications has done a lot of fibre-to-the-home broadband but that technology is slower to roll out and so the total coverage is less,"" said Mr Ferguson. It is important to note that the data does not allow anyone to draw conclusions about whether one political party is better than another when it comes to broadband policies, he said. ""The UK telecoms market is amazingly diverse and it is impossible to credit any one single political party for the success or otherwise with respect to what services are available as the current situation is the result of some 30 years of regulation,"" he told the BBC. But local MPs can exert influence, he added. ""What individual politicians can do and should ensure is that those in their constituency are not placed at a significant disadvantage, this could be through ensuring a local authority project covers an area through to ensuring that alternate operators have minimal hurdles to overcome to provide a much-needed service."" Digital manifestos All the main parties have included broadband pledges in their manifestos. Labour have promised affordable, high-speed broadband across the country by 2020 while the Conservatives pledged to continue with their plans to provide 95% of the UK with superfast broadband by 2017. The Liberal Democrat approach reflects the broadband delivery programme currently in motion and which it helped to create. It can be difficult to extrapolate what will happen based on election pledges, said Mr Ferguson. ""They all make promises but there is little detail on how they will do it. ""Whoever gets into power, nothing much will change in the plans up to 2017. And after that, broadly they all want the same thing - to get to almost universal access eventually,"" he said.","Labour-controlled constituencies are more likely to have faster broadband, new data suggests."
"The 3DS LL, which will be known as the XL outside Japan, will have displays that are almost twice as big as those on the current version. It will be priced at 18,900 yen (£150) in Japan and $199.99 (£128) in the US. No European prices have been given. The 3DS faces growing competition from smartphones, tablets and Sony's Playstation Vita handheld. The gadget will go on sale in Japan and Europe from 28 July but will not reach the US until 19 August. Screens on the 3DS LL will be 4.88in (124mm) and 4.18in (106mm) across as compared to 3.53in (90mm) and 3.02in (77mm) in the older model. The larger size of the gadget will also mean it has a longer battery life. For 3D games, the device should run for more than six hours between recharges. For 2D games it should last up to 10 hours. About 17 million 3DS devices have been sold since the device was released in 2011 In April, Nintendo reported its first annual loss as sales of its Wii console and other gadgets started to slow. It has hopes that a revamped games console, the Wii U, will return it to profitability.

"By Zoe KleinmanTechnology reporter, BBC News It set up a wire in the Amazon rainforest to capture new 360-degree images of the trees from root to tip. The round Trekker camera, which weighs 40lb (18kg), has 15 lenses and takes photos every 2.5 seconds. It is usually worn by a walker with a backpack. It reached speeds of 100 km/h (62 mph) on the zip wire from the treetops to the jungle floor, the firm said. The new images have been released on Google Maps. Google began photographing the Amazon in 2010, when it put 12 Trekkers on boats and sailed them up two of the river's main tributaries, the Rio Aripuana and Rio Madeira. The photography project is a collaboration with the Amazonas Sustainable Foundation (FAS). ""Most people won't go to a rainforest in their lifetimes,"" said Google spokesperson Laurian Clemence. ""We also hope environmentalists will use it as a tool to go and see what's there."" In 2009 UK Dr Julian Bayliss discovered a hidden forest in the mountains of northern Mozambique using Google Maps. When he and a research team visited it, they found lots of previously unrecorded wildlife. ""Whatever we see we pick up, and there's a high probability that it's going to be a new species,"" he told the BBC at the time.",Google has flown one of its Street View cameras down a zip wire for the first time.
"The United States alleges that he conspired with Chelsea Manning to access classified information on Department of Defense computers. He could be jailed for up to five years. Since it launched in 2006, Wikileaks has become renowned for publishing thousands of classified documents covering everything from the film industry to national security and wars. The helicopter attack In 2010, Wikileaks published a video from a US military helicopter showing the killing of civilians in Baghdad, Iraq. A voice on the transmission urged the pilots to ""light 'em all up"" and the individuals on the street were fired at from the helicopter. When a van arrived on the scene to pick up the wounded, it too was fired at. Reuters photographer Namir Noor-Eldeen and his assistant Saeed Chmagh were both killed in the attack. US Army Intelligence Wikileaks has published hundreds of thousands of documents leaked by former US Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning. Documents relating to the war in Afghanistan revealed how the US military had killed hundreds of civilians in unreported incidents. Further documents from the Iraq war revealed that 66,000 civilians had been killed - more than previously reported. The documents also showed that prisoners had been tortured by Iraqi forces. Among the leaks were more than 250,000 messages sent by US diplomats. They revealed that the US wanted to collect ""biographic and biometric"" information - including iris scans, DNA samples and fingerprints - of key officials at the UN. 9/11 pager messages About 573,000 intercepted pager messages sent during the 9/11 terror attacks in the United States were published by Wikileaks. The messages include families checking up on their loved ones and government departments reacting to the attacks. ""President has been rerouted won't be returning to Washington but not sure where he will go,"" one message said. Democrat emails Wikileaks published thousands of hacked emails from the account of Hillary Clinton's campaign boss John Podesta, in the run-up to the US presidential election in 2016. In the emails, Mr Podesta called Mrs Clinton's election rival Bernie Sanders a ""doofus"" for criticising the Paris climate change agreement. The emails also suggested that a CNN contributor tipped off the Clinton campaign about a question that was going to be asked during a debate hosted by the broadcaster. The timing of the leaks led to accusations that Wikileaks was deliberately trying to discredit Mrs Clinton. The site also published leaked information from Republican Sarah Palin's Yahoo email accounts in 2008. British National Party members In 2008, Wikileaks published the names, addresses and contact information of more than 13,000 members of the British National Party. The political party's manifesto proposed banning immigration from Muslim countries and encouraging some UK residents to return to ""their lands of ethnic origin"". A former member was later fined £200 for the leak. The Sony Pictures hack A leak of more than 170,000 emails and 20,000 documents from movie studio Sony Pictures was published on Wikileaks in 2015. The entertainment company suffered a cyber-attack weeks before releasing The Interview, a film that poked fun at North Korea. The emails revealed that actresses Jennifer Lawrence and Amy Adams received a lower fee than their male co-stars in American Hustle. There were also messages from producers and executives insulting celebrities such as Angelina Jolie. Leonardo DiCaprio was called ""despicable"" for turning down a role in a Sony Pictures film. Mr Assange said the emails were in the public interest because they showed the inner working of a multinational company and were ""at the centre of a geo-political conflict"".","Wikileaks founder Julian Assange was arrested on Thursday at Ecuador's London embassy, where he had been granted asylum since 2012."
"Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent@BBCRoryCJon Twitter That data centre has now been retrieved from the ocean floor, and Microsoft researchers are assessing how it has performed, and what they can learn from it about energy efficiency. No humans, few failures Their first conclusion is that the cylinder packed with servers had a lower failure rate than a conventional data centre. When the container was hauled off the seabed around half a mile offshore after being placed there in May 2018, just eight out of the 855 servers on board had failed. That compares very well with a conventional data centre. ""Our failure rate in the water is one-eighth of what we see on land,"" says Ben Cutler, who has led what Microsoft calls Project Natick. The team is speculating that the greater reliability may be connected to the fact that there were no humans on board, and that nitrogen rather than oxygen was pumped into the capsule. ""We think it has to do with this nitrogen atmosphere that reduces corrosion and is cool, and people not banging things around,"" Mr Cutler says. Orkney was chosen for the trial by Microsoft, partly because it was a centre for renewable energy research in a place where the climate was temperate - perhaps even chilly. The idea was that the cost of cooling computers would be lower if they were under water. The white cylinder emerged from the cold waters with a coating of algae, barnacles and sea anemones after a day-long operation. But inside, the data centre was functioning well - and is now being closely examined so that the research team can learn more. As more and more of our data is stored in the cloud, there is growing concern about the vast energy demands of data centres. Reliably green Project Natick was partly about working out whether clusters of small underwater data centres for short-term use might be a commercial proposition, but also an attempt to learn broader lessons about energy efficiency in cloud computing. All of Orkney's electricity comes from wind and solar power, but there were no issues in keeping the underwater data centre supplied with power. ""We have been able to run really well on what most land-based data centres consider an unreliable grid,"" says Spencer Fowers, one of the technical team on Project Natick. ""We are hopeful that we can look at our findings and say maybe we don't need to have quite as much infrastructure focused on power and reliability."" Underwater data centres might sound an outlandish idea. But David Ross, who has been a consultant to the data centre industry for many years, says the project has great potential. He believes organisations facing a natural disaster or a terrorist attack might find it attractive: ""You could effectively move something to a more secure location without having all the huge infrastructure costs of constructing a building. It's flexible and cost effective."" Microsoft is cautious about saying when an underwater data centre might be a commercial product, but is confident that it has proved the idea has value. ""We think that we're past the point where this is a science experiment,"" says Ben Cutler. ""Now it's simply a question of what do we want to engineer - would it be a little one, or would it be a large one?"" The experiment on Orkney is over. But the hope is that the result will be more environmentally friendly data storage, both on land and under water.","Two years ago, Microsoft sank a data centre off the coast of Orkney in a wild experiment."
"The distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack was said to have targeted servers responsible for sites with a "".cn"" domain name. The country has not speculated on who may be responsible. DDoS attacks, in which a target is flooded with traffic in an attempt to render it unreachable, are common. The technique is typically employed by hacktivists looking to disrupt websites from operating correctly. Enhanced capabilities Notice of the attack was posted on the website of the China Internet Network Information Center (CNNIC). It said that the DDoS had begun at 02:00 local time on Sunday - before intensifying at 04:00. The CNNIC apologised to the affected users. It said it would ""enhance the service capabilities"" of the network responsible for the affected domains. China is often accused of being responsible for major attacks on Western countries, particularly the US. A New York Times investigation claimed that China had targeted their systems over a four-month period - but the Chinese foreign ministry described the accusation as ""groundless"".","China has said it has suffered its ""biggest ever"" cyber-attack, causing many websites based in the country to go temporarily offline."
"Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent@BBCRoryCJon Twitter On the Tech Tent podcast this week, we talk to two women who have been on the receiving end of that kind of behaviour and ask why the culture of Silicon Valley appears to be stuck in the last century. We also discuss a week that has seen the demise of the internal combustion engine come closer - as Volvo announced that all its cars will soon include an electric motor - and we meet the woman who has a powerful role in regulating Facebook and other tech giants in Europe. Tech's Problem With Women You might think that California was among the most liberal, even politically correct, places on Earth. But tell that to women in the technology industry. We knew how few women there were at senior levels in tech companies - and the situation is even worse at the venture capital firms that fund them. Now we are finding out just why they may find it difficult to thrive. This week has seen the latest in a series of scandals that have underlined something deeply wrong with the culture of Silicon Valley. Dave McClure, the co-founder of 500 Startups, an important and powerful figure in the funding of small tech firms, resigned after accusations that he had sexually harassed a female entrepreneur. Then another woman came forward with similar allegations. Malaysian tech entrepreneur Cheryl Yeoh posted an account on her website of a brainstorming evening with Mr McClure and a group of other people in her apartment, which ended with him proposing that they should sleep together and pushing her against a wall to demand a kiss. On our programme, Ms Yeoh gives her first interview about her story, telling Zoe Kleinman she did not confront Mr McClure after the incident, afraid of what it might mean for her business and the deal she was trying to strike with him. ""If I had told him how angry I was at the time, he might have pulled the deal off."" We've contacted Mr McClure about the allegations but have not heard back from him so far. We also talk to one of the most prominent women in Silicon Valley, Danae Ringelmann, co-founder of the crowdfunding site Indiegogo. She tells us of her own experience of sexual harassment, when a drunken entrepreneur groped her at a post-conference party. She says there was not the same power imbalance as in Ms Yeoh's case - she wasn't seeking funding from the entrepreneur - but she still thought long and hard about reporting the incident. ""I've had the same type of concerns as other women - do I say something and risk hurting my company or do I shut up?"" In recent weeks, more women have felt emboldened to tell their stories about sexual harassment and other forms of discrimination. Silicon Valley's cool liberal image is under threat - and the pressure is growing to do something about it. The Electric Future Will we look back one day and say this was the week when the electric car's time finally arrived? At a press conference in Sweden's capital Stockholm this week, Volvo Cars announced that from 2019 all its new models will be fully or partly electric-powered. On Friday, the first Tesla Model 3 - the electric car-maker's first mass-market model - rolls off the production line. And France has announced that by 2040, cars that use petrol or diesel will be banned from its roads. But reaching a time when the internal combustion engine can take its place in a museum rather than on the road may still prove a long and complex journey. For the mass of motorists, electric cars are still much too pricey a proposition. Of nearly 250,000 cars sold in the UK last year, fewer than 11,000 were electric or hybrid vehicles. Then there is the infrastructure needed to make electric cars a practical choice. For someone like me who lives in a terraced house, the idea of stretching an extension cable across the pavement to power my car does not appeal. Until there are charging points on every street and a network of fast-charging stations across the country, many motorists will say no to electric. Rachel Burgess from Autocar magazine tells the programme that Volvo's pledge may not be quite as dramatic as it appears - all carmakers have signed up to reducing the carbon emissions of their fleet and quite a lot of its cars will be what are called 48v mild hybrids, mostly powered by petrol or diesel rather than a small electric motor. Still, the electric car now has momentum, and we can expect to see further announcements from major carmakers who want to seem in tune with the future. Ireland's Data Overlord It's a small country geographically on the fringe of Europe, but Republic of Ireland wields great power when it comes to regulating America's tech giants. That is because many of them - and notably Facebook - have their European headquarters there, and that means that Ireland's Data Protection Commissioner Helen Dixon can change the way they operate in the EU. She tells Tech Tent that American firms are learning they have to shape their policies to a European view of data privacy. One example: she has told Facebook that it can't use the facial recognition technology it applies in the United States in Europe. She also feels that European consumers are becoming less accepting of the bargain where we get free services from the American tech giants in return for being tracked. Ever noticed that a pair of trainers can seem to follow you around the internet if you've searched for them once? Ms Dixon tells us that this phenomenon is irritating more and more people: ""They want to know why it is that you're serving me these ads."" This week the UK's data protection regulator, the Information Commissioner, criticised an NHS hospital for the way it handed over patient data to Google's DeepMind division without many checks. Ms Dixon says these kind of deals that see public bodies collaborate with the tech giants will come in for closer scrutiny and regulators will ask some key questions: ""What's the transparency to the public? Do they understand that the data is being shared and what are the purpose and benefits?"" In May next year, Europe's new data protection law, the GDPR, comes into force. That will mean every organisation, large or small, has to be much more careful about how it shares data across borders - and it will make regulators like Ms Dixon even more powerful.","Silicon Valley and the wider tech industry have a problem with women. At least, that is what you might conclude after a week that has seen a leading tech investor resign after admitting his involvement in sexual harassment."
"By Leo KelionTechnology reporter Since cutting ties with the firm in 2010 he's set up Nest - a smart-thermostat that looks like nothing else on the market. But let's put his achievements aside for a moment and pinch-and-zoom into the ousting of a man portrayed as his nemesis: Scott Forstall. In 2011 Businessweek magazine ran an article which said the two men had repeatedly clashed at Apple with Mr Forstall - the iPhone software chief - raiding his colleague's team for talent, creating an ""explosive"" climate in which the two argued over credit, attention and resources before Mr Fadell ultimately quit. So what does he make of the news that Mr Forstall lost his post in October after reports of rifts with other executives and a refusal to apologise for the release of a flawed Maps app. ""Scott got what he deserved,"" Mr Fadell told the BBC. When pressed, he adds: ""I think what happened just a few weeks back was deserved and justified and it happened."" So where does that leave Apple and the shares he still holds in it? ""If you read some of the reports, people were cheering in Cupertino when that event happened,"" he answers, referring to Apple headquarters in California. ""So, I think Apple is in a great space, it has great products and there are amazing people at the company, and those people actually have a chance to have a firm footing now and continue the legacy Steve [Jobs] left."" Leadership rumours One Wall Street analyst found these comments telling, bearing in mind both Mr Fadell and Mr Forstall had once been tipped as successors to Steve Jobs. ""If you are the head of a major success, which both of these people were, of course you would be considered as a candidate to lead the company,"" says Colin Gillis, senior technology analyst at BGC Partners. ""The reality is in any organisation there is more disruption and tension than people realise from a distance and it's coming out more clearly now after the departure of Forstall. ""For an investor this is an important kind of thing to watch out for. There have been important changes of leadership and tone at Apple... Jobs, Forstall and Fadell were behind its most disruptive recent products, but [industrial design boss] Jony Ive is still there, and he's the one investors are now watching."" Apple said Mr Forstall - who remains its ""special advisor"" until next year - was not available for comment. Working for Jobs Mr Fadell himself says the decision to shift part of Mr Forstall's responsibilities to Mr Ive means that Apple's software design is now in ""good hands"". And he has even warmer words for his ex-boss, describing his nine years working with Mr Jobs as one of the most important relationships of his life. He adds that the experience taught him a lesson that he has tried to put into practice at Nest: success is about much more than a good product. ""It's about every touchpoint where the consumer interacts with the brand,"" he explains. ""Whether that's at learning about the product, buying the product, using it, servicing it, unboxing the product - all of those places are consumer touchpoints and you need to look at those in as much detail as you do the product-user interactions."" Mr Fadell says it was true that Mr Job's high standards meant no-one at Apple could ever relax around him, but he was happy to bust some myths. He says the idea of the iPhone having a click-wheel to make calls was ""never going to really happen"". Although the idea was briefly explored, he says it was obvious within a couple of months that a touchscreen was the better option. And he laughs when asked about the much-repeated story that Mr Jobs dropped a prototype iPod into water, saw bubbles come out and said it proved the device could be shrunk further. ""It's so funny,"" Mr Fadell says. ""That story is about Sony products back in the 70s and the 80s. That was actually the Sony CEO at the time doing those things, not Steve."" Smart heating There was a lot of speculation about what Mr Fadell would do after leaving Apple. No-one guessed he would release a thermostat. He describes himself as having ""stumbled"" on the idea after exploring eco-friendly products and discovering such devices controlled half or more of the average home's energy bill. His device, Nest, features a crisp, minimalist graphical readout surrounded by a metallic band and aims to ""learn"" how to save energy by studying owners' habits. Perhaps unsurprisingly it can be adjusted remotely by a smartphone app. It went on sale in the US and Canada last year. Teething problems followed. Manufacturing costs proved too high and about 25% of homes found their boilers and/or air conditioner systems proved incompatible. Mr Fadell says both issues have since been resolved. He says his current focus is to launch Nest in 63 countries, including the UK, but proves reticent about speculating what he might develop next. More connected household devices would be an obvious bet, but he mocks the idea of an internet-linked kettle or toaster, saying he can't see the point. Kicking crowdfunding Mr Fadell becomes more revealing when asked about other tech innovations trying to get off the ground, with some critical words for big projects that rely on Kickstarter or other crowdfunding sites. ""For the public to think that these products - once they have an interesting CAD [computer-aided design] rendering and maybe an interesting video that they quickly cooked up - that these products will actually see the light of day any time soon - I think that's a disservice to how hard it is to make the kinds of things that make a difference,"" he says. ""Anyone can make a housewares item that has no electronics in it, but something that is truly intricate and with lots of digital hardware and software and customer service and support, it is very difficult to pull off a business like that."" He adds that he has helped fund about half a dozen small projects, including a cardboard robot and a movie - but urges entrepreneurs with more ambitious ideas to realise the benefit of giving up a stake in their business to bring venture capitalists or private equity firms on board. ""[It] allows small teams to go through the real financing and real management routes that are imposed through private investment,"" he adds. Before he leaves there's just time for one more question. Having developed a click wheel for Apple and more recently a rotating bezel to control Nest, is he sad to see such an interface ditched from recent iPods in favour of touchscreens? He stumbles for a second and then says: ""You kind of fall in love with certain things over time. But you can see how other substitutes work as well or even better. ""Do I have melancholy for that? Absolutely. But do I miss it - not really.""","Tony Fadell is one of Silicon Valley's biggest names. He's known as the ""father of the iPod"" for his work on the first 18 generations of Apple's music player and was also involved in the hardware design of the original iPhone."
"By Cristina CriddleTechnology reporter It said any videos that contradict expert consensus from local health authorities, such as the NHS or World Health Organization, will be removed. It follows an announcement by Facebook that it would ban ads that discourage people from getting vaccinated. However, that restriction will not apply to unpaid posts or comments. YouTube had already banned ""medically unsubstantiated"" claims relating to coronavirus on its platform. But it is now explicitly expanding the policy to include content relating to vaccines. 'Imminent vaccine' ""A Covid-19 vaccine may be imminent, therefore we're ensuring we have the right policies in place to be able to remove [related] misinformation,"" the Google-owned service said in a statement. It said it would remove any suggestions that the vaccine would: YouTube said it had already removed 200,000 dangerous or misleading videos about the virus since February. False claims Facebook's new policy is designed to stop it facing accusations of profiting from the spread of anti-vaccination messages. The social network had previously allowed ads to express opposition to vaccines if they did not contain false claims. It said the new rules would be enforced ""over the next few days"", but some ads would still run in the meantime. It added that it was launching a campaign to provide users information about the flu vaccine, including where to get flu shots in the US. ""Our goal is to help messages about the safety and efficacy of vaccines reach a broad group of people, while prohibiting ads with misinformation that could harm public health efforts,"" the company blogged. Anti-vaccination groups will still be allowed on its platform. Unpaid posts or comments that discourage people from getting a vaccination are also still permitted. Earlier in the year, Facebook's public policy manager Jason Hirsch told Reuters the company believed users should be able to express personal anti-vaccine views. He said that more aggressive censorship could push people hesitant about vaccines towards the anti-vaccine camp. The subsequent change is one of many that have recently been made to its free speech principles. On Monday, Facebook banned posts denying the Holocaust, following years of pressure. And last week it also banned content related to the QAnon conspiracy theory ahead of the US election. Political pressure The moves come as the UK government faced renewed criticism over the amount of time it is taking to pass a new law to tackle online misinformation and other issues involving the social media giants. The chair of the Department of Culture, Media and Sport Committee Julian Knight said that delays to passing the Online Harms Bill were ""unjustifiable"" and attacked the government for failing to empower a regulator to handle related complaints, Ministers have previously suggested Ofcom take on the role, but have yet to confirm the appointment. The culture secretary Oliver Dowden was questioned by the committee about the bill. He said draft legislation would be published in 2021, and added it should include ""tough penalties"" for those who break the rules. But one expert raised concern that the tech companies would be left to self-regulate themselves in the meantime. ""The volume of content defined as misinformation overrides the number of employees to oversee such things, or [the automated] functionalities the platforms have,"" said Unsah Malik, a social media advisor. ""We should probably have stronger consequences for those who publish misinformation - make it unlawful and fine people."" As the possibility of a coronavirus vaccine edges closer, disinformation and conspiracy theories surrounding it increasingly circulate on social media. That includes everything from false claims that a vaccine is a tool for mass genocide to baseless conspiracy theories about Bill Gates micro-chipping the world population. For that reason, moves taken by YouTube and Facebook will be welcomed. Social media sites were widely criticised for not acting quickly enough to tackle health misinformation early on in the pandemic - and many will be reassured they're looking ahead. But an entirely different question is how well these new measures will be enforced, how effective they will prove to be - and whether they could be too late. Vaccine disinformation has thrived in large Facebook groups and YouTube videos from notorious pseudoscientists for months now. And it has spilled over into parent chats and community forums. It's that gradual exposure to conspiracy theory content that could sow seeds of doubt in the minds of many about a coronavirus vaccine. Plus this disinformation undermines legitimate concerns that any available vaccine is safe and properly approved.",YouTube has pledged to delete misleading claims about coronavirus vaccines as part of a fresh effort to tackle Covid-19 misinformation.
"Analysis of the LSE site suggests that over the last 90 days, about 363 pages had hosted malware. The LSE said its site was now safe and an investigation showed that ads provided by a third party were the culprit. One victim claimed his PC was made unusable after being infected. Security expert Paul Mutton fell victim when he viewed the site on 27 February. He visited the LSE homepage to find out why some people reported that they could not access it. The site was blocked by Firefox, he said, but accessible via Google's Chrome browser. ""It seemed to work with Chrome but then a few seconds later, without having to click on anything, pop-ups started to appear,"" he said. The malicious code closed down several of the programs Mr Mutton was using and stopped new ones being started. ""I visited the site and it compromised my machine,"" said Mr Mutton. While he was fighting to regain control of his machine, the malware kicked off fake virus alerts in pop-up windows. One window was a fake security scanner which claimed it had detected lots of different malware on the PC. Mr Mutton said his machine fell victim despite being updated with the latest batch of virus definitions earlier in the day. Bad ads Analysis of the LSE homepage by Google's safe browsing scheme, which scans web pages for malicious code, found the site had been listed for ""suspicious activity 6 time(s) over the past 90 days"". The last time it discovered malicious activity on the site was on 27 February, the day Mr Mutton visited. Of the 1112 pages that Google scanned on the LSE site over the last 90 days, 363 were found to be hosting malware. The malicious code it found included scripting exploits and trojans. Graham Cluley, senior technology consultant at security firm Sophos, said: ""Our suspicion would be that it was the third-party advertising network running via the site that delivered the malware."" ""This so-called 'malvertising' is big business for cyber criminals,"" said Mr Cluley. ""If they are able to plant their poisonous adverts in the streams being used by major websites then it can spread their attacks far and wide,"" he said. While many sites rely on third-parties to provide adverts, that can have its risks, said Mr Cluley. ""Unfortunately when an infection does get through it's likely that the users will blame the website, not the ad network,"" he said.",Booby-trapped adverts that hit visitors with fake security software have been discovered on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) website.
"By Richard WestcottBBC Transport Correspondent The proposed new high-speed rail line, HS2, is due to slice right through Fred Moreton's 550-acre farm near Offchurch, Warwickshire. And last week, he finally had his chance to tell MPs on the High Speed Rail Bill Select Committee just how this titanic building project would upend his life. Fred brought along slides for them to see. The thick black line is his land and all the green will be taken up by the railway. He didn't want the line at all, he told them, but if it had to be built, he wanted it in a tunnel so it didn't destroy his business. We were in the slightly jaded, but still grand, Committee Room Five in the House of Commons. The room is as high as it's wide, all portraits and rickety chairs with the Commons logo on the back. Fred was up against two lawyers from HS2. The cost of such a tunnel, they explained to MPs, would be £190m. Fred told me later that the first HS2 estimate he'd been given was for £80m. ""All the details keep changing,"" he said. At the back of the room, 20 or so other people, all of them affected by the proposed line, patiently waited their turn. There were plenty of quiet little ""good lucks"" and ""you did wells"" as the day wore on. Nuts and bolts After all the big rows, we're down to the nitty-gritty of how you actually get a gigantic, hugely contentious thing built in Britain. A piece of legislation called a Hybrid Bill is being put before the committee of MPs. Think of it as planning permission for phase one of the line - the route between London and Birmingham. It's an inch-by-inch summary of exactly where it will go and how it will be built. And this is the forensic scrutiny that takes place before the final version of the Bill goes before all MPs for a vote, probably next year. If they say yes, the line seems certain to be built. If they reject it, well.... Forget arguments about economics and rail capacity. This is about ordinary people, often living in peaceful villages, who are worried about how their narrow country lanes will cope with all the HGVs and diggers that could soon be appearing in their backyards. They're worried about the school kids who walk along those lanes every day without a path to keep them safe. They're worried their businesses will go bust. Traffic, waste, noise The High Speed Rail Bill Select Committee is made up of six MPs, who'll eventually spend around 18 months listening to 2,000 or so people and groups directly affected by the project. From what I saw, their attention to detail was impressive as they drilled down into the whys and wherefores of moving a path here, a lorry route there. Every so often they go on site visits. At one point they joked with a petitioner about how good her biscuits had been when they visited her. She'd been impressed that she got her tin back afterwards. During my brief dip into the committee process, petitioner 1126, Joanna Wilson, representing Aston le Walls Parish Council, told the MPs her colleagues just wanted to make the best of a bad situation. They even charged HS2 to use their village hall and used the money to set up a film club for the locals. If the lorries are going the wrong way through the village, others wanted to know, who should they complain to? HS2 said they would establish helplines. Petitioner 618, Ken Christy, from the village of Sulgrave in Northamptonshire, brought along nine slides to show how his bucolic existence would be spoilt. He was worried about traffic, waste, noise. 'Forget the way it looks' We also saw how the tracks will plough through the hamlet of Lower Thorpe Mandeville on a 200m-long viaduct. Maurice Cole (petitioner 434) asked the committee to consider a much higher sound barrier - 4m rather than the 1.4m currently planned. Locals don't mind having a big, ugly barrier near their village, he said. ""Forget the way it looks. Everyone's biggest concern is noise."" Maurice brought along slides showing a bin lorry squeezing down the local lane. There's no room for HGVs, he said, especially on the 300m stretch that has no footpath but is frequented by children and horse riders. To the surprise of many, HS2 agreed and said they'd look at a different route for lorries. During my visit, everyone I asked said they were happy with the way they were treated and grateful for the chance to get their point across. But no-one was convinced it would do much good. Covering this story, one of the most common complaints I hear from people is about the lack of information and the lack of someone to talk to about what is actually going to happen to their homes, villages and communities. The committee can't stop the project, but they can recommend changes - from tunnels to route alterations. The problem is that such changes cost money and could add millions to the final bill.

"Users will have access to programmes broadcast over the previous week from the BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel Five, as well as the ability to pause and rewind live TV. The project had originally been scheduled to begin in 2010. Some analysts have said the delay might have harmed its prospects. Lord Sugar, the project's non-executive chairman, showed off a set-top box made by Humax which will allow users to access the service. He said it would cost £299, but added that he would not be surprised if that fell to £99 in a couple of years. It is being made available in two ways: Sky has said it would add its Now TV product offering access to movies, sport and entertainment at a later date. STV, Scotland's ITV franchise, also plans to offer on-demand content soon. Opportunities YouView was first announced in 2008 when it was called Project Canvas. It offers access to more than 100 digital TV and radio channels - some of which are in high definition. YouView said a further 300 content providers have expressed interest in joining the system. They include Amazon's Lovefilm service which has announced that TalkTalk subscribers would get 12 months access to its movie and television library. Some industry watchers have said that the subsequent launch of smart TVs with similar features may weigh on demand. However, Ian Watt from Enders Analysis added that it should still help the ISPs involved, giving them another tool to discourage customers switching to rival's all-in-one packages. ""I'd say it's better late than never,"" he told the BBC. ""For players in the telecoms space such as BT this move represents an attempt to level the playing field with Sky and Virgin Media. ""They can piggyback the success of Freeview and offer lower cost entry points into the pay-TV market, providing an opportunity to attract more subscribers than they had been able to do with products such as BT Vision."" BT recently agreed to pay £738m for 114 Premier League football matches across three seasons from 2013. Analysts have suggested the firm needs to treble its number of TV subscribers if it is to break even. Technical limitations The initial Humax box does not include wi-fi meaning some customers may need to buy additional equipment if they do not have wired internet connections in the same rooms as TVs they wish to attach. ""Anything that comes along requiring extra bits and pieces at extra expense is going slow penetration into the market,"" said Paul O'Donovan, principal research analyst at tech consultants Gartner. ""It's a great mistake that they haven't integrated wi-fi into the hardware at this stage. The future is all about integrating handheld devices such as smartphones and tablets with a TV and you can't do that without a wireless connection. ""This gives Sky, Virgin and the Smart TV markers an opportunity to stay ahead for the foreseeable future.""",YouView - an internet TV service that combines the UK's Freeview channels with on-demand content - has been formally launched.
"In a statement, development studio Valve, which runs Steam, said ""high fees and volatility"" had driven it to stop accepting them. It said that fees to process Bitcoin payments had ""skyrocketed"" in 2017, making the virtual currency much less attractive as an option. It said it may re-evaluate Bitcoin as a payment possibility in the future. Losing loop In its statement, Valve said although Bitcoin had always been volatile, the rapid changes in value it had seen during the past few months had been ""extreme"". Steam started accepting payments in bitcoins in April this year. At that time, each Bitcoin was worth about $450 (£335). Now, each coin is worth about $14,800. The moment-by-moment shifts in value were a problem, Valve said, because of the narrow window customers had to complete a purchase using bitcoins. If a Bitcoin-based transaction was prolonged, the value of the coins being transferred could change ""significantly"", it said. In these cases, customers had to transfer more bitcoins to make the payment, or get a refund. And either option would result in the customer paying more exchange fees, currently about $20. Some customers adding bitcoins had even been caught out a second time as the value changed again. ""This year, we've seen increasing number of customers get into this state,"" Valve said. Bitcoin continued to rise in value this week and looks set to break the $15,000 barrier soon. Valve's decision comes as crypto-cash mining market NiceHash reported a ""security breach"" had meant hackers had accessed its Bitcoin wallet, which had contained about $60m in bitcoins.",Online game service Steam has stopped accepting payments made with the Bitcoin virtual currency.
"Dave LeeNorth America technology reporter The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said an “inadequate safety culture” at Uber was also a major contributing factor. As too were poor, or in some cases non-existent, rules governing firms testing self-driving technology. The findings follow a near two-year investigation. In a hearing to discuss the results, the NTSB urged national regulators to create a more thorough review process before the technology can be used on public roads. Elaine Herzberg, 49, was killed when an Uber-owned self-driving car - operating in autonomous mode - struck her as she crossed a road in Tempe, Arizona, on 18 March 2018. In the car was safety driver Rafaela Vasquez who, according to investigators, had been streaming a TV show on her mobile phone while behind the wheel. Dashcam footage showed Ms Vasquez spent 36% of the journey that evening looking at the device. In its experiments with driverless cars, Uber has mandated that a human operator pays attention at all times so they can take over in difficult situations or when the vehicle encounters a situation it does not know how to handle. ""Had the vehicle operator been attentive, she would likely have had sufficient time to detect and react to the crossing pedestrian to avoid the crash or mitigate the impact,"" the NTSB ruled. Uber’s computers detected Ms Herzberg 5.6 seconds before impact, the NTSB said, but did not correctly identify her as a person. The report said Ms Herzberg was acting unsafely in attempting to cross the road where she did - investigators said toxicology reports suggested she had taken drugs that may have impaired her judgement. Nevertheless, the NTSB said Uber had an ""inadequate safety culture, exhibited by a lack of risk assessment mechanisms, of oversight of vehicle operators, and of personnel with backgrounds in safety management”. It acknowledged on Tuesday that the company had made significant changes since the accident. Uber said it welcomed the recommendations. ""We deeply regret the March 2018 crash that resulted in the loss of Elaine Herzberg’s life, and we remain committed to improving the safety of our self-driving program,” said Nat Beuse, head of safety at Uber’s advanced technologies group. “Over the last 20 months, we have provided the NTSB with complete access to information about our technology and the developments we have made since the crash. While we are proud of our progress, we will never lose sight of what brought us here or our responsibility to continue raising the bar on safety.” _____ Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC Do you have more information about this or any other technology story?

"Dave LeeNorth America technology reporter If a reader chooses to block its advertising, US publication Salon will use that person's computer to mine for Monero, a cryptocurrency similar to Bitcoin. Creating new tokens of a cryptocurrency typically requires complex calculations that use up a lot of computing power. Salon told readers: ""We intend to use a small percentage of your spare processing power to contribute to the advancement of technological discovery, evolution and innovation."" The site is making use of CoinHive, a controversial mining tool that was recently used in an attack involving government websites in the UK, US and elsewhere. However, unlike that incident, where hackers took control of visitors' computers to mine cryptocurrency, Salon notifies users and requires them to agree before the tool begins mining. ""I've opted-in to Salon's new revenue model using Coinhive,"" wrote security researcher Troy Mursch. ""100% of my CPU [central processing unit] is now used by them to mine cryptocurrency. As my computer slows to crawl and quickly begins to heat up, I struggle to navigate their website.""

Several publications have experimented with ways around this, the most successful being complete paywalls - where users must pay a subscription to access the site - or metered systems where after a certain number of articles are accessed, the user must pay to carry on reading. News site Wired predicted that around 20% of its readers accessed the site using ad blockers, and so restricted the number of articles those readers saw unless Wired was added to a whitelist that would let advertising through.",News organisations have tried many novel ways to make readers pay - but this idea is possibly the most audacious yet.
"Protesting his innocence, Mr McAfee said via his blog that he had gone into hiding following police ""harassment"". Belize police said Mr McAfee was a ""person of interest"" in the murder of Florida businessman Gregory Faull. The authorities said they wanted to talk to him to help investigate the circumstances surrounding the death. Mr Faull was found dead of a single gunshot to the head on 11 November. His Belize home sits next to the compound Mr McAfee maintains, on a tropical island. Mr Faull is known to have had a long-running row with Mr McAfee about the multi-millionaire fugitive's dogs. On his blog, Mr McAfee said he was writing to publicise the treatment he had received at the hands of the police in Belize. Mr McAfee said he had nothing to do with the death of Mr Faull. Belize police said he should come forward to help them track down the killer. Mr McAfee said he was hiding so he could keep an eye on his home and what the police did to investigate Mr Faull's death. To go unnoticed, Mr McAfee revealed that he had changed his appearance by dying his hair and beard, stuck chewed bubble gum to his upper gums to fatten his face and stained his teeth. He said he took these steps so he could stay close to his Belize home and conduct his own investigation into Mr Faull's death, adding that he had little faith that the island's police would find the murderer. ""My safety is contingent on the truth being discovered,"" he wrote. In an interview with US TV station NBC, Mr McAfee offered a reward of $25,000 (£15,700) for the capture of the ""person or persons"" behind the killing. On his blog, Mr McAfee said the blog would continue if he was captured as he had pre-written enough material for about 12 months of entries. In addition, he said, the blog was maintained by a friend, Chad Essley, who is writing and drawing a graphic novel about Mr McAfee's life.",The founder of anti-virus software maker McAfee has gone on the run in Belize following a police investigation into the murder of his neighbour.
"By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter When a ""normal"" algorithm generated by artificial intelligence is asked what it sees in an abstract shape it chooses something cheery: ""A group of birds sitting on top of a tree branch."" Norman sees a man being electrocuted. And where ""normal"" AI sees a couple of people standing next to each other, Norman sees a man jumping from a window. The psychopathic algorithm was created by a team at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, as part of an experiment to see what training AI on data from ""the dark corners of the net"" would do to its world view. The software was shown images of people dying in gruesome circumstances, culled from a group on the website Reddit. Then the AI, which can interpret pictures and describe what it sees in text form, was shown inkblot drawings and asked what it saw in them. These abstract images are traditionally used by psychologists to help assess the state of a patient's mind, in particular whether they perceive the world in a negative or positive light. Norman's view was unremittingly bleak - it saw dead bodies, blood and destruction in every image. Alongside Norman, another AI was trained on more normal images of cats, birds and people. It saw far more cheerful images in the same abstract blots. The fact that Norman's responses were so much darker illustrates a harsh reality in the new world of machine learning, said Prof Iyad Rahwan, part of the three-person team from MIT's Media Lab which developed Norman. ""Data matters more than the algorithm. ""It highlights the idea that the data we use to train AI is reflected in the way the AI perceives the world and how it behaves."" Artificial intelligence is all around us these days - Google recently showed off AI making a phone call with a voice virtually indistinguishable from a human one, while fellow Alphabet firm Deepmind has made algorithms that can teach themselves to play complex games. And AI is already being deployed across a wide variety of industries, from personal digital assistants, email filtering, search, fraud prevention, voice and facial recognition and content classification. It can generate news, create new levels in video games, act as a customer service agent, analyse financial and medical reports and offer insights into how data centres can save energy. But if the experiment with Norman proves anything it is that AI trained on bad data can itself turn bad. Racist AI Norman is biased towards death and destruction because that is all it knows and AI in real-life situations can be equally biased if it is trained on flawed data. In May last year, a report claimed that an AI-generated computer program used by a US court for risk assessment was biased against black prisoners. The program flagged that black people were twice as likely as white people to reoffend, as a result of the flawed information that it was learning from. Predictive policing algorithms used in the US were also spotted as being similarly biased, as a result of the historical crime data on which they were trained. Sometimes the data that AI ""learns"" from comes from humans intent on mischief-making so when Microsoft's chatbat Tay was released on Twitter in 2016, the bot quickly proved a hit with racists and trolls who taught it to defend white supremacists, call for genocide and express a fondness for Hitler. Norman, it seems, is not alone when it comes to easily suggestible AI. And AI hasn't stopped at racism. One study showed that software trained on Google News became sexist as a result of the data it was learning from. When asked to complete the statement, ""Man is to computer programmer as woman is to X"", the software replied 'homemaker"". Dr Joanna Bryson, from the University of Bath's department of computer science said that the issue of sexist AI could be down to the fact that a lot of machines are programmed by ""white, single guys from California"" and can be addressed, at least partially, by diversifying the workforce. She told the BBC it should come as no surprise that machines are picking up the opinions of the people who are training them. ""When we train machines by choosing our culture, we necessarily transfer our own biases,"" she said. ""There is no mathematical way to create fairness. Bias is not a bad word in machine learning. It just means that the machine is picking up regularities."" What she worries about is the idea that some programmers would deliberately choose to hard-bake badness or bias into machines. To stop this, the process of creating AI needs more oversight and greater transparency, she thinks. Prof Rahwan said his experiment with Norman proved that ""engineers have to find a way of balancing data in some way,"" but, he acknowledges the ever-expanding and important world of machine learning cannot be left to the programmers alone. ""There is a growing belief that machine behaviour can be something you can study in the same way as you study human behaviour,"" he said. This new era of ""AI psychology"" would take the form of regular audits of the systems being developed, rather like those that exist in the banking world already, he said. Microsoft's ex-chief envisioning officer Dave Coplin thinks Norman is a great way to start an important conversation with the public and businesses who are coming to rely on AI more and more. It must start, he said, with ""a basic understanding of how these things work"". ""We are teaching algorithms in the same way as we teach human beings so there is a risk that we are not teaching everything right,"" he said. ""When I see an answer from an algorithm, I need to know who made that algorithm,"" he added. ""For example, if I use a tea-making algorithm made in North America then I know I am going to get a splash of milk in some lukewarm water."" From bad tea to dark thoughts about pictures, AI still has a lot to learn but Mr Coplin remains hopeful that, as algorithms become embedded in everything we do, humans will get better at spotting and eliminating bias in the data that feeds them.","Norman is an algorithm trained to understand pictures but, like its namesake Hitchcock's Norman Bates, it does not have an optimistic view of the world."
"By Kim GittlesonBBC reporter, New York The two took had picked a hip event space in Chelsea, New York to launch their latest venture: Airtime, a video chatting service that aims to allow friends and strangers to easily connect with each other in real time. It is a slicker, more moneyed version of Chatroulette, a website started in 2009 by then 17-year-old Russian Andrey Ternovskiy, which aimed to connect random users from across the globe to video chat with each other. That site quickly grew but then lost traction when it had difficulty policing the many lewd users who eventually overran the service. Mr Parker and Mr Fanning's goal with Airtime is similar, but includes Facebook integration, more social features, and a rigorous screening process. In a twist - after being an early investor himself in Facebook - Mr Parker has managed to raise more than $30m (£19.5m) from Facebook's other big investors, including Andreessen Horowitz and Accel Partners. Now, if only it could just work. Tech troubles It was an event that had looked to be almost depressing in its slickness. Bespectacled tech press sat in the glow of their Macs, tan celebrities strutted about in five-inch heels, and soul-crushing mini-containers of Chinese food were laid out on tables. Surrounded by the likes of chatshow host Jimmy Fallon and movie star Jim Carrey, Mr Parker stood on stage and asked grandiose questions like ""Why is the internet so boring?"" and made proclamations about changing the social web. But change, it seems, was slow in coming. ""We're going to restart this computer and then find someone to blame this on,"" said Parker, whose face froze into a semi-blank mask as his first demonstration of the chat service with actress Olivia Munn fell apart. What seemed to be an errant technical glitch quickly turned into a nightmare, as each successive celebrity - Ed Helms, Alicia Keys, even Snoop Dogg - struggled to deal with the endless parade of frozen screens and dropped connections that continued for an excruciatingly long time. ""Sean, you want to yell at your staff?"" asked comedian Ed Helms, as his attempts to connect with Airtime's offices failed. ""I swear it worked last night,"" pleaded Ms Munn, as the stars shuffled uncomfortably on stage while two helpless Airtime techs tried to get the demo version back online. ""We can't even get the microphones to work,"" Parker muttered. Those were eventually fixed. Wild, Wild, West What was notable about the Airtime launch was not so much its technical foibles, but the sheer scale of the event, a rarity in an era in which tech companies tend to launch quietly on the web before seeking fame. This is why it is tempting to see Airtime's launch as an act of hubris, of an earlier tech age whose glamour is fading, particularly in the wake of Facebook's botched initial public stock offering. Hubris, maybe, but also humanity. Mr Parker and Mr Fanning were explicit in stating that what they missed most about the internet today was the lack of serendipity. They argued that today, two teenagers like themselves would not be able to randomly find each other online because their social experiences were now so constrained. ""Facebook isn't helping you make new connections, Facebook doesn't build new relationships,"" said Mr Parker. Airtime is their attempt to rebuild, in their words, the ""Wild Wild West"" feeling of the early web, and it is something that they both clearly passionately believe in. Finding an audience When asked by the BBC why he would subject himself to the scrutiny of another launch, Mr Fanning said: ""If you're entrepreneurial, when an idea hits you, it tends to take over. This came out of that."" It remains to be seen if Airtime will become a service that people actually want to use, and if users will flock to it over similar services, like Apple's Facetime. Already, the site has the backing of one big name: Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, who reportedly showed up on the service to chat this morning. Revenue is another unanswered question, and both Mr Parker and Mr Fanning seemed vague on the mechanics of how the site would generate a profit. But first, there is the small matter of getting Airtime into the hands of users. And getting people to say what Mr Parker eventually was able to exclaim towards the end of the presentation: ""It actually works.""","What happens when you launch a product that does not work? Sean Parker and Shawn Fanning, the two former wunderkinds behind the revolutionary music sharing service Napster, just found out."
"The regulator carried out 4.2 million speed tests across the country. It found the average download speed across all networks was 1.5 megabits per second (Mbps), rising to 2.1Mbps in better coverage areas. The report said speed varied greatly depending on location, and that consumers should check coverage before signing up to tariffs. Orange fared worst in the research with its average download speeds slower than any other network. T-Mobile also came out slower than Vodafone, 3 and O2. O2's chief technology officer Derek McManus said: ""Our customers are seeing the benefit from the huge investment we have made in our network. We always aim to deliver the best network experience for our customers and these results are another indicator that we are doing just that."" Everything Everywhere - the name given to the partnership between T-Mobile and Orange - declined to comment on Ofcom's findings. The report, carried out in conjunction with monitoring specialists Epitiro, ran from September to December last year and dealt with datacards and dongles, but not smartphones. Ofcom said it hopes to run tests on smartphones soon. As well as achieving success in the download speed tests, O2 also recorded a lower average latency than 3, Orange and Vodafone. Latency is calculated by the time it takes for a data packet to travel from a user's PC to a third-party server and back again. Ofcom chief executive, Ed Richards said: ""This research gives consumers a clearer picture of the performance of mobile broadband dongle and datacards as consumers use these services to complement fixed-line services or sometimes as their principal means of accessing online services."" Usage rise Consumer research showed that 17% of UK homes are now using mobile broadband to access the internet. Of these, 7% use it as their only means of getting online - a 4% rise since 2009. The research discovered the average download speed for consumers was 1.5 Mbps, which produced an average load time of 8.5 seconds for a ""basic"" webpage. This compared to an average of 6.2 Mbit/s for fixed line broadband, Ofcom found. However, in areas with good 3G coverage, Ofcom found the average mobile speed rose to 2.1Mbps, dropping to 1.7Mbps at the peak times of between 8-9pm. On the whole, urban areas performed better than rural areas due to better 3G availability. The report noted that coverage in cities was highly variable ""with no guarantee of good performance"" in city centre locations. Hamish Macleod, chairman of the Mobile Broadband Group, told the BBC that he feels the report paints an unfair picture of mobile broadband by comparing it to fixed rate speeds. ""We recognise this is a useful exercise for Ofcom to do. ""Where I am at issue with Ofcom is the way they have made headline comparisons between fixed broadband and mobile broadband just by using averages. ""It's clear from the research that mobile broadband is a good service, that individual customers can either use it as a complement to fixed broadband or alternatively as a reliable stand alone service."" But not everyone agreed that mobile broadband is a viable alternative to fixed line services. Charlie Ponsonby, chief executive of comparison service SimplifyDigital said: ""The Ofcom report confirms what our customers tell us every day - that mobile broadband is no great substitute for home broadband. It is on average about three times slower than a standard home broadband connection and often offers very limited data usage, relative to a home broadband connection."" Mobile broadband speeds will remain well below that of fixed broadband speeds until the next generation of mobile coverage - 4G - is rolled out across the UK- a process is expected to begin in 2013. Everything Everywhere will start the first public trial of 4G in September this year. Consultation has begun into how the 4G network will be allocated to operators, with an auction due to open early next year.","Mobile broadband provided by O2 loads webpages quicker than any other UK network, research by Ofcom has found."
"TheNPD Group saidthe point-and-shoot camera market sold 17% fewer units over the first 11 months of the year compared to the same period in 2010. It said the pocket camcorder market fell by 13% over the same period. Its online survey of adults and teenagers suggested users were also more likely to opt for their phone camera to take footage ""on the fly"". Respondents said they were more likely to opt for their smartphone, rather than a dedicated device, to take pictures or video of ""fun, casual or spontaneous moments"". However, smartphones were less likely to be used when it came to holiday snaps. SLR sales stay strong NPD's data also suggested that the total share of photos taken on a camera had fallen below the halfway point for the first time. The study suggested that 44% of photos were taken on a camera over the last year, down from 52% over the previous period. By contrast the share of photos taken with a smartphone rose to 27% from 17%. However, higher-end cameras appear to be immune from the rise of the smartphone - at least for now. NPD said 12% more detachable lens cameras - including SLRs - were sold over the last 11 months. It added that sales of cameras with a 10x zoom lens or greater rose by 16%. ""There is no doubt that the smartphone is becoming 'good enough' much of the time,"" said NPD's senior imaging analyst Liz Cutting. ""But for important events, single purpose cameras or camcorders are still largely the device of choice."" 'Faff-free' Experts suggest the trend is in part due to the popularity of apps including Instagram, Twitter and Facebook which allow pictures to be uploaded to social networks immediately after they are taken. ""When you combine the fact that smartphone camera quality has increased roughly 10-fold from where we were five years ago and the fact that we have all these apps and services that make it easy to host the photos, it makes it a no-brainer that we use them rather than dedicated devices with which there is a huge faff involved to get the footage online,"" said Chris Green, principal technology analyst at Davies Murphy Group Europe. Yahoo-owned Flickr's popular photo sharing site appears to confirm the point. Its statisticssuggest that Apple's iPhone 4 is the most popular camerain its community. The next device in line is the Nikon D90 SLR camera, while the closest performing smartphone by another manufacturer is the HTC Evo 4G.","Smartphones are eating into sales of basic cameras and camcorders in the US, according to market researchers."
"Google receives 20 million ""takedown"" requests, officially known as DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright Act) notices, a month. They are all published online. Recent submissions by Fox and Universal Studios include requests for the removal of previous takedown notices. Google declined to comment. The notices are requests for individual web addresses to be removed from Google's search engine results because they contain material uploaded without the permission of the copyright holders. By making the notices available, Google is unintentionally highlighting the location of allegedly pirated material, say some experts. ""It would only take one skilled coder to index the URLs from the DMCA notices in order to create one of the largest pirate search engines available,"" wrote Torrent Freak editor Ernesto Van Der Sar on the site. Similar notices have been received by the Lionsgate studio, makers of the Twilight movies and The Hunger Games, and tech giant Microsoft, according to Torrent Freak. Mr Van Der Sar added, however, that the requests may well have been a ""by-product of the automated tools that are used to find infringing URLs"" and not deliberately included. According to its transparency report, Google complied with 97% of the requests it received for links to material published outside copyright to be removed from its search engine between June and December 2011. The website Chilling Effects, a collaboration between a number of US law schools and the Electronic Frontier Foundation, publishes the notices, and is still visible via Google Search. David Petrarca, who directed a couple of episodes of HBO drama Game of Thrones, the most pirated TV series of 2012, was reported to have said at a literary festival in Australia that piracy gave the series a ""cultural buzz"" but has since denied that he is in favour of the activity. ""I am 100 per cent, completely and utterly against people illegally downloading anything,"" he told the Sydney Morning Herald. ""I think most people would be willing to pay for a show they love.""",Two film studios have asked Google to take down links to messages sent by them requesting the removal of links connected to film piracy.
"By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter They clocked up an average of 15.1Mbps (megabits per second) while 3G averaged 6.1Mbps, it suggested. The report looked at the speed and coverage of mobile networks in five major UK cities - London, Birmingham, Manchester, Glasgow and Edinburgh. It indicated that London had the fastest 4G web browsing speeds but the slowest 3G browsing speeds. While it took just 0.72 seconds to load a standard web page on the 4G network in London, it took 1.2 seconds via 3G. Getting a web page to load on the 4G network took the longest in Glasgow (0.82 seconds) while Manchester had the best 3G browsing speeds (1.01 seconds), according to the report. Edinburgh recorded the highest download speeds for both 4G and 3G with London having the lowest for both. It is an indication that the situation regarding the performance of both 4G and 3G is complex and patchy around the country but it does make a good case for the overall performance of 4G, said Ofcom chief executive Ed Richards. ""Today's research shows 4G is providing a significantly enhanced mobile broadband experience to customers, which we expect to be available to 98% of the UK population by 2017 at the latest."" The findings help make the case for consumers who may be considering an upgrade to 4G, thinks Ovum analyst Matthew Howett. ""I expect some consumers might have held off upgrading in the belief that the network performance wouldn't be that much different, or because of a bad 3G experience, but this report clearly highlights the difference, so for operators this is probably a welcome piece of work,"" he said. Others pointed out that the report may not be an accurate portrait of 4G across the whole UK. ""Ofcom's latest report shows that 4G speeds are undoubtedly improving, but with the chosen test locations in key urban centres, it's not a real representation of the UK as a whole,"" said Ernest Doku, telecoms expert at uSwitch. ""The true picture for those based outside of major towns and cities - where it is often needed most - is still uncertain."" The report indicated that speeds varied from operator to operator. EE and Vodafone delivered the fastest average 3G download speeds at 6.8Mbps and 6.7Mbps respectively, according to the report. This compared with 3G speeds of 5.6Mbps for O2 and 5.2Mbps for Three. The 4G speed winner was EE with an average of 18.4Mbps, followed by O2 at 15.6Mbps. Vodafone's average 4G speed was 14.3Mbps and Three's 10.7Mbps, the report found. Each of the operators attempted to put their own spin on the findings. Three said it was pleased that ""in the areas that matter"" - web browsing speeds and latency - it had done well. Meanwhile Vodafone questioned the results. ""These results were undertaken over six months ago and don't give consumers a full picture as there were only a small number of tests undertaken, in a small number of cities and only taken in places where the majority of operators had coverage,"" the firm said in a statement. Coverage promises The report also looked at how the operators are performing when it comes to coverage. 4G coverage has increased rapidly and Ofcom reports that it is currently available from at least one operator in around 70% of UK premises. Mobile operators have suggested that they intend to match O2's 98% indoor coverage obligation for 4G mobile services by 2015. This is likely to extend coverage into areas underserved by 3G. One notable omission from the report is data about Three's 4G coverage. Ofcom cites differences between its data and that of Three's as the reason it was left out. The research measured the performance of 4G and 3G on smartphones, both indoors and outdoors across the five cities between March and June 2014. It looked at upload and download speeds, web browsing speeds and latency - the time it takes data to travel to a third-party server, important to reduce delays when making video calls, for example.","UK 4G speeds are more than twice as fast as 3G, according to a new report from watchdog Ofcom."
"By Leo KelionTechnology reporter Within tech circles he's long been a legend. But for most people, McAfee came to prominence last year when he fled his Central American home - teeth stained, hair dyed, in disguise - rather than let himself be questioned by authorities he accused of being corrupt. He tells the BBC he had ""no connection whatsoever"" with his neighbour's death. Police say he remains a ""person of interest"". Back in the US, after posting footage of young female ""friends"" stroking his naked tattooed torso, he now plans to neutralise the NSA's cyber-surveillance system. It might suggest a crazed, perhaps even deranged, personality. One journalist who has interviewed McAfee many times described him a ""master manipulator"" who lies and deceives. ""I've been called paranoid, schizophrenic, the wild child of Silicon Valley,"" McAfee acknowledges. But he has a different perspective: ""I'm an entrepreneur. I always have been. I am curious and I enjoy solving problems. ""I think that it's when we step out of the road, step outside the box, become our own person and we walk fearlessly down paths other people wouldn't look at, that true progress comes. And sometimes true beauty as well. ""We're missing that. We're missing the people who have the courage to walk into the wilderness just to see what's there."" This is how Amy Emshwiller, the teenage ex-prostitute he lived with in Belize, describes him: ""He's sweet, generous. He likes to like adventures. He's serious and usually he has a dark sense of humour. He's generally a sweet guy. He just doesn't like to be [expletive] with."" So, who is the real John McAfee? To have any chance of knowing and gaining an informed opinion of what really motivated his erratic-sounding behaviour after the killing of Gregory Faull, you must travel deep into the 68-year-old's past. Addicted and expelled Despite his Southern accent, the bleached-blond and goateed businessman is in fact half-British - the son of an Englishwoman who met an American soldier stationed in the UK during World War II. ""I feel as much British as I do American,"" McAfee says. ""There's not much difference between our countries."" They moved to Virginia when he was young, where he had a troubled childhood. His father was an abusive alcoholic who, when McAfee was aged 15, shot himself dead. In the following years, McAfee says, he too began drinking heavily and taking drugs, but still managed to maintain a promising academic career. That came to an end in the late 1960s when Northeast State Louisiana State College terminated his PhD in mathematics after it was revealed that he had slept with an undergraduate he was mentoring. They later married and McAfee turned his skills to a series of programming jobs with some of the biggest tech organisations of the time including Nasa, General Electric, Siemens, Univac and Xerox, all the while continuing to indulge in his addictions. ""Most of my bosses also used drugs of some kind,"" he says. ""I was in the tech field, after all, we were the leading edge in technology and the leading age in personal experimentation. ""I had to hide it from my mother and sometimes from my wife. But in the work environment - depending on where you worked - in some companies drugs were taken openly at lunchtime in people's offices. It was a bizarre time."" Matters came to a head in the early 1980s after his wife left him, his most recent employer, Omex, let him go and the scale of his drug dependency forced him to seek help. ""It was 1984, the last time that I took drugs, drank alcohol or sold drugs for that matter,"" he says. ""I simply stopped. I started going to an organisation called Alcoholics Anonymous... and that was my last taste of that world. ""However, it is still with me. My body is covered with tattoos from that period. And I'm afraid some of my ideas and concepts and attitudes that were moulded during that time are still with me. That's why people think, perhaps, I'm a little bit off the wall."" Anti-virus millionaire Despite his troubles, McAfee managed to land a job at defence contractor Lockheed Martin, where he worked on a classified voice-recognition program. There he came across an unusual bit of self-replicating code designed to copy itself on to any floppy disk inserted into affected computers. When examined, it contained the message: ""Welcome to the dungeon. Beware of this VIRUS."" ""When I first read about the Pakistani Brain virus, I'd never heard of a virus before, neither had anyone in technology,"" remembers McAfee. ""It fascinated me."" He worked out a way to disinfect the computers and then spread the cure via the bulletin board system, a precursor to the web. The challenge inspired him to set up a business of his own: McAfee Associates - a firm that would later be sold, years after he had left, to Intel for more than $7.6bn (£4.7bn). ""I knew the field would become extremely large because people being who they are, there will always be hackers,"" he says. ""It's why we have graffiti on the walls of the inner city. People like to deface things. They like to disrupt things. ""So, given that fact, computer viruses were not going to go away and were only going to get worse. I just did what I could to be at the forefront of that industry for as long as I could."" Despite this, he says, he has never himself used any of the products made by the firm that continues to bear his name. ""I'm constantly under attack, yet I use no software protection. ""I protect myself by constantly changing my IP [internet protocol] address, by not attaching my name to any device I use, and by not going on to sites where you might pick up a virus. ""Porn sites, for example, I just don't go there. ""Secondly, I practise safe computing. If someone sends me an email with a link, I'm not going there until I can call the person to verify that they sent me the email. ""It sounds absurd to live that way, but I would rather trust my own devices and thoughts than someone else's software."" After selling his stake in the business in 1994, McAfee went on to found and sell other companies, including an instant messaging system, a firewall provider and a ranch from which he offered flights in ""trikes"" - low-flying, engine-powered cabins suspended from hang-gliders. Then he headed south. Research and raid In 2008, at an age others might be thinking of putting up their feet, McAfee moved to the jungle of Belize with the stated intention of trying to cure another kind of infection. ""I came across a concept called quorum sensing, which is the technique that bacteria use to communicate with each other. ""Up until about 10 years ago we didn't even know that bacteria did communicate, but we find out they have a very sophisticated communication system. I wanted to explore and investigate that to see if we could come up with new antibiotics."" He picked the area, he says, because the plants that grew along the country's Rio Nuevo river contained compounds that inhibit bacteria from sending chemical signals to each other and thus thwart their ability to co-ordinate an attack. Things didn't go as planned. The first sign of trouble was when journalists invited to his Carmelita, Orange Walk, base wrote stories that made clear they did not know what to make of the operation. Then a falling-out with the microbiologist he was working with, Allison Adonizio, put the project at risk when she quit. Dr Adonizio, who is now based in Philadelphia, did not want to be interviewed. In April 2012, matters came to a head when the Belize police force's Gang Suppression Unit raided the research facility. McAfee says the officers claimed they suspected it was being used to make the illegal psycho-stimulant methamphetamine. They shot his dog, he says, confiscated both his passport and licensed weapons on the property, and briefly imprisoned him before dropping the charges. ""Under no circumstances did they really believe it was a meth lab,"" he states. ""Everybody knew it was a biotech lab because I had hired half of the people in the village to work there. They all knew what I was doing. ""It's a pirate haven. It's an extremely corrupt and dangerous place. ""I knew this and my friends all advised me against it. I just thought I was smart enough to sidestep it. Unfortunately, I was not. ""I was there for a year and the local politician sent a representative and asked for $2m for a campaign donation. I said no. Two weeks later they raided my compound."" McAfee says when he was asked a second time for the cash he went on a publicity blitz, posting messages online, and speaking to local and international press about the incident. It became political. The Belize Times - published by the leading opposition party - suggested the ""barbaric assault"" on McAfee was a ""global black eye"" for the nation and a threat to its tourist industry. ""I do wish that I were smarter socially,"" reflects McAfee. ""I think I have the ability to solve mathematical equations and programming issues very easily, but I am a little bit naive in some social situations. And certainly in Belize I was way naive."" At the time of the raid, McAfee had begun an affair with a 16-year-old ex-prostitute he had met on Belize Independence Day. ""I was partying, I was drinking, and I went into this bar and the owner said a friend wants to meet me and likes me,"" remembers Amy Emshwiller, who still lives in Belize. ""[He said] can I have your number, and then two weeks later he called me."" She says he was unaware she was less than a quarter of his age. ""He didn't know how old I was. I lied to him saying I was 18, and he thought it was OK. ""I let him fall in love first before I told him my age. ""When I told him he was so [expletive] shocked that he didn't know what to do. He was baffled. And he was like: 'I still love you, I don't know what to do. I'm in love with a young girl.' That's how that happened."" McAfee's long-term American girlfriend left him. And like many things in his life, the new affair proved complicated. One night Emshwiller took McAfee's gun. She aimed it at his head, squeezed her eyes shut and pulled the trigger. She missed. He continued the relationship. ""Amy, for one - and many girls in Belize - has a horrific story of abuse that if I told you, you could not believe it,"" McAfee explains. ""Of course she's not going to be well. Of course she's going to have issues. ""When she tried to shoot me in the head what I saw was a frightened child. ""What I saw was a confused girl who had been so abused - physically, sexually, emotionally - beyond any description. ""What are you going to do? Throw her out? That doesn't help her. ""All she did was burst my eardrum. I'm deaf in one ear now, but I don't have a bullet in my head. Forgiveness is one of the graces that we have as human beings. Can I be faulted for indulging in it?"" Emshwiller confirms the event but says she wanted to scare, not kill, him after he had said he wanted another girl. She adds it was not the only such incident provoked by her jealousy. ""One time before, I held him in the corner and I put a knife at his throat,"" she says. ""And he just said: 'Go ahead. Kill me.' And I couldn't do it. I just dropped the knife and walked out."" Following the raid, McAfee and Emshwiller moved to his villa at San Pedro - a town on Belize's biggest island, Ambergris Caye - where they agreed to have an open relationship. There they were visited by Chad Essley, a cartoonist, who began collaborating on a book about McAfee's life. ""I didn't quite realise that his lifestyle would be this older guy surrounded by young girls and bodyguards with guns,"" he says. ""Many of these girls were former prostitutes or had very rough lives. ""It was expressly forbidden to go out in the town and drink - the smell of alcohol, he could not be around it. He didn't want any of the girls doing any drugs at all. ""I interviewed each of these girls, got their background. They were incredibly sad. They were definitely in a better sort of situation being around John."" Meanwhile next door, Gregory Faull, an Orlando sports bar owner who had recently divorced and decided to live in his Belize holiday home, was becoming increasingly irate at his neighbour's activities. 'Hatchet buried' On Thursday, 8 November 2012, McAfee made the local headlines when he donated 40 stun guns, handcuffs and batons to the local police at a press conference. Mayor Daniel Guerrero thanked him, stating: ""Crime is affecting the tourism industry as we have been listed on travel advisories; it is time to stop this. Let us protect our industry and turn San Pedro into the safe haven once more."" That night the local TV bulletin declared that ""the hatchet was formally buried"", suggesting the rift between McAfee and Belize's authorities had ended. Early on Sunday morning, Mr Faull was found dead in a pool of his blood by his housekeeper. Police called to the scene found a single 9mm shell nearby. They said a mobile phone and laptop were missing but there were no visible signs of a forced entry. The head of the police's Gang Suppression Unit told a local newspaper that his officers wanted to speak to McAfee as part of the investigation, but when they called at his house he did not appear to be in. An article posted the following day by Wired magazine revealed why. McAfee told the publication he had seen the officers approaching and had hidden in the sand of his property putting a cardboard box over his head. He recalls that his caretaker had told him of Mr Faull's murder, and now he feared for his own life. ""The first thing that came to my mind was, 'Oh, my Lord. The government is finally trying to rid themselves of me,' he says. ""The government does from time to time. ""I had certainly been a huge thorn in their side, and they had simply got the wrong white man. ""Seriously, this is what went through my mind. My friends sort of calmed me down, and later said that's absurd. At the time I did not think so."" McAfee acknowledges that he and Mr Faull had been at odds, but plays down the idea they hated each other or that he suspected him of being the person who had fed two of Emshwiller's dogs a poisoned tortilla. ""The entire five years I was there, I'd said maybe 15 words to him,"" he says. ""He did not like my dogs and the past two occasions I had seen him walking on the beach he complained. But so did everybody. ""There was no ongoing argument. Yeah, he was mad about my dogs. Maybe as I'm beginning to think now, maybe he was the one who poisoned them. At the time I certainly did not believe that."" In fact, as ABC News later revealed, Mr Faull had filed a complaint to Mayor Guerrero about McAfee the previous month. It said McAfee's dog had attacked a tourist; that his security guards had ""terrified"" other residents by walking around with shotguns and shining lights in their eyes, and that taxis and other traffic had been arriving at his property ""at all hours"", causing a disturbance. ""I did not find that out until weeks after I came back to the States,"" says McAfee when pressed about this. ""Belize is not like America where you file a complaint and then the police come out and chase things out. You file a complaint and it goes into a drawer."" Hiding out McAfee then went on the run, saying he feared he would be ""silenced"" if he was caught and thrown in jail. It made headlines worldwide, in no small part due to the fact that he was posting updates to a blog and giving frequent interviews - actions he says were designed to ensure he couldn't be made to disappear if he had been caught. ""I disguised myself as a ragged salesman,"" he recalls. ""All it takes is some dirty clothes and not bathing for a few days and not combing my hair. ""You know, people saw my photograph everywhere because all of the police and army had it for that month and a half I was underground. I just made sure I looked different than that."" Questioned about the affair, Dean Barrow, Belize's prime minister, made it clear McAfee was not an official murder suspect, and had only been classed instead a ""person of interest"". ""I don't want to be unkind to the gentleman, but I believe he is extremely paranoid, even bonkers,"" the politician added. During this time McAfee continued to see Emshwiller. ""When he was on the run I went for lunches with him and then he would call and say: 'Come to this place, or go there,' she recalls. ""How to come, when to come. Not to go out, or stay home, or go to a different location. He would tell me that so nobody would get me."" She adds that she regrets she did not go with him when he finally decided to escape the country. The next major development came on 3 December when a reporter and photographer from Vice magazine revealed they were documenting McAfee's life on the run. In what proved a frustrating twist for the tech guru, they then unwittingly revealed he had crossed the border to Guatemala - a fact revealed by a photo uploaded to the Vice website by staff at its headquarters, who failed to wipe its location data. ""I had gone out of my way to arrange the escape and I was breathing easily and looking forward to a few days of relaxation,"" remembers McAfee. ""We immediately had to go on the run again because we were in Guatemala illegally at this point. But it was no-one's real fault. It was just the fault of the moment."" A few days later McAfee was arrested. There was initially speculation he would be sent back to Belize, but a week later he was allowed to fly to Miami a free man. ""After it was over I asked myself, 'Good Lord, I must have been afraid,'"" he says. ""But I really can't remember. I remember merely trying to solve the problems that occurred as they occurred."" Hero and villain McAfee has offered a $25,000 bounty for information relating to Mr Faull's death, but says an attempt to contact the victim's family proved unsuccessful. The family has called the reward a ""hollow gesture"" and suggested if McAfee really wanted to help he would have met with the Belize police. A spokesman for the country's government said its authorities still wanted to speak to the businessman. ""Mr McAfee's claims and his behaviour have been extreme,"" he told the BBC. ""The investigation is ongoing and McAfee remains a person of interest. If McAfee were to respond to questioning it would make a difference to the progress of the investigation - but this is currently out of the hands of the government of Belize."" So long as the crime remains unsolved, it is inevitable the entrepreneur will always face suspicion. But he says he can live with that. ""There's always going to be someone who likes you and someone who dislikes you,"" he says. ""Someone who thinks you're a hero and some that think you're a villain. You know I just do what I can in situations like this to continue to state that I'm totally innocent."" That doesn't mean he is trying to forget his time in Belize. In addition to the graphic novel, he is working with a Canadian firm to make both a documentary and a movie about his time there. He adds that George Jung - the imprisoned cocaine drugs lord portrayed by Johnny Depp in the film Blow - has been picked to write his biography. While those projects brew, McAfee has returned to Silicon Valley, announcing the forthcoming launch of a $100 gadget that he promises can make you invisible on the net. ""If you cannot see it, you cannot hack it, you cannot look at it, you cannot spy on anything happening inside it,"" he explains. He says the D-Central units will fit in people's pockets and allow their phones, tablets and PCs to communicate with other owners' devices within a three-block radius. He adds they can also connect to the net anonymously via a node - a separate piece of equipment attached to the network - either directly or with their encrypted data relayed relayed via other D-Central boxes. Each will frequently change their network identifier - a long number used by devices as an ID - making them hard to track, he explains. He suggests it will appeal to college students who want to copy music anonymously and to businesses wanting to prevent the theft of corporate secrets. He's also well aware that in the light of Edward Snowden's leaks about surveillance techniques used by the US and UK governments, part of the appeal will be thwarting their efforts. ""You know from their own paranoia and desire to stay in power, they are watching everything they can,"" he says. Will the tech work? Will he really frustrate the authorities once again? At this point, like so much of John McAfee's life, it's impossible to be sure of all the facts and it's ultimately up to you whether you take him at his word.","Who is the real John McAfee? He's the man who went on the run after his neighbour was found dead, face-up, with a bullet in his head. He's the man who jump-started the multibillion-dollar anti-virus industry. And now he thinks he can make you invisible on the internet."
"By Andrew WebbBBC World Service BBC producer Andrew Webb wasn't able to visit his mother in hospital in the last days before her death. Instead, he used technology to spend time with her virtually. Similar stories are playing out around the world, as coronavirus restrictions prevent families from visiting desperately ill patients in their final days and hours. Here, Andrew shares what happened to his mother, Kathleen Webb, and how he managed to stay connected with her until the end, despite being physically distant. There is also a full guide on how to use similar technology at the end of the article. My mum had a heart attack on the day that we were meant to be celebrating our parents' 50th wedding anniversary. But we'd already cancelled the family meal we were supposed to have. My brother Laurence and I had discussed the threat of coronavirus, and nearly two weeks before the UK government introduced social restrictions we decided to protect our mum and dad by stopping the celebration. Had it happened, we'd have all met up near their home in the south-west of England in the middle of March - the weekend before the UK celebrated Mother's Day. Back in November 2019, my mum had life-saving emergency surgery after her bowel ruptured. The problem re-emerged days before their anniversary celebrations had been due to take place. My dad took her into hospital. Over the following weeks, she was unable to keep food down, grew weaker, and eventually died after her upper bowel ruptured. Doctors believed surgery would have killed her, and if it hadn't, would have left her with a very poor quality of life. There was little they could do. Although UK restrictions weren't yet in place, coronavirus was already taking hold and our family faced a very difficult dilemma: How could we visit a frail and ailing relative in hospital when we could pose a risk to them, and to other patients and staff? And then there was the risk to us. My brother's family have underlying health conditions, so he decided he couldn't compromise their safety by visiting a hospital. My dad, Bernie - aged 75 - visited my mum's hospital wearing decorating masks and gloves that I had posted to him. I began to prepare him for the reality that not only was it a potential risk to everyone when he went there, but that laws were likely to be passed preventing hospital visits. We had been using WhatsApp on smartphones to talk to my mum, with my dad answering from her bedside, then holding the mobile phone up for her to see us. This let several of us have video conference calls between the hospital ward and family in both London and Hong Kong. But once the coronavirus lockdown began, my dad had to stop visiting in person. My mum's poor health meant she wasn't capable of answering a phone unaided, so we had to call the hospital and ask the nurses to answer the phone that my dad had left with her. Then suddenly, my mum was moved into isolation with suspected coronavirus. The brave nurses were putting on gloves, masks and gowns to enter her room. I arranged video calls to coincide with the nurses going in - they were always happy to help, knowing that because of the lockdown, the phone was my mum's only lifeline to the outside world. But then the phone stopped working. It was broken - and since we had to get a different phone to my mum anyway, we decided to experiment with a number of apps. My brother and dad discovered that Skype has an auto-answer function. We also installed an app called AirDroid that enabled us to view the new phone's screen remotely and operate it. My brother sterilised the phone at his veterinary surgery and drove to the hospital. He gave the phone to a nurse, by laying it in front of the hospital and waiting for her to arrive and pick it up as he stood more than 2m away. My mum lived a few more days, getting weaker and weaker. The nurses propped the phone up, so we could call in over Skype and see her when it answered automatically. I ordered a phone tripod online, but it only arrived in time for her funeral. Saying goodbye Over Skype video, my mum said goodbye to me, my brother and her grandchildren, including my six-year-old daughter who lives in the US state of Virginia. Without modern phone apps, this would have been impossible. So, in a twist of fate, coronavirus had forced us to find a way of communicating that enabled her closest family to join in remotely, and brought more of us together at the crucial moment. My dad said his own goodbye to his wife of 50 years on a phone call, although he was only 30km (19 miles) away. The nursing staff were fantastic, checking on my mum repeatedly. But on two occasions I called and heard my mum calling for pain relief, alone in her coronavirus isolation room. I phoned the nursing station, and my mum was given painkillers a few moments earlier than might have happened without the phone by her bedside. A few hours before she died, I connected to the phone at 02:00 and heard her calling out the names of her nearest and dearest. I soothed her for 15 minutes, and talked to her until she fell asleep. I don't think she ever woke up. Video funeral My dad and my brother's family attended a 10-minute cremation service a couple of weeks later. Under UK laws, up to 10 people can go to a funeral, but we decided it was safer if only a few people went. And so apart from two neighbours, no other mourners - including myself - were in attendance. We were still concerned about the risk of infection, so my brother's family wore masks. There was no video facility at the crematorium, so my brother and nephew used Zoom on their own phones to share the service with my friends and me. I recorded it for people who weren't able to join us in watching on the day. The Church diocese wouldn't allow my mum's vicar to carry out the service because he is over 70, and thought to be more vulnerable to Covid-19. A younger vicar, whom we hadn't met before, took the service. Tribute video We now have a record of the service that, if it weren't for coronavirus, we would never have had. As soon as the funeral was over I edited the video and used photographs to create a memorial to my mum. I deliberately recorded different shots throughout the funeral so that I captured everyone who attended online, as well as both feeds from the crematorium. This was the first time I truly grieved the loss of my mum. I'd been worried that for three weeks, I hadn't really been upset, and feared I might break down later. However, editing family photos and listening to the music I used, composed and performed by my niece, Jude Pegler Webb, for her college course, was a very tearful experience. It was technology that helped me begin the grieving process. My overwhelming memory of this period is the generosity, strength and kindness of others. I just hope a little of what I've learned about how to use technology in such difficult circumstances can help people in a similar situation. Kathleen Webb died on 31 March 2020, aged 75 - she did not contract coronavirus and the disease had no impact on the quality of her medical treatment. How we did it: Virtual hospital visits 1. We downloaded Skype, because it allows multiple people to make video calls together across the main operating systems. We used Android phones, Apple iPhones, Macbook Pro computers, and Windows 10 computers. It is only possible to use Apple's FaceTime video-call app if you are all using Apple products, which we were not. However, Google's equivalent - Hangouts - works on Apple and Android devices. 2. On the Google Android phone that was going to be delivered to my mum, we went into settings on the Skype app and activated the option to automatically answer the device when called: a. Select ""Chats"", at the bottom left of the screen, then select your profile picture at the top centre (this will be an icon of a head and shoulders if you've not uploaded a profile picture). b. Select ""Settings"", at the bottom of the screen. c. Select ""Calling"", which opens up the ""Calling Settings"" menu: d. Select ""Answer incoming calls automatically"". Also select ""Start my video automatically"" to enable the phone in hospital to show you at home what its front camera is pointed at. e. Another option appears near the bottom of the screen: ""Only allow Skype calls from contacts to ring on this device"". If you select this, you could easily find that someone wants to join the call, but they are blocked. Therefore, we left this option off. Although this meant strangers could have connected, they'd have to have known or guessed my mum's Skype ID. I'd set it up just a few days prior and only gave it to my family - so an unwanted call was extremely unlikely. If the patient previously used the Skype account often, such as for work, it would be much safer to create and log into a new account on the phone they will have. This would ensure that only the family and close friends can call the Skype account. Other apps, such as Zoom and Microsoft Teams, have auto-answer functions, as do Apple devices by changing Accessibility settings. Automatic backups We turned off automatic updates on the phone - the last thing we wanted was for the phone to reboot and require account passwords to be re-entered. Instructions to turn off auto-updates on Android devices Instructions to turn off auto-updates on Apple mobile devices Backup chat apps We installed several other video call apps in case Skype failed. Video call apps include WhatsApp, Google Hangouts, Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Facebook's Messenger and Line for Android, Apple and Microsoft Windows devices. However, the automatic answer facility available with video conferencing offered by Skype was the reason we chose it - plus it was simple for my dad to use in isolation at home. Some other very detailed and professional systems require you to log into a website to adjust this function. Facebook has just announced it will support up to 50 people chatting in its new Messenger Rooms. This could prove to be a rival to Zoom for recreational purposes, at a time that socialising is happening over chat apps, rather than in person. Modern Apple devices running iOS 12.1.4 or iPadOS also support conference calls with FaceTime. You have to tap the screen then flick up the menu from below the initial menu, so it's not as obvious how to do this as it is in Skype. And, remember that FaceTime is only available for Apple devices. Controlling the phone: AirDroid We installed the AirDroid app on an Android phone and computers, to view what the phone's screen was showing and operate it remotely. AirDroid has versions for Android, Windows, Apple iOS, and Apple Mac OS X. However, it can only control Android devices and is a file-sharing system for Apple devices. ApowerMirror is an alternative app to control an Android device from a Windows PC or a Mac, and there are others with some similar features. We chose AirDroid to give us an option to answer calls or change settings. It's clearly a security risk if installed without someone's knowledge. But it appeared ideal for controlling a phone in these circumstances, as a backup, should Skype require a password to be re-entered, for instance. There have also been reports of security loopholes. AirDroid has said that it is secure. One problem emerged when the phone powered down after being unplugged from a charger, and we couldn't reconnect to AirDroid - although it should have been possible and worked in our tests. If it had worked in hospital, we could have known whether the phone was plugged into a charger after it had been switched back on. For Apple devices, the pre-installed Find My iPhone app gives you battery information. Tripod and charging cable I ordered tripods with extendable legs that could stand on the floor and reach head height, or be collapsed to stand on a bedside table. I also mail-ordered several 3m charging cables, addressed to the ward. Short cables proved difficult in these circumstances and were the main reason the phone powered down, after which AirDroid failed. Both orders arrived after my mum's death, so I asked the hospital to keep the cables, and the tripods were used at the funeral.

"Called Transformer Book, the computer features Windows 8 OS - the newest version of the Windows operating system. It converts into a tablet once the screen is detached. A number of other firms are expected to unveil devices running Windows 8 OS once the event starts on Tuesday. The detached screen of the Transformer Book becomes ""the world's biggest tablet"", said Asus chairman Jonney Shih at a pre-Computex press conference. The display comes in 11.6, 13 or 14-inch options, indeed making the tablet one of the largest on the market. Another hybrid device unveiled by the Taiwanese firm is called the Taichi. It looks like a regular laptop - but it has two displays. When closed, the device is transformed into a tablet. But when open, it becomes a laptop with a full-HD screen on each side - allowing two people sitting face-to-face to simultaneously view a screen. ""Not that there's anything wrong sitting next to each other, but this looks much better,"" said Mr Shih. Windows 8 OS Both Asus devices run Microsoft's new Windows 8 OS, expected to be released later this year. The Transformer Book, though, also runs Android operating system - which comes into play once the device is converted into a tablet. It is expected that Windows 8 OS will be present on a number of devices technology companies are getting ready to unveil at the show. Besides Asus, other Taiwanese computer manufacturers, such as Acer and Micro Star International, have said that they will demonstrate products running Windows 8. The trade show's organiser, The Taipei Computer Association, said that the convertible notebook-tablet computers will be the ""reinforced battle power of Windows 8"". The new operating system is touch-enabled and has been designed for tablets, notebooks and other hand-held devices. According to Microsoft, Windows 8 will allow users to freely switch between the touch control interface, a keyboard or mouse. Microsoft said that tens of thousands of improvements had been made to what it calls the most important redesign of its interface since Windows 95. Consumers can now download the release preview of Windows 8 , a system which Microsoft says is its most tested operating system ever. It is expected to go on sale in the autumn, three years after Windows 7.","Hours before Computex 2012 trade show kicks off in Taipei, Taiwan, Asus has showcased its Windows 8-based laptop-tablet hybrid device."
"By James ClaytonNorth America technology reporter Nicolas Kurona, aged 30, said he managed to buy Google.com.ar through a normal, legal process. ""I never imagined that it was going to allow me to buy it,"" he told the BBC. Google Argentina told the BBC: ""For a short term, the domain was acquired by someone else."" It added it had regained control of the domain very quickly. The story started when Nicolas was at his desk on the outskirts of Buenos Aires on Wednesday night, designing a website for a client. He started getting messages on WhatsApp that Google was down. ""I entered www.google.com.ar into my browser and it didn't work,"" he said. ""I thought something strange was happening."" He decided to go on to the Network Information Center Argentina (NIC) - the organisation responsible for operating the .ar country code domains. He searched for Google - and up popped Argentina's Google domain available for purchase. Despite thinking it would not work, he ""followed the steps and then I received an email with the purchase invoice"", he said. Nicolas shared the NIC invoice with the BBC. Google Argentina's domain name was acquired for 270 pesos (£2.08/$2.90). 'I was frozen' Dumbfounded, he tapped www.google.com.ar into his search bar and pressed enter. ""My personal data appeared,"" he said. ""I was frozen looking at the screen. I could not believe what had just happened."" At 21.52 local time on Wednesday, Nicolas bought Google Argentina's domain name. All of those millions of Google searches, and people coming to www.google.com.ar, were now in theory, coming to him. ""I want to make it clear that I never had any bad intentions, I just tried to buy it and the NIC allowed me to,"" he said. Nicolas's night had, in just a few minutes, turned into a major news story. ""When the purchase process was completed and my data appeared, I knew that something was going to happen... I was really anxious,"" he said. Nicolas tweeted what had happened - to try to clarify how events had gone down, he said. So what on earth happened? Well, one theory is that Google had simply forgotten to renew its domain name. However, Google says its licence for the domain hadn't expired - and was not due to expire until July 2021. Open Data Córdoba group (which is dedicated to tracking expired Argentine domains, and tracking registered ones) backs this up. It's still unclear why Google's domain name was released. Nicolas says he has no idea what happened, but it feels ""slightly strange"" to have so much media attention. He has been hailed as a hero in some corners of Twitter, and his tweet clarifying what happened has racked up 80,000 likes. Nicolas says he's just relieved that he didn't get into trouble. He says the NIC took the domain name away from him shortly after he purchased it, but his 270 pesos have not been returned. He says Google didn't get in touch, and that he wasn't paid. Google has yet to clear up how they got the domain name back. The company is investigating what went down on Wednesday. But for some reason, for a few minutes at least, Google lost control of Google Argentina this week - to a 30-year-old web designer, it seems.

"The Chinese entrepreneur said he was ""quite optimistic"" about AI and thought it was nothing for ""street smart"" people like them to be scared of. ""I don't know man, that's like famous last words,"" responded Tesla's chief. Mr Musk added that technology was evolving faster than our ability to understand it. The two did, however, agree on one topic: that one of the biggest problems the world is facing is population collapse. The businessmen are two of the most influential tech leaders shaping the world today. US-based Mr Musk made his fortune at the digital payments firm PayPal before going on to run electric car-maker Tesla, space rocket company SpaceX and tunnel-transport business The Boring Company among other ventures. He also helped create OpenAI, a San Francisco-based AI research company, although he has since broken ties with it. Mr Ma co-founded Alibaba, which rivals Amazon for the title of the world's largest e-retailer and is also one of the world's largest cloud computing providers. The group is one of the world's biggest spenders on AI, both within its own business as well as via investments in dozens of third-party companies. Their 45-minute conversation kicked off the World AI Conference (WAIC), which ties into China's goal of overtaking the US to become the world's leading artificial intelligence innovator by 2030. Less work Mr Ma focused much of his comments on how machine learning could act as a force for good. He said it was something ""to embrace"" and would deliver fresh insights into how people think. ""When human beings understand ourselves better, then we can improve the world better,"" he explained. Furthermore, he predicted AI would help create new kinds of jobs, which would require less of our time and be centred on creative tasks. ""I think people should work three days a week, four hours a day,"" he said. ""In the artificial intelligence period, people can live 120 years. ""At that time we are going to have a lot of jobs which nobody [will] want to do. So, we need artificial intelligence for the robots to take care of the old guys. ""So that's my view about jobs, don't worry about it, we will have jobs."" By contrast, Mr Musk suggested that mass unemployment was a real concern. ""AI will make jobs kind of pointless,"" he claimed. ""Probably the last job that will remain will be writing AI, and then eventually, the AI will just write its own software."" He added that there was a risk that human civilization could come to an end and ultimately be seen as a staging post for a superior type of life. ""You could sort of think of humanity as a biological boot loader for digital super-intelligence,"" Mr Musk explained. ""A boot loader is... sort of like the minimal bit of code necessary for a computer to start. ""You couldn't evolve silicon circuits. There needed to be biology to get there."" To avoid such a fate, he said we needed to find a way to connect our brains to computers so that we could ""go along for the ride with AI"" - something he is trying to achieve via one of his latest start-ups. Otherwise, he cautioned, AI would become weary of trying to communicate with humans, as we would be much slower thinkers in comparison. ""Human speech to a computer will sound like very slow tonal wheezing, kind of like whale sounds,"" Mr Musk explained. ""What's our bandwidth? Like a few hundred bits per second, basically, maybe a few kilobits per second, if you're going to be generous. ""Whereas a computer can easily communicate at a terabit level. So, the computer will just get impatient if nothing else. It'll be like talking to a tree - that's humans. ""It will be barely getting any information out."" By contrast, Mr Ma acknowledged that AI could now beat humans at games like chess and Go, but claimed computers would only be one of several intelligent tools that we would develop in time. ""Don't worry about the machines,"" he said. ""For sure, we should understand one thing: that man can never make another man. ""A computer is a computer. A computer is just a toy. ""Man cannot even make a mosquito. So, we should have a confidence. Computers only have chips, men have the heart. It's the heart where the wisdom comes from."" Although Mr Ma acknowledged that we needed to find ways to become ""more creative and constructive"", he concluded that ""my view is that [a] computer may be clever, but human beings are much smarter"". Mr Musk responded: ""Yeah, definitely not. ""It's going to get to the point where [AI] just can completely simulate a person in every way possible, like many people simultaneously,"" he added. ""In fact, there's a strong argument, we're in the simulation right now."" Towards the end of the event the two men came together on one point - that concerns about overpopulation were misguided. ""Assuming... there's a benevolent future with AI, I think that the biggest problem the world will face in 20 years is population collapse,"" said Mr Musk ""I want to emphasise this, the biggest issue in 20 years will be population collapse, not explosion collapse."" Mr Ma said he was absolutely in agreement. ""One point four billion in China sounds a lot, but I think [over the] next 20 years we'll see this thing bring big trouble to China,"" he said. ""And the speed of population decreasing is going to speed up. Now you've got a collapse."" However, he suggested, using AI to help people live longer, healthier lives could be part of the solution.",Alibaba's Jack Ma and Tesla's Elon Musk took opposing views of the risks and potential rewards of artificial intelligence at an event in Shanghai.
"In recent weeks, attacks have been mounted on Linksys and Asus routers via loopholes that thieves could exploit. In Poland, reports suggest one gang has successfully adjusted router settings in a bid to steal cash. A separate study found many of the routers sold online have bugs that attackers could easily exploit. This week the Internet Storm Center (ISC) warned about a continuing attempt to exploit a vulnerability in 23 separate models of Linksys routers. The virus, a self-replicating program or worm called The Moon, takes control of the router and then uses it to scan for other vulnerable systems. So far, wrote ISC researcher Johannes Ullrich, it is not clear why the routers are being compromised and what might be done with them. There are hints in the exploit code that the routers will at some point be gathered together into a network of compromised machines, he said in a blogpost. Currently, he added, all the worm was doing was spreading to other Linksys routers. Benevolent hacking In a statement, Linksys said it was aware of the Moon malware and said it took hold on hardware only if a Remote Management Access feature was turned on. Turning the router off and disabling the remote management system should clear out the worm, it added. Linksys has also published technical advice about how to update the core software for vulnerable routers and how to turn off the remote management feature. Earlier this month, many users of Asus routers who remotely connect via the gadget to hard drives in their homes, perhaps to watch DVDs they have ripped, found that someone had used the same feature to upload a text file urging them to do more to make the device safe. The letter is thought to have been left on the hard drives by benevolent hackers who exploited a loophole on the Asus routers first discovered in mid-2013. Ten separate models of Asus router are believed to be vulnerable to the same exploit. Asus released a software update last week to close the loophole. The two incidents come soon after Poland's Computer Emergency Response Team reported a large-scale attack on home routers by thieves seeking log-in names and passwords for online bank accounts. That attack infected vulnerable routers with software that snooped on traffic before passing it on to the bank sites people were trying to reach. A separate study by security firm Tripwire has found that 80% of the 25 best-selling routers available on Amazon are vulnerable to compromise. Security researcher Craig Young from Tripwire said exploits had been publicly discussed and published for more than one-third of these devices. The past 12 months have seen a flurry of interest in routers by security researchers keen to find bugs and loopholes. One project detailing their findings now lists hundreds of exploits for routers from 36 separate manufacturers. ""In recent years, the computing power of the average home router has increased substantially to support features like streaming media and file or print sharing,"" said Mr Young. ""These additional features offer new attack surface while the additional computing power creates new possibilities for what an attacker can do with a compromised device.""",Serious security failings in home routers are getting more attention from both attackers and researchers.
"By Zoe KleinmanTechnology reporter, BBC News Sunday, 7 October is the 60th anniversary of the barcode patent, filed in the US in 1952. However the distinctive black-and-white stripes did not make their first appearance in an American shop until 1974 - because the laser technology used to read them did not exist. GS1 said the QR code was not a threat to the traditional linear barcode. A QR (Quick Response) code is an image made up of dots, which can contain more data than a barcode. ""They have different purposes - the barcode on the side of a tin of beans is for point-of-sale scanning. It ensures the consumer is charged the right amount and updates stock records,"" said Gary Lynch, chief executive of GS1 UK. ""The QR code's main purpose is to take the person that scans it to an extended multi media environment. Technically you can combine the two but nobody's asking for that right now."" The first item to be scanned by a barcode was a packet of chewing gum in an Ohio supermarket in 1974. But the black-and-white stripes did not get a universal welcome, with some wine manufacturers refusing to incorporate barcodes onto their labels for aesthetic reasons. Now it occasionally doubles as body art, with US singer Pink among those who sport a barcode tattoo. ""Barcodes are an icon and rightly so - we're quite pleased about it,"" said Mr Lynch. ""But if one of my daughters had one in homage to her father I'd be rather upset.""","There are now more than five million individual barcodes in use around the world, according to regulator GS1 UK."

"At 15:30 GMT on 16 March, a network of spam-producing computers, known as Rustock, suddenly stopped. Raids on the network's infrastructure were triggered by a long-running investigation by Microsoft. During raids, servers that acted as Rustock's command and control systems were seized. In 2010, the Rustock botnet - a collection of infected machines - was the most prolific producer of spam on the internet, at its peak accounting for nearly half of all spam sent globally - some 200 billion messages a day. Prolific spammer Initially it was not clear that the network had been tackled by law enforcement because the volume of spam coming out of Rustock has fluctuated wildly recently. Usually the spikes in activity last for 12 to 16 hours, Vincent Hanna of anti-spam group Spamhaus told BBC News. ""When Rustock stopped yesterday it was in mid-campaign,"" he said. Writing on Microsoft's public policy blog Richard Boscovich, a senior attorney in the company's Digital Crimes Unit, said the raids effectively severed the link between the million or so drone computers in Rustock and the servers that control them. Mr Boscovich said Rustock was a tough nut to crack because of the way it was organised. The swift seizure of servers should have denied Rustock's controllers any chance of simply shifting it to fresh machines, he said. The hard drives gathered in the raid would be be analysed so investigators can learn more about the way it ran and who was behind it. It said it would also work with ISPs to identify and clean up PCs that were unwitting participants in the Rustock botnet. Take down Disrupting the command and control infrastructure of a botnet is a Herculean task. It requires the co-ordination of security groups with insight in to how the botnet operates, the participation of law-enforcement agencies, domain name registrars and internet service providers that can potentially be located in different time zones, said Paul Wood, a security researcher at Symantec.cloud. ""One of the problems for law enforcers is deciding when to take action,"" he said. Once police know enough about a botnet to be able to take it down, they can collect an awful lot of intelligence about its owners, he added. Previous attempts to take down botnets have enjoyed mixed success. When security firm FireEye disabled the Mega-D botnet's command and control infrastructure in early November 2009, its owners were able to resume their activities within a month. ""Many of these botnets are run as businesses, so they have back-up plans in place,"" said Mr Wood. Persistent menace Often the infected computers that form a botnet are programmed to seek out websites where they can download new instructions, in the event that the command and control systems are breached. ""The botnet controllers can use legitimate websites - such as headlines from news sites - to identify where the new instructions can be found,"" said Mr Wood. Despite the success, the spread of botnets looks set to continue, as cyber crooks grow increasingly sophisticated in their ability to infect machines. ""The malware used embeds itself deep in the operating system, making it difficult to identify,"" said Mr Wood.","The sudden drop in activity of a major spam producer was the result of a large co-ordinated attack on spammers, it has emerged."
"Vehicles with no human driver on board were previously tested by a select group of Waymo customers, before the pandemic halted the service. The driver-free cars will initially be available only to friends and family of those early Waymo adopters, but will extend to all app users within weeks. The service comes two years later than originally promised. The cars will be remotely monitored, with vehicle operators intervening in extreme circumstances - such as a road ahead being closed. According to Ars Technica, cars will initially only cover a 50 sq mile (130 sq km) area in the Phoenix suburbs of Chandler, Tempe and Mesa. The company has yet to provide details on exactly how many people would be given access to the app that will allow them to hail the driverless taxis. The firm said: ""We expect our new driverless service to be very popular, and we're thankful to our riders for their patience as we ramp up availability to serve demand."" Waymo has around 600 cars in its fleet, but it did not say how many of these would operate in the new service. Before the pandemic, driver-free vehicles provided 5-10% of rides (out of 1,000-2,000 rides per week) in the designated zone around Phoenix. Later this year, the firm hopes to reintroduce rides with in-car vehicle operators, with barriers between the front and rear passenger seat, to ensure they are Covid-safe. The additional vehicles will ""add capacity and allow us to serve a large geographical area"", the company said. Chris Jones, an automotive analyst at research firm Canalys, said Waymo was currently the clear leader in driverless technology, and now had to persuade people to get in a car without a human driver. Coronavirus may prove an incentive. ""We have seen concerns about getting into a shared vehicle because of the pandemic - and Uber's bookings, for example, have dropped significantly,"" Mr Jones explained. ""People are familiar with Waymo - they have been testing in Phoenix for many years. Trust will be important as people ask, for example: would I put my daughter in a Waymo to take her to school?"" The next stage for the firm will be expanding its services to other cities around the US, he added. Waymo is currently running tests in around 25 locations.","People in Phoenix, Arizona will soon be able to order a driverless taxi, as Google expands its Waymo service."
"Posts which could identify the teens' age or location should only appear in searches by friends and ""friends of friends"" in the same age group. If an adult were to search for ""single females aged 17"", for example, no results would appear, it explained. Facebook said it was strict about its rules regarding age. If it had cause for concern about the age of any user - whether it thought they might be older or younger than claimed - it said it would suspend the suspect account and only reactivate it after seeing official government identification. It added that anyone aged under-17 could not share any of their posts publicly, and all location services were switched off by default, although they could be activated if the young person chose. Search test Facebook launched a test version of its search feature in January and it is currently limited to select users who have set English (US) as their language. The move has raised privacy concerns. One blog has gained fame for showing how the tool can be used to carry out potentially embarrassing searches, such as ""current employees of Tesco who like horses"". At the search facility's launch event the social network said it would take steps to protect its youngest users. The new restrictions - announced in a blog post - aim to fulfil this promise. In a social graph test carried out on the BBC's behalf, an adult searched for a specific school. The results only brought up accounts which appeared to belong to adults who had once attended, and over-17s who were still pupils. Mark Little, principal analyst at research firm Ovum, told the BBC at the time that he was ""underwhelmed"" by the search facility but could see commercial potential in it. ""I think it's going to help drive connections within the network between individuals and between companies and pages,"" he said. ""If you are increasing connections between friends and pages you are effectively increasing the reach of advertisers.""","The Facebook activity of users aged between 13 and 17 would have limited visibility in the network's new ""social graph"" search facility, the firm said."
"The company attracted 28 complaints per 100,000 customers for the service across the months of April to June. That meant BT was ranked worst out of the UK's major six providers for the fifth quarter in a row, despite the figure being lower than for the previous period. Its pay-TV service also struggled. BT TV attracted 13 complaints per 100,000 subscribers over the three months. The service has now had more complaints than its rivals in every Ofcom report since mid-2015. The industry average figures for the second quarter were: Ofcom's data represents only complaints consumers have chosen to escalate by referring them to the watchdog - and not those sent to individual firms or separate ombudsmen - so probably underplay the level of discontent. The body does not publish details about individual cases. But it said that common grievances against BT had included: ""We apologise to customers we've let down,"" said BT in a statement. ""We care about service and we've invested heavily to make improvements, including hiring 2,200 extra people, which is helping us answer calls more quickly than ever before - over eight out of 10 are now being answered in the UK and Ireland."" Ofcom's consumer policy chief did not refer to BT by name in her summary, but appeared to signal she wanted further action. ""We expect providers, particularly those who have been consistently under-performing, to make service quality and complaints handling their number one priority,"" said Jane Rumble. One market-watcher noted that BT's broadband service shared the same infrastructure - provided by its Openreach division - as Sky and EE, which were the two least complained about providers. ""The data we have from speed tests indicates BT isn't giving people a worse experience than others,"" said Andrew Ferguson from the ThinkBroadband news website. ""That suggests it's not got a broadband problem so much as a customer-service one - including the length of time it leaves people on hold... or worse when people try to call support, it takes them four or five times to get through.""","BT has continued its run as the UK's most complained about home broadband provider, according to data from the regulator Ofcom."
"It said tweets that could put people at a higher risk of contracting Covid-19 would be banned under the revised safety rules. That includes unverified claims that specific groups are more susceptible to coronavirus. It also covers denial of expert guidance, and unofficial advice about ways to diagnose or treat the virus. “We will enforce this in close co-ordination with trusted partners, including public health authorities and governments, and continue to use and consult with information from those sources when reviewing content,” Twitter said in a post on its website. Harmful content will be triaged, it added, prioritising removing tweets that “present the biggest risk of harm”. However, the BBC's technology correspondent, Rory Cellan-Jones, said there was no specific option to report tweets of this nature. “Given the sheer volume of disinformation from everyone from anti-5G campaigners to homeopaths pushing fake remedies, Twitter has set itself what looks like an impossible task,” he said. “It may also find itself accused of Western or liberal bias, as has happened with previous attempts to crack down on other kinds of disinformation. “And it is not clear how it expects the Twitter community to help – none of the categories for reporting a tweet specify misinformation.” It follows an announcement from Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Reddit earlier this week, in which they committed to work with governments to fight misinformation and to help connect those in self-isolation. “We are working closely together on Covid-19 response efforts,"" the joint-statement said. “We’re helping millions of people stay connected while also jointly combating fraud and misinformation about the virus, elevating authoritative content on our platforms and sharing critical updates in co-ordination with government healthcare agencies around the world.” Social media sites and search engines are already placing official guidance from the NHS and World Health Organization at the top of search results.",Twitter says it will remove content that promotes unverified claims and misinformation about coronavirus.
"The new measures include an early warning system for use during elections or when lives may be at risk, extra online education and improved access to impartial resources for voters. Major publishers, Google, Twitter and Facebook have helped devise the scheme. The BBC said the moves were ""crucial steps"" in fighting disinformation. It follows criticism of big technology firms for failing to do enough to prevent the spread of ""false news"" - from scares about vaccines to stories manufactured to influence elections. Other recent events such as this year's Indian elections have also highlighted the dangers of disinformation and the risk it poses to democracy. Earlier this summer, the BBC convened a Trusted News Summit, bringing together senior figures from major global technology firms and publishing to help tackle the problem. The group drew-up new plans including: BBC Director General Tony Hall said: ""Disinformation and so-called fake news is a threat to us all. At its worst, it can present a serious threat to democracy and even to people's lives. ""This summit has shown a determination to take collective action to fight this problem and we have agreed some crucial steps towards this."" Further details will be released at a later date.","Plans to help tackle so-called ""fake news"" have been announced by the BBC and some of the biggest names in journalism and technology."

"Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent@BBCRoryCJon Twitter There followed an apparently well informed account of events in the US town where a young black man had been shot dead by police. She went on to discuss with him America's troubled past when it came to race relations, and more words came tumbling from this often monosyllabic young man. Now, at the time of their discussion coverage in the UK mainstream media of the Ferguson story had been pretty sparse. In any case, our son watches barely any television and certainly does not read newspapers. Neither is he much of a user of social networks, having abandoned Facebook as ""boring"" and never joined Twitter. So where has he got his information? ""From friends in games, and from games forums,"" he explains. He does spend a lot of time online playing what seem to be very sociable games - League of Legends for instance - where live chat to other players is an important feature. He says many of his online friends are American and they have been talking about events in Ferguson. They share links to news stories and he has also found that gaming forums are full of chatter about it. This all set me thinking about the fast changing landscape that often seems a threat to the future of journalism. This week, for instance, the viral news-and-cats site Buzzfeed got a $50m investment from one of Silicon Valley's leading venture capital funds, and now has a valuation higher than old media giants like the Washington Post. (This, by the way is a subject we'll discuss on today's edition of Tech Tent). So is my anecdote good or bad news for the future of journalism? The positive side is that a 16-year-old - and many like him - is probably better informed this week about some global events than many older people who rely exclusively on the mainstream media. But, I hear you ask, what is the quality of the news he is absorbing - isn't it just a load of ill-informed internet gossip and social media backchat? Drilling down into what he actually read about Ferguson, it appears that much of it was on good old-fashioned news sites and written by professional journalists, perhaps even those working for the Washington Post, whose reporter was arrested by police in Ferguson this week. But how much longer will those journalists still be in jobs? The internet and indeed much of mainstream media is very good at opinion, instant analysis, and fast reports of breaking events. It is much less proficient in the often dull and expensive business of putting reporters on the ground everywhere from local council meetings to warzones to gather informed accounts of complex events. New media platforms like Buzzfeed and Vice will protest - with some justification - that they are now investing in journalism rather than simply repackaging other people's work. But the scope of that investment still looks very limited. Will Buzzfeed keep a reporter in Gaza, in Ukraine, even in smalltown America for years on end? Two conclusions then. Let's not be too depressed about teenagers and news because they are getting plenty of it, just via different means than their parents. But the challenge for journalists is to find new ways of reaching them while building a reputation as trusted guides to what is happening in the world. And, as we know, ""trust"" and ""journalist"" is not an obvious piece of word association for many people these days.","Any parent of a teenager, particularly one of the male variety, will know that their conversation can be, well, limited. So my wife was surprised earlier this week when our 16-year-old son suddenly asked her what she thought about ""this terrible stuff that's been happening in Ferguson""."
"By Dave LeeNorth America technology reporter Cloudflare, a San Francisco-based firm that provides added security for websites to prevent cyber-attacks, said it would stop protecting 8chan at midnight Pacific Time (08:00 BST) on Monday. The 21-year-old suspect in this weekend’s shooting in El Paso, Texas, is understood to have used 8chan to spread his manifesto. Previously, the site was also used by the suspect in March’s shooting in Christchurch, New Zealand, as well as the suspect in April's synagogue shooting in Poway, California. Losing Cloudflare’s protection has made 8chan vulnerable to a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, whereby a website is bombarded with traffic that overwhelms its servers, rendering it inaccessible. A few minutes after the Cloudflare service was withdrawn, 8chan did indeed become unavailable. However, 8chan's site administrator says it was moving to another security firm, BitMitigate, based in the US state of Washington. BitMitigate's website says it has ""a proven commitment to liberty"". BitMitigate stepped in to help neo-Nazi site the Daily Stormer when it lost Cloudflare protection in 2017. The BBC has approached BitMitigate for comment. But at this time 8Chan remains offline. Cloudflare chief executive Matthew Prince had said, in the wake of Saturday’s shootings, that his firm would continue to support 8chan as its policy was to remain neutral over the type of content the service protected. However, on Sunday evening Mr Prince wrote in a blog post that ""8chan has repeatedly proven itself to be a cesspool of hate”. “They have proven themselves to be lawless and that lawlessness has caused multiple tragic deaths,” Mr Prince wrote. ""Even if 8chan may not have violated the letter of the law in refusing to moderate their hate-filled community, they have created an environment that revels in violating its spirit.” Mr Prince warned that while 8chan would be disrupted by Cloudflare’s decision, it would likely be able to rebuild itself - as was the case when Cloudflare stopped providing protection for the Daily Stormer, a neo-Nazi site, in 2017. “They quickly came back online using a Cloudflare competitor,” Mr Prince wrote. ""That competitor at the time promoted as a feature the fact that they didn't respond to legal process. He added: ""I have little doubt we'll see the same happen with 8chan. While removing 8chan from our network takes heat off of us, it does nothing to address why hateful sites fester online. It does nothing to address why mass shootings occur. It does nothing to address why portions of the population feel so disenchanted they turn to hate. ""In taking this action we've solved our own problem, but we haven't solved the internet’s.” How do Cloudflare and BitMitigate services work? The two companies protect websites from attacks, as well as making websites load more quickly for legitimate users. They can be thought of as a kind of bouncer or security guard for websites that get a large amount of traffic, or may be a likely target of cyber-attacks. They use technology that can verify where internet traffic is coming from and what it is trying to do. They can distinguish whether the visitor is a genuine person, a network of automated bots that is being used to flood a website or requests that keep servers too busy to handle normal uses. They are meant to block any attempts from ""bad"" traffic getting through. Cloudflare provides protection for more than 12 million websites, and is expected to float on the stock market later this year. Chief executive Matthew Prince has expressed concern at the power his company has to decide whether or not a website is able to exist on the open internet. 8chan is a forum created in 2013 by Fredrick Brennan as an alternative to 4chan, a message board popular with gamers. 8chan promised less moderation of controversial topics and images that were being removed from 4chan. As such, 8chan has hosted far-right extremist views and imagery. Mr Brennan gave up ownership of 8chan in 2015 and has since called for it to be shut down. Following Cloudflare’s announcement, he wrote on Twitter: ""Thank you so much @CloudFlare Finally this nightmare might have an end.” 8chan is now owned and run by Jim Watkins, a former US army veteran, believed to be living in the Philippines. _____ Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC Do you have more information about this or any other technology story?

"By Leo KelionTechnology reporter The Linux-based software will allow users to run desktop apps on their handsets, allowing them to double for PCs when docked to monitors. The code will initially be released as a file which can be installed on Samsung's Galaxy Nexus phone, replacing Android. Some analysts question whether consumers really want the power of a fully fledged computer on their phone. Even so, Ubuntu's founder, Mark Shuttleworth, said he was in talks with manufacturers for devices to be sold with the system pre-installed within the year. While he acknowledged the innovation would likely be limited to ""enthusiasts and hobbyists"" at first, he said it signalled a wider shift on the horizon. ""It's quite incredible that we're at this point when the power of the phone is crossing over that with baseline processing power of basic laptops,"" Mr Shuttleworth told the BBC. ""We're taking advantage of that so for the first time in history you have the full consumer PC platform available on a phone. ""I'm very confident if we look ahead over the next three to five years that's a transition that Apple is going to have to make... and if it's not Windows 9 it will be Windows 10 that will see Microsoft bring its phone and laptop together into one device. It's really cracking to do that ahead of everyone else."" Phones running the software will be showcased at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas next week. Powerful apps Ubuntu is the most popular operating system to be based on the Linux kernel - the code that lets software and hardware work together. The London-based firm behind it, Canonical, offers it for download free of charge and has been helped by thousands of volunteers who contribute to the open source project. The firm makes money back by offering support and training and also plans to take a share of sales from online marketplaces offered by handset makers who adopt its software. It estimates that more than 20 million PCs already use it. In many cases these are older machines which benefit from the fact it is less demanding on computer power than Windows - and is virus-free. The new version has been designed to work on last and current-generation Android handsets which share the Linux kernel. This means Ubuntu can re-use existing software drivers to control the hardware. There are already 45,000 native apps for the system - albeit with several notable omissions such as Adobe's Photoshop and the Office suite, although alternatives do exist. Developers will be urged to adapt their apps' interfaces to look different when running on a phone's screen while offering the same core functionality. To offer touch-based controls Ubuntu has adopted the same QML (Qt modelling language) framework being utilised by the upcoming Blackberry 10 operating system. Mr Shuttleworth suggested this meant many app makers would be familiar with the technology. In addition Ubuntu can run web apps written in the widely-adopted HTML5 language. Advanced voice control When running on phones Ubuntu can be controlled by the ""head-up display"" (Hud) option it introduced last year. This allows users to type or say what command they want a program to carry out rather than having to click through menus. ""The Hud was born out of the phone design process,"" revealed Mr Shuttleworth. ""The key question we were asking is how do we allow developers to express some of the deeper richer functionality that you get typically in a desktop application when they write for a phone. ""Typically phone and tablet applications are streamlined slimmed-down versions of stuff that might have existed in a more sophisticated complicated form on the PC. ""And in our world where all of the functionality is there... you can invoke the Hud on the phone and talk to it with voice recognition instead of typing in your command - so you could say [for instance] you want a photo in a 1930s style - and our R&D effort is to make that natural."" Unconvinced about convergence A version of the code will shortly be made available to developers to start adapting their apps. The firm then plans to release a file for Galaxy Nexus phones by February, and later for other handsets and ultimately tablet computers as well. One analyst suggested the news would raise awareness of the Ubuntu system, but was sceptical about its chances of success. ""It's an impressive move by Ubuntu but ultimately I don't think it's a smart move,"" said Chris Green, principal technology analyst at Davies Murphy Group Europe. ""They are not the first company to try and drop a desktop operating system on a mobile device and nobody has ever been able to make it work. Microsoft tried to foist something that looked and felt like normal Windows on a mobile phone and they had to screw it up and develop a separate phone system. ""If you look at the platforms that thrive at the moment it's the ones that have diverged and had a platform designed for mobile on their mobile devices and a platform designed for conventional PCs on those.""",The Ubuntu operating system has been adapted to run on smartphones.
"By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor Last October, the Unicode Consortium - which represents many of the tech giants - had proposed including the weapon as one of several new Olympic-themed chat message graphics. At the time, the BBC reported that a British gun control campaign group had criticised the proposal, saying it was ""offensive"" to gun injury victims. A boxing glove and sword-wielding fencer were approved. However, another emoji - which showed a person firing a pistol to represent the ""modern pentathlon"" - was also dropped. According to a report by Buzzfeed, Apple and Microsoft both opposed the inclusion of new gun-themed graphics in the Unicode 9.0 list. Neither company has confirmed whether this was the case. ""There was consensus to remove them - I can't comment on the details,"" Unicode president Mark Davis told the BBC. The decision does not affect the existing pistol emoji, which was added in 2010. The move was welcomed by the campaigner who first criticised the rifle graphic. ""All those who have been traumatised by gun threats and gun violence will be grateful for this significant gesture of respect and support,"" said Chrissie Hall on behalf of the Gun Control Network. ""Images of guns can no longer be regarded as light-hearted additions to messages. They represent threats, and evoke fear of violence, suffering, pain and loss."" Beta test The Unicode Consortium maintains the emoji list to ensure different manufacturers' devices and apps can recognise chat graphics sent to and from each other. The images do, however, have a different look on each platform. Google had already added both of the new gun-related emojis to test versions of its next Android operating system ahead of the Unicode 9.0 list being approved. However, Mr Davies explained that this did not necessarily mean the search company had supported their inclusion. ""A beta version of a product will often use a beta version of an upcoming Unicode release, but then pick up the final version of the Unicode release before going into production,"" he said. ""That way they can be tested with an almost-final version of the Unicode characters and character properties."" The Unicode Consortium's attention now switches to its 10.0 list, due for release next year. Current suggestions include a dumpling, a fortune cookie and a face with one eyebrow raised.",A hunting rifle has been dropped from the latest list of official emojis.
"Dave LeeNorth America technology reporter The long-anticipated Tesla Semi has a range of 500 miles on a single charge. Tesla says the vehicle - known in the US as a semi-trailer truck - will go into production in 2019. Chief executive Elon Musk also unexpectedly revealed a new Roadster, which he said would be ""the fastest production car ever"" made. The red sports car was driven out of the trailer of the electric lorry during Tesla's presentation on Thursday. The Roadster will have a range of close to 1,000km (620 miles) on a single charge and will do 0-100mph in 4.2 seconds. Mr Musk described it as ""a hardcore smackdown to gasoline cars"". He said riding in traditional cars would be like driving ""a steam engine with a side of quiche"". The new Roadster becomes available in 2020. The Tesla Semi will achieve 0-60mph in 20 seconds when pulling 36,287kgs (80,000lbs), the maximum allowed on US roads. Speaking on stage at Tesla's facility in Los Angeles, chief executive Elon Musk said: ""It's not like any truck that you've ever driven."" However, the charismatic Mr Musk faces continued pressure from investors and customers as the firm struggles to meet demand for its Model 3 car. Model 3 delays The Model 3 is behind schedule due to factory delays, a situation Mr Musk described recently as “production hell”. The 46-year-old had been camping at Tesla’s Gigafactory in Reno, Nevada, to oversee battery production for the new cars. However, while the company had predicted it would make 1,500 Model 3 cars in the third quarter of 2017, in reality it only managed 260. Depending on your opinion of Mr Musk, launching a new truck at this time is either a bold statement of belief in his technology, and business as usual, or a foolish distraction from Tesla’s main goal of making its Model 3 a mainstream, affordable car. There are elements of the Model 3 in the Tesla Semi. Each of its wheels is powered by a Model 3 motor, and the cab features two of the touch screens displays found in the Model 3. Competitive market With Tesla Semi, Mr Musk enters a competitive, demanding market. There are an estimated 3.5 million truck drivers in the US, the vast majority of whom drive diesel-powered engines. Tesla will not be able to compete on diesel’s range, and battery specialists doubt Tesla can produce a powerful enough battery at a reasonable price. “A 300-mile-capable battery pack costs about $200,000,” a Carnegie Mellon study concluded. “Which is much higher than a diesel-powered semi-truck, which costs about $120,000, on average, for the entire vehicle.” Mr Musk said the Tesla Semi would be able to travel 643km (400 miles) after 30 minutes of charge at one of Tesla's new mega-chargers. The cost? As for cost, the company said that per mile the Tesla Semi would work out cheaper than a diesel equivalent when fuel and other maintenance is taken into consideration - but did not share the cost of an individual truck. The Diesel Technology Forum, a non-profit trade group that promotes the use of diesel, said Tesla’s announcement needed to be ""evaluated in the context of reality”. ""Diesel is the most energy efficient internal combustion engine,” Allen Schaeffer, the forum's executive director. ""It has achieved dominance as the technology of choice in the trucking industry over many decades and challenges from many other fuel types. ""Still, today, diesel offers a unique combination of unmatched features: proven fuel efficiency, economical operation, power, reliability, durability, availability, easy access to fuelling and service facilities, and now near-zero emissions performance."" As well as coming up against diesel incumbents, Tesla also faces other electric rivals. Concept electric big rigs have been unveiled by Daimler, Volkswagen and Cummins - though all fall short on range, and none are currently on the roads. Where Tesla believes it can bring an added advantage is with on-board safety and comfort. A statement from Tesla boasted that “jackknifing is prevented due to the Semi's onboard sensors that detect instability and react with positive or negative torque to each wheel while independently actuating all brakes"". ""The surround cameras aid object detection and minimise blind spots, automatically alerting the driver to safety hazards and obstacles. ""With Enhanced Autopilot, the Tesla Semi features Automatic Emergency Braking, Automatic Lane Keeping and Lane Departure Warning.” Autopilot is Tesla’s autonomous driving function that offers several self-driving features, most importantly guiding the vehicle to stay within the lines on the road, and slowing down in keeping with traffic up ahead.","Tesla has unveiled its first electric articulated lorry, designed to challenge diesel trucks as king of the road."
"The US leader said Sasha had recorded him discussing the social network at a family dinner and then quietly posted a reaction to her friends. It is not the first time the president has discussed his 15-year-old's online activities. In July, he said she also tweets, leading several media outlets to try to identify her account. It remains secret. Likewise a copy of the described Snapchat post has not been made public. Messages posted to the app are designed to disappear after being viewed or within a short period of time, but there are ways to circumvent the restrictions. Bored photo President Obama recounted the latest event on Monday's edition of the Jimmy Kimmel Live TV show. ""Sasha gave me instructions on Snapchat,"" he said. ""One night at dinner we're sitting there, and I had read that Snapchat was becoming really popular among her age cohort. So, I said: 'So, tell me about Snapchat.' ""So, she starts explaining stuff - you can make little faces on your picture, and this and that and the other. ""And at the end of it, Michelle and I are sitting there. And I said: 'Isn't this interesting?' ""And I started talking to Michelle about the implications of social media and what all this means. ""[And I] come to find out she was recording us the whole time, and then sent to her friends afterwards: 'This is my dad lecturing us on the meaning of social media.' ""And she took a picture of herself sort of looking bored."" The president added that his wife - who joined Snapchat in June - and his eldest daughter Malia had ""loved"" the post. The show's host, Jimmy Kimmel, joked that the event represented a security breach. Email leaks The president also mentioned that his own iPhone was limited to receiving emails and browsing the internet, and would not take photos, play music or make calls. ""My rule has been throughout my presidency, that I assume that someday, some time, somebody will read this email,"" he said. ""So, I don't send any email that at some point won't be on the front page of the newspapers."" Hillary Clinton - who is campaigning to be the next commander-in-chief - has been beset by a scandal over leaked emails, while her rival Donald Trump has been accused of using outdated software on his company's email servers. President Obama also said that he expected technology to preoccupy his successor. ""One of the biggest challenges... is going to be: how do we continue to get all the benefits of being in cyberspace but protect our finances, protect our privacy? ""How do we balance issues of security? Because people expect the government to monitor this enough to protect them from bad guys. ""But they worry that if government is in there too much, then who is going to protect them from government? ""This is going to be a big debate that we're going to have for a long time.""",President Barack Obama has disclosed that his younger daughter recently mocked him on Snapchat.
"The 'close contact detector' tells users if they have been near a person who has been confirmed or suspected of having the virus. People identified as being at risk are advised to stay at home and inform local health authorities. The technology shines a light on the Chinese government's close surveillance of its population. To make an inquiry users scan a Quick Response (QR) code on their smartphones using apps like the payment service Alipay or social media platform WeChat. Once the new app is registered with a phone number, users are asked to enter their name and ID number. Every registered phone number can then be used to check the status of up to three ID numbers. The app was jointly developed by government departments and the China Electronics Technology Group Corporation and supported by data from health and transport authorities, according to the state-run news agency Xinhua. It is widely known that the Chinese government conducts high levels of surveillance on its citizens but experts in the field suggest, in this case at least, it will not be seen as controversial within the country. Hong Kong-based technology lawyer at the law firm DLA Piper Carolyn Bigg told the BBC: ""In China, and across Asia, data is not seen as something to be locked down, it's something that can be used. Provided it's done in a transparent way, with consent where needed."" ""From a Chinese perspective this is a really useful service for people... It's a really powerful tool that really shows the power of data being used for good,"" she added. The Chinese government defines 'close contact' as coming near to, with no effective protection, confirmed, suspected or mild cases of the coronavirus while the person was ill, even if they were showing no symptoms at the time. 'Close contact' covers: For example, all air passengers within three rows of an infected person, as well as cabin staff, are seen as being in close contact, while other passengers would be recorded as having general contact.

"By Katia MoskvitchTechnology reporter, BBC News This one is a little smoother and quieter than most. It's electric, and like all battery-operated automobiles needs regular charging. But the top-up process is different from the usual hassle of plugging a bulky cable into a specially designed socket. Here, the driver doesn't even need to get out. ""The charging is done wirelessly, you park up, turn off the key and voila... charging starts automatically,"" says Anthony Thomson, CEO of HaloIPT, a UK company that has installed the technology. The process uses electromagnetic induction to transfer power from a pad built into the ground to another installed in the bottom of the car. The system could be installed in a supermarket parking place, garage floor or the ground at a special charging station. When a driver parks the vehicle, the two pads line up and with a flick of a switch, the charging starts. Induction The phenomenon of electromagnetic induction was discovered by British physicist Michael Faraday in 1831. He found that when two coils were placed close to each other and power applied to one of them, it produced a magnetic field, which then induced a voltage across the second coil. In the case of charging a car, the coils are embedded inside the two pads. The system was originally developed at the University of Auckland in New Zealand, and commercialised by HaloIPT. And although some of the electricity inevitably gets wasted during the charging process, people who have tried it have praised its simplicity. Two of the induction-equipped C1s have been taking part in the Coventry and Birmingham Low Emission Demonstrators (CABLED) consortium - the world's biggest trial of electric vehicles. ""City planners don't like the prospect of a line of charge posts down streets, adding to the existing street clutter,"" said Neil Butcher, the CABLED project leader, who has been driving one of the two cars since May 2011. ""The lack of any visible connection minimises any risk of vandalism - unplugging or theft of cables. ""There are also obvious health and safety issues associated with many live electric cables hanging between the post and the car, especially in bad weather, including electric shock and trip hazards,"" added Mr Butcher. But with wireless power transfer, bad weather is not a problem, claims HaloIPT. Pads remain perfectly operational and safe in any conditions, ""sending"" the energy up, even through a layer of snow. As simple as the process might sound, there is a catch - there are currently no charging stations in the UK. So Mr Butcher can only feed his hungry Citroen at his garage where the system has been installed as part of a pilot project. As a back-up he can switch to a conventional plug-in cable charging point. But HaloIPT is certain that things will improve in the future, and induction stations will become commonplace. One of their first visitors may be a Rolls Royce. The luxury carmaker has equipped its latest electric model, the 102EX Phantom Experimental Electric with a magnetic induction plate. And the technology is being deployed in more down-to-earth modes of transport. Italian buses A fleet of city buses equipped with special pads has been navigating the streets of two Italian cities, Genoa and Turin, since 2002. Corresponding pads have been embedded into the pavement at certain bus stops - to charge the vehicles on the go. ""The buses have signs that they are electric, and people say that they like the experience - the buses are a lot smoother than diesel ones,"" said Mathias Wechlin from Conductix-Wampfler, a German company that, just like HaloIPT, originally sprung from the University of Auckland and now licenses the technology. Mr Wechlin adds that, during charging time, people stay inside the buses - something he says is absolutely safe, as the strength of the magnetic field produced is within the limits recommended by the International Commission on non-ionizing radiation protection (ICNIRP). Although the safety issue may indeed seem worrisome, Professor Paul Mitcheson from Imperial College London, who has studied the effects of electromagnetism on people, says there should not be a problem. ""The whole concept of efficient wireless charging of vehicles relies on near-field, non-radiative coupling between the charging point and the receiver on the vehicle. ""It is not possible to design a system with no radiation, but a well-designed system can have negligible levels of radiation well below safety limits provided by the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) standard."" Despite the electric buses project in Italy being a success on a small scale, the company has found it tricky to expand the operation. The main reason has been the difficulty in convincing municipalities to get on board, said Mr Wechlin, as electric buses are usually a lot more expensive than petrol or diesel powered ones. In Turin and Genoa, the situation was different. Officials decided to invest some money in trialling alternative transport systems, and electric buses seemed a perfect option. But when they raised the idea of plug-in technology, the union of bus drivers voted against their members plugging in cables on health and safety grounds. That was when Conductix-Wampfler offered to go wireless. The initiative resulted in eight buses in Genoa and another 23 in Turin. Mr Wechlin said that besides pure convenience, the system also significantly increases the time the bus can remain in operation as it does not need to go to the depot every few hours for recharging and there is no need to swap batteries. ""With wireless charging, the buses are charged at the end of the route, where they change direction and stand for about five to ten minutes - and those little rechargings allow you to keep the bus in operation from 7am till 8pm,"" he told the BBC. WiTricity But electromagnetic induction is not the only method used for wireless charging. A US start-up business WiTricity, founded by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Professor Marin Soljačić, has patented a new way to wirelessly transfer energy in much larger amounts and over greater distances than induction. The technique, called highly coupled magnetic resonance, involves pairing the magnetic fields of two pads with closely matching resonant frequencies. ""When you plug one pad into the wall, that electricity is converted into a magnetic field, which oscillates at a frequency,"" explained WiTricity CEO Eric Giler. ""It creates a second magnetic field that oscillates around the second coil that sits underneath the car, and it is then converted into electricity that goes to a charger inside the car and charges the battery."" The company has received a lot of attention since WiTricity demonstrated the technology at the 2009 TED conference. Electronics giant Intel started experimenting with it in their labs, and some recent reports suggest that Apple is investigating wireless charging for the iPhone 6. In March 2011, carmaker Toyota invested in the start-up and signed a deal to develop wireless charging for its future electric cars. Mr Giler said that besides Toyota, WiTricity has been in contact with virtually all the biggest car companies around the world. And just like Mr Thomson of HaloIPT and Mr Wechlin of Conductix-Wampfler, he believes that sooner or later, automakers will have to go wireless. ""Car manufacturers have already realised that if you don't have to plug a car in to charge it, it will significantly increase the adoption of the electric vehicles,"" he said. With global oils supplies depleting, the hope is that wireless charging might be the killer feature that attracts drivers to electric vehicles. And maybe one day, if the technology gets embedded into streets and motorways, drivers won't even have to worry about charging at all.",The Citroen C1 springs to life and leaps forward with the enthusiasm only a French city runaround can muster.
"By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter It will stock the most popular books from Amazon.com, and the prices will be the same as those offered on the website. Customers will also be able to try out Amazon's devices, including the Kindle and its Fire TV. Rival bookseller Waterstones said it hoped the venture ""falls flat on its face"". Amazon Books vice-president Jennifer Cast announced the online giant would open its ""real, wooden doors"" at the Seattle University Village on 3 November. ""Amazon Books is a physical extension of Amazon.com. We've applied 20 years of online bookselling experience to build a store that integrates the benefits of offline and online book shopping,"" she said. The shop will stock 5,000 books in the 5,500-sq-ft (510-sq-m) space, with the majority chosen on the basis of customer ratings, pre-orders, sales, popularity on reader recommendation site Goodreads, and the shop's curators' assessments. James Daunt, managing director of Waterstones, was unimpressed, particularly with the decision to display books mainly ""face out"". ""With only 5,000 titles in a space in which Waterstones would put over 10 times that number, it appears to be a tentative dip of the toe into physical bookselling waters. ""Clearly, however, a skim of the bestsellers away from true bookshops would be very damaging: we very much hope that it falls flat on its face."" Waterstones recently said that it would stop selling Amazon's Kindle in its stores. Online, offline Tom Tivnan, features editor at the Bookseller magazine, questioned why the online giant was experimenting with a bricks-and-mortar store. ""It goes against the Amazon model of being a never-ending bookshop that is not reliant on having books on shelves,"" he said. ""It is unclear whether they will roll it out across the US. ""I can see it going to a limited number of cities like New York or possibly London, but I don't think it will have a huge impact."" The lines between online and offline are becoming increasingly blurred. In the spring, Google launched a shop based at Currys PC World on London's Tottenham Court Road, stocking a range of Google products, including Android phones and tablets and Chromebook laptops.","Amazon is opening a bookshop in Seattle in a move it described as a ""physical extension"" of its business."
"The new ad space lets app-makers advertise on the App Store search tab, rather than just in the search results. Last week's release of iOS 14.5 placed strict limits on tracking on iPhones - including tracking for advertising. And Facebook fiercely opposed the change, warning it would favour Apple's own advertising system. Apple's App Tracking Transparency feature requires apps on iPhones to ask for permission to track the user for advertising. During a long-running row between the two, Facebook had warned Apple's ""privacy"" features would hurt advertisers - including app makers - and benefit Apple. ""Apple's policies leave very limited options for app developers to find customers through effective advertising - and, conveniently, Apple's own advertising products is one of them,"" Facebook had said. 'Increased demand' Previously, Apple sold adverts to appear at the top of search results only. The new slot effectively doubles the advertising space for sale. Enders Analysis senior media analyst Jamie MacEwan said: ""The timing makes sense. ""Apple probably anticipates increased demand for exposure on the App Store. That's because Apple's iOS privacy changes have made other options less attractive."" Ad campaigns on other sites had less reliable measurements of success, he said. And app developers ran ads only if they were sure the cost of winning new customers was lower than the amount they would spend on the app. ""As its ads business grows, Apple will have to make sure its execution on consent and privacy is impeccable"" to avoid accusations of putting itself first, Mr MacEwan added. Some reports suggest Apple's ad sales could be worth more than $2bn and are growing. Apple has not responded to a request for comment on the timing of the new advertising product launch. Legal battle The new feature also comes as internal Apple emails reveal a tension in the company over its advertising business. The emails, between Apple employees in 2015, discussed the possibility of adding adverts to the App Store, after Google launched them for its own Android store. The documents emerged as part of Apple's continuing legal battle with Epic Games and were first reported on by Apple news site 9to5Mac. Apple anti-fraud unit head Eric Friedman was discussing the idea of ads with engineer David Neumann, the documents reveal, and how they could work better for app discovery than a ""top apps"" chart. ""The dev[eloper]s would love it,"" Mr Friedman wrote. ""The problem is that [Apple chief executive Tim Cook] is telling the world that we make great products without monetising users. ""Ads would be weirdly at odds with that."" Mr Cook has long criticised big technology companies for monetising users' data, whereas Apple makes most of its money through selling high-end devices. Apple ended up introducing its first App Store ads in mid-2016, more than a year after those emails. But the number of ads it displays remains low compared with rival Google Play, or most social networks.","Apple has added extra paid-for advertisements to its App Store, a week after its new operating system limited tracking for ads from other companies."
"Mr Stone was a long-time political strategist and is an ally of US President Donald Trump. He was convicted of lying to Congress in 2019. He has denied involvement with the misinformation network. Facebook also said it had identified a network of fake accounts run by employees of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro's government. The social network released details of four misinformation campaigns ahead of the July edition of its monthly report on co-ordinated inauthentic behaviour. ""Campaigns like these raise a particularly complex challenge by blurring the line between healthy public debate and manipulation,"" Facebook said. What was linked to Stone? Facebook said it had removed 54 accounts, 50 pages, and four Instagram accounts it had linked to Mr Stone. About 260,000 accounts followed one or more of the Facebook pages. The inauthentic pages posted about Mr Stone's websites, books, and media appearances; local politics; and material leaked by Wikileaks ahead of the US 2016 election. Meanwhile, the fake profiles posed as Florida residents and commented on the posts to make them look more popular. In total, those behind the pages spent about $308,000 on Facebook advertising. Facebook said several of the inauthentic pages had links to Proud Boys, a white-supremacist hate group it had banned in 2018. ""Roger Stone's personal accounts and his branded assets will be coming down as part of this network,"" said Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook's head of cyber-security policy. ""We saw them deeply enmeshed in the activities here."" Mr Stone told a New York Times reporter: ""I have never owned or controlled any fake Facebook, Twitter or Instagram accounts."" What about Brazil? Facebook has also removed 35 accounts, 14 pages, a Facebook group and 38 Instagram accounts that it says were involved in inauthentic behaviour in Brazil. It said those responsible had created ""fictitious personas posing as reporters"" and had ""masqueraded as news outlets"". The pages posted political memes; criticism of the political opposition, media organisations and journalists; and about the coronavirus pandemic. Facebook said it had linked the accounts to employees in the offices of President Jair Bolsonaro, his sons Eduardo and Flávio, and special adviser Tércio Arnaud, among others. Flávio Bolsonaro, a senator, said it was possible to find thousands of profiles supporting the Bolsonaro government, and to his knowledge ""they are all free and independent"". Analysis By Marianna Spring, disinformation and social media reporter Most noteworthy here are the two separate sets of inauthentic accounts - one allegedly connected to former Trump adviser Roger Stone, the other to employees of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. It's indicative of the evolution of political influence campaigns - although in the case of Mr Stone the aims appear more personal, with accounts promoting his books and Facebook pages. The network that Facebook says is linked to the employees of President Bolsonaro seemed to have more ambitious targets, spreading disinformation and bolstering pro-government political narratives within Brazil. News pages run by inauthentic accounts were used to promote conspiracies and criticise opponents of the Brazilian government, according to Facebook. Some of the conspiracies that were plugged are ones that have been promoted by the Brazilian president himself - for instance, suggesting that coronavirus death tolls have been exaggerated by media outlets. It adds to growing concerns about the use of co-ordinated online networks to target Mr Bolsonaro's opponents - and reveals techniques used around the world to spread disinformation, such as posting as news pages and PR companies. Facebook also shared details of a disinformation campaign in Ukraine, which it said it had linked to a local advertising agency. It also banned Canada-based PR firm Estraterra for its involvement in a foreign interference campaign targeting El Salvador, Argentina, Uruguay, Venezuela, Ecuador and Chile.","Facebook has removed a disinformation network it says was linked to ""Roger Stone and his associates""."
"The UK company, Mediatonic, said the update would be implemented within the next two weeks. Since the game launched, in August, players have found ways to cheat, such as flying or running faster than the default settings. The developer apologised and thanked fans for their patience. ""We're really sorry about the cheating problem,"" the studio tweeted. ""We're expanding the current detection system this week to improve things. ""We also have a big update in the next couple of weeks that adds the same anti-cheat used by games such as Fortnite."" Fortnite's developer, Epic Games, has taken legal action against some players over cheating. Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout players select a jellybean character they can customise them with lots of different outfits to compete in a giant colourful obstacle course. Each match begins with 60 players and is broken into five rounds of mini-games. After each round, losing players are removed from the game until just one player is left as the winner. It is currently available to play on Microsoft Windows and the Sony PlayStation 4 only but has already become the most downloaded game so far on online gaming service PlayStation Plus. The game sold more than seven million units on Steam for PC within its first month of launch and has rarely been out of the top of the charts. Mediatonic - founded by Dave Bailey and Paul Croft, in 2005, their final year at Brunel University - has offices in London, Brighton and Madrid.","Popular video game Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout will use the same anti-cheat system as Fortnite, its developer has announced."
"In a blog post, Mr Koum sought to reassure users that Facebook's $19bn (£11bn) purchase of the firm would not change core principles. ""Respect for your privacy is coded into our DNA,"" he wrote. The post comes in the wake of complaints to US regulators by privacy advocates about Facebook's purchase. Mr Koum referenced his childhood in Ukraine in the 1980s, and wrote that ""the fact that we couldn't speak freely without the fear that our communications would be monitored by KGB is in part why we moved to the United States when I was a teenager"". He said he would not have allowed the firm to be acquired by Facebook if it meant changing core WhatsApp policies like not asking for users' names, email addresses or birthdays. He said he would not allow user data to be used for advertising. ""Speculation to the contrary isn't just baseless and unfounded, it's irresponsible,"" he added. ""It has the effect of scaring people into thinking we're suddenly collecting all kinds of new data. That's just not true."" Privacy concerns WhatsApp currently makes money by selling a $0.99 subscription to users. Mr Koum previously railed against advertising in a 2012 blog post. But privacy advocates have asked US regulators to block the purchase, arguing that Facebook has a long history of promising not to use user data for advertising purposes, only to do just that. In a filing with the Federal Trade Commission, two privacy groups - the Electronic Privacy Information Center and the Center for Digital Democracy - argued that WhatsApp users provided the firm with personal data under the assumption it would not be shared. ""Users provided detailed personal information to the company including private text to close friends. Facebook routinely makes use of user information for advertising purposes and has made clear that it intends to incorporate the data of WhatsApp users into the user profiling business model,"" wrote the groups. ""The proposed acquisition will therefore violate WhatsApp users' understanding of their exposure to online advertising and constitutes an unfair and deceptive trade practice, subject to investigation by the Federal Trade Commission."" The FTC has not yet said whether it will open an investigation.","WhatsApp founder Jan Koum has spoken out against ""careless and inaccurate"" reports about possible changes to the messaging app's privacy policies."
"By Kevin RawlinsonBBC News The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) said it hoped to resolve the dispute during a round of talks, but noted that it had enforcement powers available should they fail. Google said it was taking its responsibilities seriously. The news comes exactly one year since the controversial ruling by the Court of Justice of the European Union. Along with other search engines, the internet giant has been obliged to remove links to articles that contain ""inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant"" information about an individual. Under the decision, the person named must make a request to have the links removed from the results for a specific search. Google has consistently said that it considers it a mistake to make it the arbiter in such cases, as the ruling effectively does. The ICO confirmed to the BBC that it was discussing 48 cases it believed Google had not got ""quite right"" and has asked the internet giant to revise its decisions. The action available to the ICO, should the discussions over those cases fail, includes a fine and a legally binding enforcement notice that could lead to court action, if the firm refused to comply. But the body would only take such action if it found that Google's processes were not fit for purpose, rather than as a direct reaction to a single complaint. An ICO spokesman said: ""Since the details of the right to be forgotten ruling were first announced, we have handled over 183 complaints from those unhappy with Google's response to their takedown request. ""In around three-quarters of these cases, we have ruled that Google was correct to turn down an individual's request to have their information removed. This suggests that, for the most part, Google are getting the balance right between the protection of the individual's privacy and the interest of internet users."" But, it said, there were still a ""significant number of cases where we believe Google haven't got it quite right and they have been asked to revise their decision"". While Google has done so in ""many cases"", the ICO said it was ""looking to resolve the remaining cases through discussion and negotiation with Google, though we have enforcement powers available to us if required"". A Google spokesman said: ""We haven't always got privacy right in Europe, not just because of errors we've made, but our attitude too. But our swift and thoughtful implementation of the right to be forgotten ruling showed that for Google this was a genuine 'we get it' moment. ""We've also worked hard to give users more control over the data we collect and we're looking at how to make those tools easier to find and use. So stay tuned."" Free speech campaigners have claimed that the ruling makes it easier for people to hide negative - though fair and accurate - references to them online and there have been sites set up to track the links taken down. The BBC said in October 2014 that it would publish a list of its articles to which links have been taken down. A spokesman said on Wednesday that that remained its intention, though a decision on when and where to publish has not yet been taken. However, others have pointed out that the ruling helps people avoid bad news stories unfairly dominating the results of searches related to them. Google has said that it has received more than 250,000 requests to remove about 920,000 links, of which 41.3% have been removed from its search results, according to its transparency report. While the ruling only applies to European sites, the deputy information commissioner David Smith told the Times that he believed Google should remove links on its US domain as well. The ICO is also running a review of websites and apps used by children, it announced on Tuesday. It will look at how information collection is explained and what parental permission is sought on 50 websites and apps. It said: ""The same approach will be taken by 28 other privacy enforcement authorities from around the world, with a view to publishing a combined report in the autumn. The ICO will also consider action against any website or app that it finds to be breaking the Data Protection Act.""","Google is in talks with regulators over nearly 50 ""right to be forgotten"" cases it is accused of getting wrong."
"By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor Last week, Viettel demoed a video call saying it had used 5G network hardware and software developed in-house. It added that it aimed to commercialise the technology later this year. But experts say high research costs and others' ownership of critical patents would make it a difficult sector to break into in any meaningful way. Viettel - which is controlled by Vietnam's military - suggested its engineers had developed the radio base station involved after just six months of work, during which they had ""officially mastered 5G network technology"". ""Currently, five companies have successfully produced network devices for 5G including Ericsson, Nokia, Huawei, Samsung and ZTE,"" the company added in a Vietnamese-language press release. ""Viettel will be the sixth supplier in the world to produce this device [and the] only operator that is capable of producing its own network equipment."" It said it intended to launch civil and military 5G services in the country from June. The release also quoted Chu Ngoc Anh, the country's science and technology minister, as saying: ""This presents a very rare opportunity to create a research and development platform that Vietnam can develop further."" Royalty fees Viettel first announced plans to use its own 5G equipment last August, when it said it would supplement it with kit from the European vendors Ericsson and Nokia. This bucked a trend in other South East Asian countries to use Huawei's products. At the time, Viettel's chief, Major General Le Dang Dung, said that he was concerned about reports ""that it's not safe to use Huawei"", although he added that if he received ""favourable information"" about the Chinese firm in the future, he might reconsider. One industry analyst said he thought it unlikely that Viettel was now poised to become a serious competitor in its own right. ""It cost the other players billions of dollars to develop their own 5G portfolios and they didn't do it overnight,"" commented Dan Bieler, an analyst at Forrester Research. ""I'm sceptical from a perspective of how much capital expenditure Viettel really has available to fund such research and then manufacture these products. ""If this is only about using certain components it has manufactured and designed, then that would not be such a huge story - but it's a very large claim to suggest it is in the same league as Nokia, Ericsson and Huawei."" Another expert also expressed reservations. ""Even if it they could get past other hurdles, Viettel would have to pay patent and royalty fees to the likes of Qualcomm, Huawei and Ericsson, which would make it financially unrealistic to create and sell its own infrastructure,"" suggested Dimitris Mavrakis, from ABI Research. ""It would have to pay exorbitant amounts - the technology specifications and the intellectual property rights are very tightly controlled. ""It's not as if anyone can just jump in and create their own, otherwise other industry giants like AT&T, Verizon and Vodafone would also have done the same."" In addition to being Vietnam's largest network operator, Viettel also offers services in 10 other countries across Asia, Latin America and Africa. And a third market-watcher was more positive about its potential in that light. ""Vietnam has been following China in its economic development with a 10-year lag - both have been remarkably good at investing in hi-tech and have taken the 5G opportunity seriously,"" said Stephane Teral from IHS Markit. ""I expect Viettel to remain focused on its home Viet Nam turf, and then, move to its foreign footprints in Burundi, Cambodia, Cameroon, East Timor, Haiti, Laos, Mozambique, Myanmar, and Tanzania - deploying 5G where the established vendors are not because they remain focused on more lucrative markets, and de facto become a sixth force.""",A Vietnamese firm's claim to be a fresh force in 5G network equipment is being treated with scepticism by industry experts.
"November's average broadband speed was 7.6 megabits per second, up from 6.8Mbps in May, says the regulator. Upgrades offered by Virgin Media and BT helped boost the figure. Ofcom says many of the 42% of homes which subscribe to speeds of 10Mbps or less would benefit from switching deal or provider at little or no cost. The 22% headline speed bump is a notable improvement, according to the price comparison website broadbandchoices.co.uk. ""In reality, the average speed increase of 1.4Mbits will save you around 6 minutes when downloading a 2 hour film,"" said Michael Philips, the firm's product director. ""This doesn't sound a lot but faster connections improve your general web-surfing experience and are definitely worth the investment, for example if more than one person shares the connection in a household."" Ofcom noted that the price difference between many of the so-called super-fast services and current generation connections was ""relatively small"". It said some Plusnet customers could roughly double their promised speed to ""up to"" 40Mbps by swapping to a service with the firm that cost £5 more a month. It said TalkTalk clients could enjoy a similar gain by paying their provider an extra £10 a month, while one of BT's deals offered an equivalent speed bump at no extra charge. Marketing restrictions The figures are contained in Ofcom's sixth study into residential fixed-line broadband performance. It is the first report since internet service providers were told they would only be able to claim a maximum speed if it was available to 10% of their customers. The new rules come into effect in April. Using them as a guide Ofcom provided a breakdown of its figures saying that: The regulator said speed upgrades offered by Virgin Media and BT accounted for most of the period's gains. Virgin Media's ""up to"" 50Mbps cable deal was the fastest surveyed offering average download speeds of nearly 49Mbps. The firm's 100Mbps service was not included in the research. BT's roll-out of FFTC (fibre to the cabinet) technology helped boost its statistics. The move involves running fibre from its exchanges to street cabinets which are then linked to homes by normal telephone lines. Since the cabinets are closer to most homes than the exchanges, users enjoy faster speeds. It has led to the creation of the firm's Infinity offer which promises ""up to"" 40Mbps. The service was found to provide an average speed of 36Mbps. 'Disappointing' The study said that other ISPs ""did not change significantly"" over the six months. Orange's ""up to"" 20Mbps ADSL service fared worst out of the maximum-speed offers surveyed. It was found to provide average download speeds of 7.2Mbps. The firm said it believed the next report would show an improvement. ""It's disappointing to see the outcome of this survey, although it was not unexpected as it was conducted last year as we were moving a large number of our customers to our new broadband network,"" a statement said. ""Since this time, we have completed the migration and the vast majority of our customers have seen a significant improvement in the download speeds they receive."" The news site thinkbroadband.com said the research also highlighted the need for investment in out-of-town connections. ""Rural areas have an average of 3.3Mbps versus urban at 8.8Mbps,"" said the firm's editor Andrew Ferguson. Ofcom says it plans to publish the next report in July, using data collected from tests run in May. Summary of data speeds sampled by Ofcom in November 2011:","The UK's average home download speed is on the rise, but it could be even faster if more users upgraded at minimal cost, according to Ofcom."
"By Prof Alan WoodwardDepartment of Computing, University of Surrey This feature has proved particularly helpful to hackers, many of whom have developed a feeling of invulnerability, and even boast that they will never be caught. However, the arrests of members of the hacker group Lulzsec this week, and some other recent but less high-profile arrests, show that the authorities are not quite as impotent as many would have you believe. Increasingly, hackers' boasts are followed shortly afterwards by a surprise visit from the local police. So, how do these investigators catch these new-age criminals? Internet addresses To start, one needs to take a step back and understand how it is that people can obscure their identity on the internet. Most people rightly assume that if you connect to the internet you are given a unique address (your IP address), and, not unreasonably, people assume this could be used to trace back any activity emanating from that address to an individual. And sure enough, given an IP address, anyone can look up the details of where that IP address originates: there are many publicly available services on the internet that anyone can use. However, it is not that simple, and certainly not quick, for several reasons. Firstly, many years ago the number of devices on the internet requesting an IP address exceeded the number of possible addresses. Consequently, when any of us asks our internet service provider (ISP) to connect us, whilst we are given an IP address it is only leased to us. These IP addresses typically expire quite quickly at which point it is renewed if you continue to want access or it is given to someone else if we have disconnected. Your next connection provides you with a completely different address. Look up an address and it will usually only tell you who the ISP is, not who held the lease at a specific time. So, even if an investigator saw illegal activity emanating from a specific address, it is unlikely that they would easily be able to track down the user using publicly available data. The authorities would have to go to the service provider and ask for their records to show exactly who was using that address at the time of the illegal activity. As law enforcement agencies have to obey the law this usually requires a warrant issued by a judge, all of which requires the investigators to show that illegal activity was under way and that it appeared to be coming from a particular ISP. They cannot simply go on a fishing trip. Nonetheless, investigators have become more and more proficient at this process, so hackers (at least the ones that have not been caught yet) have long since ceased to rely upon this although most rightly assume that it will slow down the authorities and make them less agile than the hackers. Co-ordination complications Secondly, all of the above assumes that the service providers keep records of who had a particular lease. In the UK they do, but not every country is quite that diligent, and certainly not necessarily to the level of detail required to physically locate a miscreant. Even in the UK, the volume of data is enormous and it cannot be kept indefinitely. The UK is introducing legislation to oblige ISPs to keep records but even that does not require those records to be kept for ever. Thirdly, being a global network, the internet comes under multiple jurisdictions. If it takes time for an investigator to be granted a warrant in his or her own country, imagine the difficulty of doing so in another country. So it's not surprising then that most hackers tend to attack sites outside their own country. Moreover, hackers co-operate across jurisdictions adding further complexity to an already tricky situation. However, this week has highlighted the role of cross-border co-operation with arrests being made in UK, Ireland and the US. Increasingly, international bodies such as Interpol and Europol are taking a lead in enabling collaboration between the agencies in several countries simultaneously. Proxy defence So, assuming you can navigate all of the above complexities, you can track back an internet address, and catch your perpetrator? Well, not necessarily. As ever the technology runs well ahead of the legislative and judicial systems. Today there are a couple more tricks that allow you to cover your tracks on the net. The most widely used is called the proxy. Using a proxy server anyone can bounce their activity off a system that is either in a far distant country, or keeps no records of where the activity originated, or worse still, both. Proxies gained popularity among those doing illegal downloads - so that they could not be traced. Proxy services are widely available, often for free. They have developed a very important role in allowing people in hostile regimes to have their say anonymously. But, of course, they can also be misused for illegal purposes. And so besides those undertaking illegal activities such as copyright theft, the hackers have been quick to realise their potential. But all is not lost even at this stage. The investigators can do what they call ""traffic analysis"" which relies upon using a combination of records from several ISPs, and in this way cut the proxy service provider out of the loop. Not surprisingly this takes even longer and the added complexity inevitably means less reliable results when trying to secure a prosecution. However, one of the big advantages that the authorities have is that they are patient: they don't boast about what they are doing, quite the opposite, and they are prepared to grind through the detail to get their man or woman. The dark web Of course, the hackers know all of this and so the arms race has continued. Most hackers now, in addition to relying on all of the above, use what is called ""onion routing"". Perversely it began as research to protect US Naval Communications, but ever since the technique was published at the Information Hiding Workshop in 1996, people have seen it as a general means of maintaining anonymity on the internet. The most widely used is called Tor. Again it has many valid uses, but the hackers are delighted to use it as well. It is projects such as Tor that represent the front line for investigators today. Currently they have very little answer to onion routing, and when combined with the other complexities I've outlined the law enforcers face a significant challenge. But do not write them off just yet. Global service providers are working with researchers on projects such as BT's Saturn which was originally developed to identify threats to the UK's critical national infrastructure. But in the past year it has been used for some very interesting purposes. The example shown here is snapshot showing sources (red) of intrusion attempts and destination (green) of those intrusions. The size of the circle indicates the number of events. Watch that space for more developments. Dominos Meanwhile, enter good old-fashioned police work. The principle is simple: everyone makes mistakes. Take the case of the hacker known as Sabu. He regularly talked to others using internet relay chat (IRC). Reading messages allegedly from Sabu, apparently leaked by his fellow disgruntled hackers, he was quite boastful about what he had attacked, his invulnerability and his technical prowess. He therefore set himself up as an obvious target for surveillance. It appears that just once, Sabu logged into his IRC chat service without using Tor. His IP address was revealed and the FBI traced him. That led to charges against other suspected hackers. You will see more of this tactic: decapitate by arresting the big fish and then attempt to sweep up the smaller fry based on what you learn. In short, a lack of news does not mean that the hackers have it all their own way, despite what they might like you to think. Whilst the arms race continues in cyberspace, what has become clear is that what works is the combination of the old and the new. Prof Alan Woodward is a visiting professor at the University of Surrey's department of computing.","The internet has gained a reputation as somewhere you can say and do anything with impunity, primarily because it is easy to disguise your identity."
"The firm said it wanted to conduct extra tests following screen problems reported by early reviewers of Samsung's Galaxy Fold. Both firms had unveiled the devices in February but Huawei said it now wanted to be ""cautious"". Samsung currently has no release date for the Fold. Huawei confirmed to the BBC that the Mate X is expected to launch in September 2019. ""We don't want to launch a product to destroy our reputation,"" it told CNBC. ""The Mate X was always going to come later than Samsung's Galaxy Fold, but the Korean phone-maker's problems have certainly given Huawei more breathing space,"" said Ben Wood from CCS Insight. ""There is little doubt Huawei will have learned lessons from Samsung's problems and - given the extra scrutiny the Mate X will get as a result - Huawei is well advised to ensure it has every eventuality covered."" Huawei has also scrapped a new laptop launch this week because of its current position on a US trade blacklist. It is accused of having committed bank fraud to evade Iran sanctions, and obstruction of justice, among other violations. The firm denies any wrongdoing.","Huawei has delayed the launch of the Mate X folding handset until September, having originally planned to launch it this summer."
"By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor Others will point to the blog that uncovered sexism and sexual harassment at Uber, helping force the resignation of the ride-hailing firm's founder and paving the way for other controversies to be uncovered. Gamers may prefer instead to celebrate Nintendo's revival thanks to its Switch console, and motorists to highlight Elon Musk's desire to electrify the trucking industry. But you, BBC Tech's readers, focused your attention elsewhere - at least as far as our figures on what you clicked on suggest. Below are the stories you made most popular for each month of the year. January: Undesired dimension The quiet death of 3D TV was the first of the year's big stories. When Sony and LG unveiled their new television ranges at the CES Las Vegas tech expo, it soon became apparent none of the models supported the format. Samsung and Philips had already ditched the technology the previous year. Strictly speaking, 3D-on-the-home-screen wasn't totally extinct - Panasonic came out with a new set in February - but a combination of consumer apathy, frumpy glasses and uninterested streaming services had clearly doomed the extra dimension. With CES 2018 just around the corner, the question is whether we'll soon be able to call time on curved screens too. February: Nokia's retro relaunch HMD Global pulled off a marketing coup when it unveiled a new Nokia-branded 2G phone with the same name as one of the most iconic models of yesteryear. The ""reimagined"" 3310 featured the classic game Snake, offered extended battery life and kind of resembled the original design. But it lacked access to Snapchat, WhatsApp and countless other apps. Moreover, once owners got over the nostalgia factor, they discovered the photos it took were both pixelated and hard to get off the device. Even so, there was enough demand to justify a follow-up 3G model in September, and the phones appear to have helped raise the profile of other higher-end Nokia handsets. March: Watching the watchers Allegations that the CIA and MI5 had teamed up to hack Samsung TVs were made even juicier by the fact the project had apparently been given a Doctor Who-related codename. According to Wikileaks, the Weeping Angel attack caused compromised TVs to record audio when apparently switched off, before later uploading it to the cyberspies' computer servers. Effectively, it allowed a room to be bugged without producing giveaway radio signals. One theory for the project's name was that just like the malevolent sci-fi statues, the TVs were still ""alive"" even when they appeared to be inactive. Later in the year, Wikileaks published further details, including how the spyware could be uninstalled, as well as claims about other CIA-related hacking tools. April: Facebook and Google get scammed Although $100m (£76m) might seem like pocket change to Google and Facebook, the two companies missed the funds after they - and a third business, Quanta Computer - were allegedly conned by an email fraudster. The accused is said to have faked messages from an Asian-based manufacturer and convinced his victims to wire payments to his account over a three-year period. The Lithuanian suspect, Evaldas Rimasauskas, was extradited from his home country to New York later in the year where he now faces charges for wire fraud, money laundering and aggravated identity theft. He denies the allegations. May: WannaCry wreaks havoc A common refrain with cyber-security alerts is that, despite there being a hullabaloo of expert opinions, there's typically little real impact to the public. WannaCry was the exception. The ransomware attack swept across the world locking out users from tens of thousands of Windows PCs. The assault - later blamed on North Korea - forced NHS trusts in England and Scotland to cancel operations and other appointments. It was subsequently revealed that they had ignored earlier government warnings to update their systems, which could have mitigated the problem. The one upside was that a British cyber-security researcher, Marcus Hutchins, managed to trigger a ""kill switch"", halting the attack prematurely. More on him in a bit... June: Ukraine attack Just a month after WannaCry, another hack attack caused chaos - and this time the damage proved to be longer-lasting. An infected tax software update sent to businesses in Ukraine spread worldwide, disrupting the operations of some of the world's biggest companies. They included shipping firm Maersk, delivery giant FedEx, advertising conglomerate WPP and the consumer goods-maker Reckitt Benckiser. In some cases it took months before operations returned to normal, and related losses totalling more than $1bn were declared. Ukraine accused Russia of being responsible, but the Kremlin denied involvement. A complicating factor in reporting the cyber-strike was that the security industry struggled to settle on a name for it - with Petya, NotPetya, Pneytna, Petrwrap, SortaPetya and Goldeneye among the variants suggested. July: Bitcoin's big moment Bitcoin's future seemed in doubt when there were rival plans mid-year to tackle a slowdown in the amount of time taken to process transactions in the virtual currency. Without delving too deeply into the proposals - you can read up on Bip 91, Bitcoin Unlimited and Segwit2x if you dare - a compromise deal was eventually struck to make the underlying technology, the blockchain, more efficient. But the plan fell apart before it had a chance to be fully enacted in November. That failure didn't prevent Bitcoin's value from bubbling higher. When the article in question was published, it was worth about $2,400 per coin. By December, it was close to $20,000. Slow processing times, however, remain a headache. Earlier this month, the average time taken to confirm a Bitcoin transaction was close to 24 hours. August: From hero to hounded Marcus Hutchins never wanted to be exposed as the ""Wannacry hack hero"" and his name only became public after British newspapers revealed him to be cyber-security blogger Malware Tech against his will. That act carried a vicious sting in its tail when the 23 year old was arrested by the FBI after a trip to Las Vegas. The US accused him of having developed banking malware several years ago and of selling it on dark web forums - charges Mr Hutchins denies. The accusations caused fury among other cyber-security professionals, with some vowing to restrict the support they offered the authorities. Mr Hutchins is currently released on bail in Los Angeles where he is awaiting trial. In the meantime, the Trump administration recently acknowledged that it was ""lucky"" Mr Hutchins had thwarted Wannacry, although it avoided mentioning him by name. September: iPhone X exposed Curiously, a major leak about Apple's iPhone X ahead of its official launch managed to attract more eyeballs to BBC Tech than the actual unveiling of the device itself. Details included the phone's name, the set-up process for its facial recognition technology and the inclusion of its animated emoji characters. An extra element of schadenfreude was provided for company critics by the fact that an earlier leak had disclosed that Apple had hired ex-FBI and NSA workers to thwart such spoilers. It's questionable whether the reveal actually dampened demand for the £1,000 handset. The US firm has forecast record sales for its current quarter. However, in recent days some analysts have begun to question how robust demand will be later in 2018. October: Amazon thieves busted When a company gets to be Amazon's size it has to rely on automated systems to deal with items reported as damaged or missing by their intended recipients. A US couple thought that presented them with an opportunity. They used hundreds of fake identities to order gadgets from the online retailer, reported problems that triggered replacement deliveries, and then sold on all the goods for a profit. The $1.2m scale of their crime, however, meant their activity had in fact been detected and they eventually pleaded guilty to mail fraud and money laundering after being arrested. Erin Joseph Finan and his wife Leah Jeannette Finan were supposed to have been sentenced in November. But that has been delayed after they were accused of defrauding another internet retailer in the months after the original charges were filed. November: Rough start ""The future is here,"" Navya's self-driving shuttle bus had emblazoned on its side as it launched its Las Vegas pick-up service. Unfortunately, less than an hour later, that future involved a delivery lorry backing into its front. As one passenger later recounted, the ""crash"" seemed to occur in slow-motion and only caused superficial damage. But the story sped across the world. Although the human driver was ultimately held responsible, the police report - made public earlier this month - told a more nuanced story. The trucker said they had turned on their hazard lights and sounded a back-up alarm to warn surrounding motorists that they were straightening up the cab. It had never occurred to them that an automated vehicle would respond by remaining stationary in their path without doing more to prevent the accident. December: Slowing down Apple may have had the best of intentions, but its love of secrecy left even some of its biggest fans shaking their heads this time round. It was only after a blog by the makers of the Geekbench app went viral that the US firm publicly confirmed it had been deliberately slowing down ageing iPhones to help manage performance issues caused by their batteries wearing out. It subsequently emerged that the firm had apparently privately briefed some analysts on the decision a year ago, but had not shared the details with its consumers. Whether those customers would really have preferred thicker handsets with bigger or swappable batteries is open to debate. But the risk it faces is that shoppers suspect it is untrustworthy. At time of writing, Apple is being sued in eight separate cases in the US over the matter, as well as facing legal action in Israel.","For many, 2017 will be defined by fake news and the fight-back against it."
"The arrest took place earlier this month but has only just been announced for ""tactical reasons"". Now a court will have to decide if the alleged hacker can be extradited to the US. More than 100 million LinkedIn logins were advertised for sale earlier this year. According to the Reuters news agency, the man was arrested without resistance in a restaurant of a hotel in central Prague. Initially the hack was thought to have affected only a small number of users, and the business-focused social network reset the accounts of those thought to have been compromised. Following the exposure of IDs on the web, LinkedIn moved to repeat this on a much larger scale. The company said: ""Following the 2012 breach of LinkedIn member information, we have remained actively involved with the FBI's case to pursue those responsible. ""We are thankful for the hard work and dedication of the FBI in its efforts to locate and capture the parties believed to be responsible for this criminal activity.""

"A computer error caused the US Geological Survey (USGS) to issue the false alarm about the magnitude 6.8 quake. The quake actually took place in 1925 when it laid waste to the city of Santa Barbara and caused 13 deaths. In a statement, the USGS said its computers had ""misinterpreted"" data causing the alarm to be wrongly issued. Substantial collapse News organisations across the US received the emailed alert about the quake which, if it had been real, would have been one of the largest ever recorded in California. Few organisations reacted directly to the news because it was dated 29 June 2025 - exactly 100 years after the actual event took place. The LA Times, which uses AI-based software to automatically write up the USGS alerts, did issue a news story based on the alarm notice. The federal body said work it was doing to revise and update information about where the historic quake struck had caused computer systems to misinterpret the data and think it was seeing a novel event. It apologised for causing any alarm and said it was ""working to resolve the issue"". The 1925 quake is classed as a level seven-to-nine event on the intensity scale used by the USGS to measure the damage done by earthquakes. At the higher end of this range, the quakes would cause ""considerable"" damage even to structures designed to withstand tremors, bring about a partial collapse of substantial buildings and make many buildings shift on their foundations.",A warning about a massive earthquake off the coast of California has been sent 92 years late.
"By Mark WardTechnology correspondent, BBC News Strict rationing of these addresses - called IPv4 - has been started by the body that hands them out in Europe. From now on, companies can only make one more application for IPv4 addresses and, if successful, will only get 1,024 of them. In addition, any application for more old addresses must demonstrate how an organisation is using the new, replacement, addressing scheme. ""The day has come, finally,"" said Axel Pawlik, managing director of the Ripe NCC that hands out addresses to European ISPs, firms and other organisations. Every device that goes online is allocated a unique Internet Protocol (IP) address. The internet grew up using an addressing scheme called IP Version 4 (IPv4). In the 1970s when the web was being built the 4.3 billion IP addresses allowed by IPv4 were thought to be enough. However, the rapid growth of the internet and popularity of the web have swiftly exhausted this pool. The growth of the net is linked to the size of the pool because everything that connects to the net needs an IP address to send and receive data. Restrictions Plans are afoot to move to a new scheme, known as IP Version 6 (IPv6), that has an effectively inexhaustible supply of addresses. On 14 September Ripe NCC got down to its last 16 million IPv4 addresses. While this might sound a lot, said Mr Pawlik, the use of this last substantial block would be so heavily restricted that the supply could be considered to be at an end. ""Applicants will only get about 1,000 addresses,"" said Mr Pawlik, ""and that's it and they only get them once and that's the end of it."" To even get that small number of IPv4 addresses, he said, applicants must already have an allocation of IPv6 addresses and demonstrate how they planned to use them. Immediately prior to reaching the last big block Ripe was handing out just under four million IPv4 addresses every 10 days. Anyone planning expansion based around the net should already be committed to using IPv6, said Mr Pawlik. Other techniques based around technical tricks that share IPv4 addresses among many different devices would prove increasingly unworkable, he said. ""They are complicated, potentially unstable and expensive,"" he said. ""The other route they could go is to v6 as it's in most of the net equipment now.""",Europe has almost exhausted its stock of old-style internet addresses.

"By Zoe KleinmanTechnology reporter, BBC News According to the video, the drone could fly for up to 15 miles (24km) and deliver a parcel within 30 minutes of the order being placed. There was no indication of when it might be used by the retail giant. The firm was given permission to test delivery drones in the US earlier this year. It also has drone delivery development centres in the UK and Israel. The prototype will be part of a ""family"" of delivery aircraft, Mr Clarkson added in the clip, and is one of around a dozen devices the firm is developing. The drone is equipped with ""sense and avoid technology"" and can fly at a height of 400 feet. Security Tech lawyer Luke Scanlon from Pinsent Masons law firm said security could be an issue if this technology is software-based. ""'Detect and avoid' systems rely on software and given the current climate of hacking and data breaches, it is very important that co-ordinated efforts are made to ensure that systems are put in place which are given the highest level of assurance in terms of security,"" he said.

Amazon said it would not launch the service until it was able to ""demonstrate safe operations"". The US Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) has strict criteria for commercial drone use and some American politicians have called for the setting up of a drone register.

"By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor Security firm Avast said that one of the apps involved - a free version of the card game Durak - had been downloaded up to 10 million times, according to Google Play's own counter. Google has now blocked access. But one expert noted that the problem might be less widespread than feared. Avast said that it first became aware of the issue after a member of the public contacted it after carrying out his own investigation into how his Nexus 5 smartphone had come to be infected with malicious code. The ""adware"" was causing spurious pop-up messages to appear that had been made to look like system notifications. These told him his phone was running ""slow"" and that he needed to install new software to fix the problem. If he followed the on-screen prompts he was then directed to download other apps, only some of which were legitimate. ""You get re-directed to harmful threats on fake pages, like dubious app stores and apps that attempt to send premium SMS behind your back or to apps that simply collect too much of your data for comfort while offering you no additional value,"" wrote Avast's malware analyst Filip Chytry. The original apps were said to have held off showing the pop-ups until seven or more days after being installed, which the analyst suggested was intended to mask the fact that they were responsible. ""Most people won't be able to find the source of the problem and will face fake ads each time they unlock their device,"" he wrote. ""I believe that most people will trust that there is a problem that can be solved with one of the app's advertised 'solutions' and will follow the recommended steps, which may lead to an investment into unwanted apps from untrusted sources."" In addition to the Durak card game, other apps alleged to be involved include: A search by the BBC for other apps made by the same developers revealed dozens more apps, including video games, a psychology guide, wedding planning software and cookery tips - all of which have now been blocked. The publishers involved have not replied to requests for comment. A spokesman for Google said: ""We're just confirming that all of the apps in the report have been suspended and nothing more."" Inflated numbers Although Google Play's own site indicated the software had been downloaded many millions of times, one security researcher was cautious about the figures. ""I would take the numbers with a pinch of salt because one thing that malware authors might do is deliberately up the amount of downloads in order to make an app appear more popular than it really is,"" said Dr Steven Murdoch from University College London's information security research group. ""Google does scan for malware that it knows about and it also has some more advanced techniques to detect malicious behaviour. ""But these don't work 100% of the time and some apps do slip through the checks - and there is a continual cat and mouse game of people looking for malware and the authors trying to bypass the checks."" Although Avast is using the publicity it has generated to promote its own security software, Dr Murdoch noted that it too would fail to identify all new types of malware. One alternative, he said, was to check reviews. Several people who had downloaded the Durak card game had posted warnings on Google Play as far back as November 2013, that they suspected it was forcing pop-up ads to appear. ""But that's still not going to catch everything,"" Dr Murdoch added. ""Phone users ultimately have to trust the operating system vendor - whether that's Google or Apple [or someone else] to protect them.""",Android users are being warned that several popular apps that were on the official Google Play store appear to have contained hidden code that made malicious ads pop up.
"Currently most ISPs advertise services as 'up to' a certain speed - for instance, 20Mbps (megabits per second). But Ofcom's latest research finds that very few consumers actually get these headline speeds. ""There is a substantial gap between advertised speeds and the actual speeds people get in their homes,"" Ofcom chief executive Ed Richards told the BBC. ""The chances of someone receiving the advertised headline speed are fairly remote,"" he said. ""We would like to see clearer information provided to consumers which more accurately reflects the likely speeds they will actually receive,"" he added. Ofcom's latest research into broadband speeds found that just 14% of customers on 'up to' 20Mbps services received speeds of over 12Mbps, while 58% averaged speeds of 6Mbps or less. Consumer confusion Cable and fibre services fared better, with 92% of Virgin Media customers on an 'up to' 50Mbps service averaging 45.6Mbps. Its lower 10Mbps service saw average speeds of 9.6Mbps. BT's Fibre-to-the-Cabinet technology, which is currently available to 15% of UK homes, has an average of 31.8Mbps on the 40Mbps service. Unrealistic broadband speeds has long been an issue for consumer groups, who say such advertising is adding to consumer confusion over net services. ""Broadband speeds are a major source of dissatisfaction for UK broadband customers,"" says Michael Phillips, product director at comparison site Broadbandchoices. ""We have been pushing for 'typical speeds' to be made the gold standard for speed measurement since 2007 - in the same way that banks use 'typical' APR percentages."" The Advertising Standards Authority is looking into the issue. Ofcom is recommending that ISPs use Typical Speed Rates (TSR) to avoid confusing consumers. It has set guidelines for these speeds. It recommends that ADSL services currently advertised as 'up to' 20Mbps (megabits per second) be changed to a TSR of between 3 and 9Mbps. BT is not impressed with Ofcom's idea. ""We have real concerns with their approach. Broadband speeds vary from line to line and so it is meaningless to use one speed for advertising. That is why we use the term 'up to',"" said John Petter, managing director of BT Retail. He said he thought such a policy ""would encourage digital exclusion rather than tackle it"". ""Enforcing typical speed ranges is also dangerous as it could encourage more ISPs to cherry pick customers who will increase their average, leaving customers in rural and suburban areas under-served,"" he said. PlusNet defended its current advertising. ""We offer customers a personalised speed range. ""This is confirmed at application and then again once a customer has had their broadband service fully installed - we are completely honest with customers about the speeds they will receive,"" said chief executive Jamie Ford. Virgin Media, which fared the best in the speed tests, welcomed the news: ""Ofcom's latest report is yet another damning indictment that consumers continue to be treated like mugs and misled by ISPs that simply cannot deliver on their advertised speed claims,"" said Jon James, executive director of broadband at Virgin Media. Andrew Ferguson, editor of broadband website ThinkBroadband, said using average speeds could encourage mediocrity. ""Providers who now go all out to get the best speeds could give up and make do with the average,"" he said. He added that there was ""no such thing as an average"" because the speed of a connection depends on so many factors, including home wiring, the applications being used and where in the UK people live.",Ofcom is seeking to stop internet service providers from advertising unrealistic broadband speeds.
"The mandatory requirement to register covers owners of drones or model aircraft weighing more than 250g (8.8oz). Owners of unregistered drones could then face the threat of a fine. At the same time, the CAA is starting a service it hopes will reunite owners with their lost drones. A quarter of owners have lost a drone at some point, CAA research suggests. Most lost drones go missing because of malfunctions in flight, the research indicates. This includes losing battery power, loss of signal or technology failures. But a quarter of cases involve pilots making mistakes. CAA spokesman Jonathan Nicholson said: ""Our aim is for the Drones Reunited platform to become an essential service for the drone community - the first port of call for anyone who has lost, or found, a drone."" The CAA said anyone who registered their drone would get free access to the service, which issues each device with a unique identification code. Online test Pilots who lose a drone will be able to record the loss via the CAA's drones-reunited site. Anyone who finds a downed drone bearing an ID number will be able to look it up on the site and inform its owner it has been located. Registering craft weighing between 250g and 20kg costs £9 a year. Registered drone owners, who must be over 18, will need to pass an online test that quizzes them on using their device safely. Anyone who wants to fly a drone, including children, will also have to pass the test, which can be taken as many times as required. Not all owners must register by 30 November.

"Paris Hilton, boxer Floyd Mayweather and others have all publicly backed digital currency funding drives. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said the endorsements could break laws on selling securities. Those promoting crypto-currencies must say if they are being paid for the endorsement, it said. Cash caution In its official warning, the SEC pointed to the growing numbers of public figures who have talked about the funding drives, known as Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), that crypto-currencies run to raise cash. About 270 separate crypto-cash start-ups have sought funds via ICOs in 2017, said the New York Times. In total, the ICOs have raised more than $3bn (£2.27bn), it said. The SEC said any virtual coins or tokens bought by investors through an ICO were subject to the same laws governing the sale of stocks and shares sold via mainstream stock markets. These laws require anyone backing a security to disclose their relationship with the company offering the investment opportunity. ""A failure to disclose this information is a violation of the anti-touting provisions of the federal securities laws,"" it said, adding that keeping quiet about any financial arrangement could be considered fraudulent. It said it was keeping an eye on people who promote the crypto-currencies to ensure laws were not broken. In a separate but related bulletin, the SEC cautioned against following the investment advice of any public figure. ""It is never a good idea to make an investment decision just because someone famous says a product or service is a good investment,"" it said. It encouraged investors to do their own research into potential money-making schemes and not rely on paid endorsements, it said. Regulators in Switzerland, Britain and Malaysia have also issued warnings about the risks associated with ICOs.

"By Mark WardTechnology correspondent, BBC News The Child Abuse Image Database (CAID) will help UK police forces co-ordinate investigations into abuse. Huge growth in the number of abuse images circulating online means forces need help analysing what they seize. The database is part of a massive international effort to classify images and track down victims. The need for CAID has arisen because such action against abusers and websites often leaves police forces needing to categorise hundreds of thousands and sometimes millions of images. Many of these images will have been seen before as the trade in abuse content has led to them being duplicated many times. This can make it difficult for investigators to pick out novel images that could lead them to victims that have not been seen before. Project Vic In a statement, policing minister Mike Penning said CAID was ""a watershed moment in this government's drive to stamp out the despicable crime of online child sexual exploitation"". ""The outcomes will be life-changing, and in some cases life-saving,"" he said. ""That is how important this database is."" The CAID database is also part of a larger international effort called Project Vic that seeks to classify images held by forces around the world. Richard Brown from the International Centre for Missing and Exploited Children, which is helping co-ordinate Project Vic, said the two initiatives were using the same protocols to ensure images could be swapped back and forth easily. Seven other countries were already helping with Project Vic and more were expected to sign up soon, he said. ""It is groundbreaking for law enforcement, tool providers, non-profits and industry to all stand together and agree on the need to standardize the approach to such egregious crimes,"" Mr Brown told the BBC.

"There were no injuries in the incident in which the drone hit the wheel and then a table as it fell to the ground. The incident has added weight to calls to introduce national registers for the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). The US has started up a register while the Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) has just announced similar plans for UAVs weighing over 1kg. The area on Seattle's Pier 57 is understood to be a no-fly zone. Drone crashes Drone or unmanned aerial vehicle (UAVs) usage is skyrocketing with the Federal Aviation Administration estimating that by 2020 in the US there will be approximately 30,000 commercial drones in use and many more civilian devices. Last month the US Department of Transportation and the FAA announced that they were preparing a registration scheme that would allow them to ""track down people who fly drones above the FAA designated-altitudes, or get too close to airports and other restricted zones"". In Ireland, from 21 December, all drones weighing over 1kg must be registered while in the UK the House of Lords EU Committee have called for the compulsory registration of all commercial and civilian drones. Drone crashes are increasingly hitting the headlines: Drone use has raised privacy and security questions too. When a quadcopter drone crashed into the White House lawn in January, it caused minor panic until it emerged that the operator was a government employee. As the number of drone-related accidents increases, so drone liability has emerged as a field of law and drone injury lawyers are setting up websites to help people who have been ""injured by drone"".",Seattle police are investigating after a drone collided with the city's giant Ferris wheel on Wednesday afternoon.
"Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent@BBCRoryCJon Twitter His exit, just weeks after the launch of Windows 8, raises questions about the future direction of the business, not least because he was seen as a credible successor to Ballmer. A 23 year veteran of the company, he was a familiar figure to anyone who attended a Microsoft launch, a polished performer explaining just why we should be excited about the latest innovations in the Windows operating system. The Windows 8 launch has been seen by the company as a great success, moving Microsoft into the new touchscreen mobile era, with Steve Ballmer celebrating the sales of four million copies in just three days. True, there have been some complaints from those who see the new operating system as an uneasy mix of the new mobile world and the old desktop environment, but Microsoft seems confident that all is going to plan. So why has the man who has been central to the launch gone? Microsoft's statement revealing the news has done nothing to dampen the rumours of a bust-up at the top. Although it features a quote from Steve Ballmer expressing gratitude for Sinofsky's years of work and another from the man himself talking of the professionalism and generosity of everyone at ""this awesome company"", there is no explanation of why he is leaving. That quote from the Windows president is also in an email he has written to Microsoft staff in which he says he is leaving to pursue new opportunities. He says that this is an ideal moment for him to move on, having launched Windows 8, and is keen to dispel any conspiracy theories: ""This was a personal and private choice that in no way reflects any speculation or theories one might read - about me, opportunity, the company or its leadership."" So if it is as simple as that he wants to go off and do something else, why did Microsoft not make that clear in its press release? I put that to the company and got no real response. Then I looked at a CNET profile of Steven Sinofsky. The article, which appears well sourced, talks of a brilliant but divisive figure, feuding with fellow executives and creating ""a toxic work environment that has chased talented employees away from a maturing company that's in desperate need of innovative thinking."" So perhaps Steve Ballmer was rather relieved when Mr Sinofsky talked of seeking out new opportunities. In any case, it is inevitable that there will be speculation because Mr Sinofsky's departure comes at a time of upheaval in some other big technology firms. The most obvious example is Apple, which last month got rid of Scott Forstall, boss of its iOS software division, and John Browett, who very briefly ran the retail operation. Both were apparently axed because of serious failings - notably in Forstall's case the disastrous Apple Maps launch which resulted in the millions who upgraded to iOS 6 getting a much worse product than they'd had before. What all of these giant companies are trying to do is foster a continued spirit of innovation and risk-taking in a fast-moving environment where any mistake can leave a business floundering to catch up. When I interviewed Steve Ballmer last month, my repeated suggestions that Microsoft had struggled to innovate in recent years were met with some impatience. But it seems likely that he decided that the completion of Windows 8 was a good time to review how the company was working. Now another company veteran, Julie Larson-Green, has been given the task of heading up Microsoft's most important division, running all of Windows software and hardware engineering. In my experience, Microsoft still employs some of the brightest and most capable people in the technology industry. But combining their efforts to produce a fast moving business turning out innovative products remains a challenge.",The technology world is abuzz today with news of the abrupt departure of a key executive at Microsoft . Steve Sinofsky is probably the second most important figure at the company after the chief executive Steve Ballmer. Now he is leaving with immediate effect.
"By Mark WardTechnology correspondent, BBC News As well as using social media to rally supporters and spread propaganda, some factions are employing hackers to gather intelligence. Well-known attack programs have been re-purposed in a bid to to subvert routers and other systems inside Iraq. More broadly, cyber-thieves are also using the conflict to help trick people into opening booby-trapped messages. Local conflict ""The key parties are local groups within Iraq using malware for targeted intelligence on each other,"" said Andrew Komarov, chief executive of security firm Intel Crawler. ""It is very hard to confirm who is the author, as some of the malware is used from public sources,"" said Mr Komarov, ""but it is very visible that it is used within Iraq, and not outside against foreign countries, which may explain the beginning of internal local cyber-war."" One malware program, called Njrat, was used in hundreds of incidents and had helped some groups create networks of machines they could control remotely. Once machines were infected with Njrat, attackers immediately started stealing files or using a computer's camera or microphone to monitor what was going on around it. These attacks differ from those seen when malware similar to Njrat is used in other countries, said Mr Komarov. Instead of simply spamming out messages seeking victims from whom attackers can steal money, the cyber-activists in Iraq seem to target particular cities, groups and even families. ""All the attacks are very selective and affected mostly local conflicting parties,"" said Mr Komarov. In addition, he said, Intel Crawler had seen some civilians targeted but these might be relatives and friends of people more closely involved in the conflict in the region. Attackers attempt to infect potential victims using social media, said Mr Komarov but they are also scanning the net within Iraq seeking routers that they can then subvert using their own tools. The majority of these attacks are concentrated on four Iraqi cities, Baghdad, Basra, Mosul and Erbil. ""The reasons for doing this are intelligence gathering against local protest, opposition parties, as well as their contacts in civil population, or government and vice versa,"" he said. Intel Crawler gathered its information by monitoring activity on Iraqi cyberspace and via intelligence contacts in the region. Cyber-security firm Kaspersky Labs said the conflicts in Iraq, Syria and other Middle Eastern nations had spawned a whole series of attacks that were hitting people across the region. Senior security researcher Mohamad Amin Hasbini said many of the attacks had been ""heated"" by the continuing conflict, but it was not clear whether they were all politically motivated. However, he said, there was evidence that attackers were exploiting interest in the conflict to trick people into opening booby-trapped attachments or visiting pages that exploit vulnerabilities in browsers. Topics such as Shia Muslims, connections between Syrian President Assad and Isis, arrests of Isis militants, names of Hezbollah infiltrators and information about trouble spots in the region had all been used in files seeded with malware, said Mr Hasbini. ""Malware used in those attacks appears to have been distributed with the help of social media channels including Facebook, YouTube, political forums and via e-mail, Skype and Whatsapp messengers,"" he added. Njrat as well as other malicious programs called Bitfrost and DarkComet had all been used to create these dangerous messages, he said. ""After successful infection, the hackers are capable of monitoring the device and can take full control, including key-logging, taking screenshots and activating the camera,"" he added.","A cyber-civil war is being waged alongside the armed conflict in Iraq, research by security firms suggests."
"Darpa says it wants "" adaptable robots with the ability to use human tools - from hand tools to vehicles"". It plans to hold a series of emergency response physical challenges. A $2m (£1.3m) prize is being offered to the team with the best technology. The competition begins in October. The agency says it hopes software engineers, video game developers and other experts from fields outside robotics will take part ""to increase the diversity of innovative solutions"". Radiation-resistant Robots have already been deployed into danger zones. After the Fukushima nuclear plant meltdown in 2011, Japanese authorities used unmanned vehicles and ""first responder"" robots developed by the British firm Qintetiq to move heavy debris and measure radiation levels. The US Army has also used robots in Iraq and Afghanistan to clear buildings and check for explosive devices. However, Darpa says more work needs to be done to make the machines interact with humans more naturally. ""This challenge is going to test supervised autonomy in perception and decision-making, mounted and dismounted mobility, dexterity, strength and endurance in an environment designed for human use but degraded due to disaster,"" said Gill Pratt, Darpa's programme manager. ""Adaptability is also essential because we don't know where the next disaster will strike."" Autonomous automatons Jeremy Wyatt, reader in robotics at the University of Birmingham, suggested that efforts should focus on making the machines less dependent on human operators. ""Robots operated by humans have been used since the World Trade Center disaster, but no completely autonomous robots have been deployed in a real disaster to date,"" he said. ""Robot autonomy is improving steadily, but often it is easier and more reliable to have a human operate the robot remotely. Also autonomy raises safety and reliability concerns. ""Having said that I would expect to see limited autonomy used in robots for mapping and surveillance at disasters at some point in the next decade."" War robots Darpa's last grand challenge - a driverless car race across 150 miles (241km)of desert - spurred on major developments in the field, said Noel Sharkey, professor of artificial intelligence and robotics at The University of Sheffield. However, he expressed concerns about the latest contest. ""I am sure that some good spin-offs will come from it,"" he told the BBC. ""But when we look at the tasks more closely and the fact that Darpa is funding the challenge, we need to be realistic about the true intentions. ""This is part of the US war machine with the aim of developing robots for the battlefield. While there may be very good civil applications, these machines are clearly moving us toward the automation and industrialisation of warfare.""",A competition to develop next-generation robots capable of saving lives in disaster zones has been unveiled by the Pentagon's advanced research laboratory.
"Dave LeeNorth America technology reporter His departure concludes a turbulent two year period that started when Google bought Nest for $3.2bn (£2bn). There had been reports of complaints from staff about the management of the business, and criticism of its slow roll-out of new products. But in a lengthy blog post published on Friday, Mr Fadell said the move had planned for some time. ""This transition has been in progress since late last year and while I won't be present day to day at Nest, I'll remain involved in my new capacity as an advisor to Alphabet and [its chief executive] Larry Page. ""This will give me the time and flexibility to pursue new opportunities to create and disrupt other industries."" Mr Fadell is being replaced by Marwan Fawaz. He used to run Motorola's Home division, and is expected to bring his expertise in connected devices to Nest as it attempts to build on the early success of the Nest thermostat. 'Catapulted' Mr Fadell was praised on Friday by Mr Page. ""Under Tony's leadership, Nest has catapulted the connected home into the mainstream, secured leadership positions for each of its products, and grown its revenue in excess of 50% year over year since they began shipping products,"" he wrote. ""He's a true visionary and I look forward to continuing to work with him in his new role as advisor to Alphabet."" The kind words between Mr Fadell and his superiors and successor will not distract from the dramatic, often public events over the past year. From the product side, sales of Nest's smoke and carbon monoxide alarm Protect were halted when the company discovered the alarm could be accidentally disabled if someone waved their arms underneath it. Customers were offered a full refund. A bug in Nest's smart thermostat left some users with ""cold house, cold feet"" earlier this year, while its smart hub, Revolv, was intentionally bricked by the company. Nest's acquisition of Dropcam - a security camera maker - exposed further fractures. Dropcam's founder Greg Duffy, who left when Google bought the company, wrote an astonishingly blunt Medium post attacking the management of Mr Fadell. ""The 50 Dropcam employees who resigned did so because they felt their ability to build great products being totally crushed,"" Mr Duffy wrote. In an apparent reference to Apple's founder, the late Steve Jobs, Mr Duffy added: ""The current leadership of Nest... seems to be fetishising only the most superfluous and negative traits of their mentors."" There was no official statement at the time from Nest nor Google/Alphabet. But in an interview conducted before Mr Duffy's Medium post was published, Mr Fadell said: ""A lot of [Dropcam's] employees were not as good as we hoped. It was a very small team and unfortunately it wasn't a very experienced team."" Connected home If there's a bigger picture to take from all of this, it's perhaps this: despite a chorus of voices backing the concept, the vision of the connected home does not seem to be materialising. If you could travel back in time to the Consumer Electronic Show (CES) in, say, 2014, and tell attendees that midway through 2016 there still wouldn't be a critical mass of people with app-enabled houses, you'd be a lonely voice indeed. In an interview with Bloomberg, Mr Fadell defended his tenure of Nest with a fair assessment that when you're treading new ground, errors will be made along the way. ""I don't know of any regrets that I have,"" he told the financial news organisation. ""You can take something as a challenge or take it as a learning experience. And so for me, it's always growth. We all make mistakes. We have to make mistakes when we learn to speak or we learn to walk or crawl. ""So, to do what we do at the level we do it, no one's done it before.

"It said Samsung, Dell and Lenovo would sell PCs powered by the software, adding to previous announcements about Asus and Microsoft itself. Windows RT is designed to work on chips based on British firm ARM's designs. It is the first version of Microsoft's flagship system made for consumer devices not powered by the x86 chip architectures used by Intel and AMD. Windows RT devices will become available on 26 October alongside the release of other Windows 8 products. But unlike the other versions of the system it will not be offered as a stand-alone purchase, and can only be obtained by buying one of the computers it is installed upon. Publicising partnerships Microsoft's announcement in June that it would offer its own Windows RT tablet - Surface - had led to speculation that the firm's relationship with other manufacturers could become strained. The company acknowledged the risk in a filing with US regulators saying: ""Our Surface devices will compete with products made by our OEM [original equipment manufacturer] partners, which may affect their commitment to our platform."" But in a blog post announcing the names of the device makers Microsoft was keen to stress the importance of its partnerships. ""Our engineering collaboration on these Windows RT PCs has been strong, collaborating with the PC manufacturers, silicon partners, and operators to focus on hardware, software and services integration,"" wrote Windows chief Steven Sinofsky. ""Product designs were informed and revised by our collective efforts through development and testing."" Acer has said it intended to release Windows RT devices next year. But Toshiba said it wanted to ""monitor market conditions"" before making a decision, while Hewlett Packard said it wanted to focus on x86-based alternatives for the time being. Gaming controversy Windows RT devices will offer full access to the system's touchscreen interface - previously known as Metro - but will not run third-party apps when switched to desktop mode. They are likely to be marketed as offering extended battery life and the ability to turn on in less than a second from standby mode. Microsoft has also signalled that its own Windows RT tablets would be cheaper and thinner than its Intel-based ones. However, the company's decision to limit Windows RT devices to installing software from its store - which is not the case for other Windows 8 computers - has attracted criticism. The move replicates a similar restriction imposed by Apple on its ARM-based iPads, but has still been attacked by video games developers who are unhappy that Microsoft will take a 30% cut of sales. Gabe Newell, chief executive of Valve, which makes the Half Life and Portal series, branded it a ""catastrophe"". An executive from Blizzard, the firm behind World of Warcraft, said the move was ""not awesome"", while indie developer Stardock's founder has said Microsoft was pursuing a ""wrongheaded approach"".",Microsoft has revealed five manufacturers will offer Windows RT PCs after the operating system launches.
"By Leo KelionTechnology reporter The firm says the chips offer improved battery life and a leap in graphics power over the previous generation. Intel is the leading PC chip-maker and its product refreshes typically spur on new laptop and desktop sales. Computers using the chips have already been unveiled at the Computex tech show. However, studies suggest the market is in decline because of competition from smartphones and tablets. Most smart devices are powered by chips based on designs by the British firm ARM rather than the x86 architecture used by Intel. Even so, Intel said Haswell would allow laptops and two-in-one devices - offering both a laptop and tablet experience - to become thinner and last longer between charges, increasing their appeal. It added that one version of the new chips featured CPU (central processing unit) cores which used just six watts of scenario design power - its power usage during ""regular"" tasks. Intel said this was low enough for Haswell to be used in ""cooler, quieter, fanless designs"". The amount of heat given off by the previous generation, Ivy Bridge, had meant that two fans needed to be included in the design of Microsoft's Surface Pro tablet. Haswell tocks Haswell - or the fourth generation Intel Core processors, as the family is formally known - marks the ""tock"" in the US firm's regular ""tick-tock"" development cycle. This refers to the fact that its improvements centre around a new chip architecture rather than a change to its transistors. The firm says the new design of the family's CPU cores is capable of delivering a 15% boost in performance, a 50% improvement in active-use battery life, and up to three times the amount of standby battery life when compared to the performance of Ivy Bridge. In addition, it says versions of the chip which include its new integrated GPU (graphics processing unit) - which it calls Iris - offer twice the performance when handling complex tasks such as generating 3D graphics or encoding high definition video. For some users, that will mean they do not need a separate graphics card - something that adds to the bulk and cost of a computer. It could also help drive the roll-out of laptops with higher resolution screens. These make more demands on a chip's GPU because more pixels are involved. Some reviews of Apple's 13in Macbook Pro with Retina Display - which relies on Ivy Bridge's less powerful integrated GPU to drive its 226 pixels per inch (ppi) screen - suggested that the laptop struggled to cope in some situations. However, Nvidia - a GPU card maker - has already warned Haswell has limits of its own. ""Any serious gamer will tell you that integrated graphics is far from adequate for delivering a reasonable, let alone good experience,"" it said. ""Haswell won't change that."" Longer lasting Intel boasts that the improvement in battery life is the biggest such gain in its history. The company says it was able to do this because Haswell is more aggressive at cutting voltages to the parts of its architecture that do not need it. ""If someone is typing on their PC, we can literally shut everything down when it's not being used and then immediately bring it back up again in between the keystrokes,"" Navin Shenoy, vice president of the Intel Architecture Group, told the BBC. ""The system is smart enough to know it's not being used for those nanoseconds. That's the kind of granular power management at the chip level that we've never had before."" Intel has achieved this by integrating a voltage regulator into its chip's architecture for the first time. In the past as many as seven additional third-party chips were needed to take care of this task. An added benefit is that space is saved inside the computer. Mr Shenoy added that his firm had also worked with companies who make other components used in PCs to ensure they are optimised to complement Haswell's power regulation abilities. ARM's challenge Intel says Haswell marks a ""radical change"" to its processor line-up, but it also highlights the continuation of a long-running business strategy. ""Intel has always held onto the value of its chips by integrating more components,"" said Sergis Mushell, a computer chip expert at the tech consultancy Gartner. ""It takes parts that were previously discrete - such as the need for a separate GPU - and builds them in. It's the only way the firm can protect its margins."" But another analyst warned that Intel might struggle to repeat past profits. ""Intel and the other x86-chip maker AMD both have a huge problem: they are trying to sell processors for computers into a market where people have increasingly lost interest,"" said Chris Green, principal technology analyst at Davies Murphy Group Europe. ""People don't want PCs in the same volumes they did, and are increasingly going for ARM-based smart devices instead. ""Windows 8 has also failed to deliver the traditional uplift in PC sales which you'd expect from a new version of Microsoft's system making it even harder for Intel to ship large quantities of its processors to PC-makers - and Apple Macs and Linux PCs have not been able to mop up the slack."" However, Mr Mushell was more optimistic noting that the Haswell line-up would soon be joined by a cheaper range of Intel chips - codenamed Bay Trail - which he said had a good chance of appearing in Android devices.",Intel has formally launched its Haswell family of processors.
"It is expanding existing uses of the smart ID system and is looking into ways it can replace passport checks. Reuters reports however, that proposals to use cameras mounted on lamp posts that scan faces to ID passengers has raised privacy concerns. Airport officials have dismissed ""big brother"" worries. Last call One potentially welcome use of facial recognition could be to spot passengers who have missed the last boarding call for their flight. ""We have lots of reports of lost passengers, so one possible use we can think of is, we need to detect and find people who are on the flight. Of course, with permission from the airlines,"" Steve Lee, Changi Airport Group's chief information officer, told Reuters. Mr Lee says that the airport is working with a number of companies and plans to have facial recognition in place in a year's time. The newest terminal at Changi, T4, is already using facial recognition for self-service check-in options as well as bag drop, immigration and boarding. This means there are fewer queues as well as fewer visible airport or security staff. When passengers drop luggage at unstaffed booths, a photo of their face is taken and then matched against the picture in their passport. At automated security gates in immigration, another snap is taken and is used to verify a passenger's identity at the boarding gate. Changi airport is looking at how it can implement the facial recognition technology in its three other terminals at bag drop and immigration as well as potentially in terminal five which is expected to be up and running in the next 10 years. Mr Lee said: ""Today you take passport, you show your face and you show your boarding pass. ""Then actually in future, you just take your face. You don't need your passport,"" Missing Persons Facial recognition technology is also being used in Australia in a new campaign to identify missing persons. The Missing Persons Action Network (MPAN) has launched an Invisible Friends campaign encouraging Facebook users to add profiles of missing people as friends so that, once they're tagged in an image MPAN can be notified. New GDPR regulations coming into effect later this month mean that Facebook must seek permissions to build 3D profiles of people using the social networking site in Europe. However as MPAN is in Australia these rules will not apply. ""The growth of real time facial recognition in public places is alarming,"" said Silkie Carlo, director of digital rights activists Big Brother Watch. She added: ""It could be the final nail in the coffin for individual privacy and the right to be anonymous in public. ""Even if some uses are socially well-intended, it is a technology that lends itself to authoritarianism as we have already seen in the UK where it has been used to monitor protests and collect biometric photos of innocent people. ""It is highly questionable whether authorities' use of automated facial recognition in public is lawful in the context of international and regional rights frameworks.""",Singapore's Changi airport is testing a facial recognition system it hopes will speed passengers through the facility.
"By Dave LeeTechnology reporter, BBC News Lawyer and activist Max Schrems said revelations by whistleblower Edward Snowden showed agreed privacy practices were being ignored by Facebook and others. He called for the current Safe Harbour deal, which allows the transfer of data to US firms, to be scrapped. Facebook has not commented on the case. At a hearing in Luxembourg on Tuesday the European Court of Justice's (ECJ) Advocate General said he would give his final opinion on 24 June - the ECJ will make its final decision thereafter. Privacy principles The result of the proceedings could have wide implications for all US firms dealing with Europeans' data, including the likes of Twitter, Google, Microsoft and Yahoo. It centres around the Safe Harbour agreement, in place since 2000, which allows US firms to collect data on their European users as long as certain principles around storage and security are upheld. It means user data gathered in Europe can easily be stored legally in data centres within the US. Those principles include giving adequate notice to users that their data is being collected, and suitable transparency over how it can be accessed and by whom. The ECJ is considering whether the Safe Harbour agreement is effective in the wake of the Snowden leaks. Mr Snowden alleged that Facebook and others were complicit in Prism, a surveillance system launched in 2007 by the US National Security Agency (NSA). Euro data A complaint against Facebook - which bases its European headquarters in Dublin, Ireland - was filed by Mr Schrems last year. He said the network should be investigated over the alleged co-operation with US intelligence agencies in handing over user data from Europeans. Mr Schrems said Facebook had acted against the Safe Harbour rules, and that local regulators should step in to protect Europeans' data. The Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC) said it would not investigate the claims, a decision that was challenged by Mr Schrems in the Irish High Court. Judge Duncan Hogan then referred the wider matter of whether Safe Harbour was effective to the ECJ. 'Serious effects' The ECJ's eventual decision could have a dramatic impact on the business practices of Facebook and other US firms. Scrapping the Safe Harbour agreement would make it much more difficult to transfer data from Europe to the US to be stored in data centres. While Facebook has not made a formal statement on the case, the BBC understands that the firm would be likely to welcome updating the Safe Harbour rules in light of the Snowden revelations. Some companies, such as Twitter, have said they would need to build new data centres in Europe to handle information, needlessly duplicating resources they already have in the US. According to the Wall Street Journal, a spokesman for the UK data regulator said in court that scrapping Safe Harbour would ""have quite serious effects... risking disruption of trade that carries significant benefit for the EU and its citizens"".

"Bryan Sartin, Verizon's head of global security services, said he was ""surprised"" more breaches had not become public. Companies that lose data face fines of up to 4% of their global revenues, under European data protection laws. Mr Sartin was speaking following the publication of a report analysing thousands of successful attacks. It revealed a growing threat to senior staff in large companies from well organised phishing attacks. Slow response The annual Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR) collates information from more than 2,000 confirmed breaches that hit large and small organisations all over the world. It also logs information about more than 40,000 incidents such as spam and malware campaigns and web attacks. ""There's a time bomb around these breaches,"" Mr Sartin told BBC News. ""There are so many investigations happening covering information under GDPR and at any moment any of those may leak or get some public attention,"" he said. The General Data Protection Regulation came into force in Europe in 2018 and requires companies that lose data to notify regulators quickly after a breach. Big fines can be levied if the organisation is judged to have not done enough to protect personal data or clean up after a breach. Mr Sartin said he was ""surprised"" so little information about data breaches had shown up in public in the 12 months since GDPR came into force. ""There's probably some big situations queuing up right now,"" he said. ""Compromises happen in minutes and then extend out to hours, days, weeks and some times months,"" said Mr Sartin. ""Yet we are still looking at months for them to be discovered."" The report revealed a shift in tactics by cyber-thieves, many of whom sought to steal the login details of senior staff so they could exploit the high-level access they enjoyed. ""When it comes to account takeover, senior executives are getting hit hard right now,"" Mr Sartin said. ""Humans are the weakest link in the chain especially when they are on their mobile device."" On a more positive note, said Mr Sartin, the report showed only 3% of those targeted fell victim to booby-trapped emails. In the 2018 report, the click rate was about 12%. The report also showed that cyber-thieves rarely executed attacks that required them to get past more than four defences. ""If you create a world where it takes five or more steps to get your data, we have little if any evidence of bad guys that will go that far,"" he said.","Data breaches are a ""time bomb"" under companies that let customer information go astray, warns a security expert."
"The bug only strikes those playing the game via Microsoft's Xbox 360 console. It revolves around a hidden feature that can only be activated by those that have modified their console. Gamers who play alongside people who have modded their console ""contract"" the bug which deletes their character if they die during play. The hidden option within the game, known as ""badass"" or ""hardcore"", is turned off by default but can be enabled by those that have modified or hacked their console. ""Modding"" involves altering the hardware or software in a console so it can run pirated games, development code or other non-official programs. Power play Modded consoles can enable the ""badass mode"" on Borderlands 2 which lets their characters gather special weapons and armour and become much more powerful than those created in ""normal"" mode. When a player with an unmodded console joins a Borderlands 2 multiplayer game in which there is a character running in badass mode it too gets kicked into that mode. ""Hence the 'virus' explanation - as with a cold or the flu in real life you can spread it to other people before noticing the symptoms, and without any evil intent, and they in turn can spread it on to others,"" explained one gamer on the forums of Borderlands 2 maker Gearbox. One consequence of the badass mode is that when characters die during gameplay they suffer permanent deletion rather than respawning. Gearbox warned about the problem on 22 October saying some gamers were using it to ""maliciously disrupt the experience and sabotage characters of legitimate Borderlands 2 players"". Since then the problem has become much more widespread with many posting complaints to the forum thread about long-running characters being deleted. Gearbox said it had prepared a fix that closed the loophole being exploited but it would take time for this to be fed out to consoles. In the meantime, Gearbox said, users players should only play with people they trust and avoid public games. To avoid characters being deleted, it said, players should use the ""save and quit"" option during play so they can reload that avatar later on. No advice has been given about how to resurrect characters that have been lost as a result of the ""badass"" bug.",A bug that works like a disease in humans is permanently killing off characters in the Borderlands 2 video game.
"By Leo KelionTechnology reporter, Las Vegas The South Korean firm is the world's best-selling maker of smart TVs, which allow people to surf the web and access other services via their main screen. But along with other smart TV makers, it has faced criticism that many people rarely use the added functionality. That has limited its ability to make money from the add-on services. The company also announced at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas that it would put a super-sized 110in (279cm) 4k ultra-high resolution LCD TV on display when the trade show started on Tuesday. Ultra-high definition offers four times as many pixels as today's 1080p HD standard, allowing screens to expand in size without sacrificing picture quality. Simultaneous viewing Executives also said they would show off a 55in OLED (organic light-emitting diode) display that could show two different shows full-screen at the same time. Users must wear special glasses with built-in headphones to view one programme and block the other. The innovation takes advantage of technology previously used to create a sense of 3D. However, it is not the first to show off the concept. Sony demonstrated similar technology in 2011, and despite Samsung's efforts some company watchers had hoped for more from the event. ""There were good announcements about smart TVs, 4k TVs and other connected devices,"" said Ichiro Ishiguro, an analyst at Hermes who has been coming to CES for 10 years. ""It sounds like they are doing what they have to do and are progressing as expected, but on the other hand there was nothing much surprising or exciting about the announcement today."" Recommended shows Samsung said its smart TV interface had been redesigned to be ""more visually appealing"". Users now swipe through five panels which take them between shows being broadcast at that time; on-demand programmes and movies; photos and other content sourced from connectable devices; social networks and Skype; and finally smart TV apps. The system also uses a facility called S Recommendation to suggest content based on the owner's past viewing habits which can take account of the way their choices change at different times of the day. A new T-commerce service will also allow users to identify the clothes stars are wearing and order their own copy of the outfit on selected programmes. To offer the new functionality Samsung has upgraded the equipment's computer processor. Owners of the previous generation TVs will be offered an upgrade hardware pack which they can slot into the back of their set, making good on a promise made last year. 'Marriage saver' Brandon Hill, editor of the Dailytech blog, said that while much of the technology was impressive it would probably remain too expensive for ""normal people"" for years to come. However, he thought the ability for two people to watch different shows at once might prove popular once it eventually became available to displays targeted at the mass market. ""It might save a few marriages even though it seems a bit gimmicky,"" he said. ""It will definitely filter down to the consumer market but it will just be a few years before we see it there. I guess it's a nice thing to show at CES but for 'real people' it doesn't mean much now."" Samsung's event also introduced new smart devices for the kitchen. They included a fridge-freezer featuring a compartment that can be switched between the the two states, and an oven that can cook two meals at different temperatures.",Samsung Electronics has taken steps to simplify the interface of its internet connected televisions in an attempt to make them more user-friendly.
"The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers said ""a possible glitch"" had allowed a limited number of users to view each other's details. Icann said it planned to close down its application system until Wednesday and was extending its application deadline. Registered organisations now have until 20 April to apply for the new domains. The process had been scheduled to end at midnight GMT on 12 April. ""We have learned of a possible glitch in the TLD [top level domain name] application system software that has allowed a limited number of users to view some other users' file names and user names in certain scenarios,"" Icann's chief operating officer Akram Atallah wrote in a statement . ""Out of an abundance of caution, we took the system offline to protect applicant data. We apologise for any concern this may have caused and will communicate on a regular basis on our website."" Name explosion The TLD extension promises to radically increase the number of website address endings. At present there are 22 generic suffixes such as .com and .org, and about 250 country codes including .uk and .de. The move could allow a company like Canon to operate web addresses ending in .canon, .ixus or .eoscamera. The Japanese camera maker has confirmed it is one of 839 parties involved in the process. Each registrant can apply for up to 50 net address endings. Organisations had to pay $185,000 (£116,000) in fees to take part. Successful applicants will face $25,000 in annual costs to maintain their domains. Icann had previously said it would announce who had applied for which of the gTLDs on 30 April. It did not say whether this date would be affected by the incident.",The new net suffix application process has been thrown into disarray after the body in charge of the scheme was forced to take its computers offline.
"The Hamburg data protection authority said the social network could not change people's chosen usernames or ask them to provide any official ID. The ruling came after Facebook blocked an account set up by a woman using a pseudonym and changed it to her name. Facebook said it was disappointed with the ruling, which German courts had previously said met European law. ""The use of authentic names on Facebook protects people's privacy and safety by ensuring people know who they're sharing and connecting with,"" the company said. The company's real-name policy has been the subject of recent protests outside its headquarters in California from demonstrators, including drag queens, Native Americans and domestic violence victims who believe anonymity is crucial to their personal safety. Some drag queens want to use their stage names on the site, while Native Americans' names often incorporate animals, natural features or other elements that can be wrongly identified as pseudonyms. The woman in Germany had wanted to use a pseudonym to avoid unsolicited contact in relation to her business. Privacy rights In October 2014, Facebook clarified its real-name policy, saying users would have to ""use the authentic name they use in real life"". But organisers of June's protest say the company has been slow to change its rules. The Hamburg watchdog, which regulates the social network in Germany, said making users sign up under their real names violated an individual's privacy rights. It also rejected an argument from Facebook that because the company's European offices were in Ireland, it should be subject to Irish law. In an audit in December 2011, Ireland's privacy watchdog ruled Facebook's real-name policy did not contravene the country's regulations. But Hamburg's commissioner for data protection, Johannes Caspar, said: ""For that matter, Facebook cannot again argue that only Irish data protection law would be applicable. Anyone who stands on our pitch also has to play our game.""","Facebook may not stop users in Germany creating accounts under false names, a Hamburg privacy watchdog has said."
"David Henshall told the Manchester Evening News that he came home from work and ""found they had barricaded my wife and daughter inside"". He emailed pictures of the work to Virgin Media chief executive Tom Mockridge. The firm apologised for the inconvenience. In a statement it said: ""Virgin Media expects the very highest standards of work from all its contractors. We will be discussing the matter with the contractors as a matter of urgency."" The home in Bolton was completely surrounded by fencing which in turn protected a newly-dug trench. ""My wife informs me that the workmen left at 2pm with no thought to the fact she could not move her car from our drive and it is stuck now,"" he told the paper. The incident does not appear to be an isolated one. On the Virgin Media community website, a member complained last month that workmen ""have dug right across the driveway"", blocking in a car and covering it in dust. Another asked this week: ""I am trying to find out who to speak to about Virgin laying cables and constantly digging up the road, then making a mess."" In February 2015, Virgin Media announced that it was to invest £3bn in improving its cable broadband service, increasing its network's reach from 13 million to 17 million homes.",A home in the north-west of England has been cut off by roadworks carried out by Virgin Media as part of its super-fast broadband rollout.
"By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter Video in general accounts for more than half of net traffic, it suggests. Other media streaming such as embedded video on websites accounts for 13.1%, YouTube, 11.4% and web browsing, 7.8%. The report also found that gaming and file-sharing are becoming a significant force in traffic volume. Video accounts for 58% of the total volume of downstream traffic on the internet, followed by web browsing (17%), gaming (7.8%) and social media (5.1%), according to the report. That is putting huge pressure on networks around the world and that pressure is likely to get worse, according to Sandvine's Global Internet Phenomena Report. ""The numbers for video are going to get higher as more and more content goes high definition and users turn more to 4K,"" said vice-president of marketing Cam Cullen. During peak evening hours, when networks are under ""the most stress"", Netflix can be accounting for 40% of all download traffic in the US, according to the report. However, the encoding technology used by the video streaming service makes it the most efficient video provider on the net. Piracy on rise Meanwhile, file-sharing services account for almost 22% of upload traffic, rising to 31% in Europe and the Middle East. ""If people can't get the content they want because they have to have multiple subscriptions or if it comes out a day later in their region and they don't want to see spoilers online, they resort to piracy,"" said Mr Cullen. Gaming is also adding to the growing traffic jam online, with the rise of streaming via services such as Twitch and games being purchased via download rather than a physical disc. For example, a downloaded copy of Call of Duty Black Ops uses up to 101GB of data, the equivalent of 14 hours of 4K video. People are also playing games for longer as the rise of professional gaming leagues tempts gamers to perfect their skills, ""Some now see gaming as a craft, not just a hobby,"" said Mr Cullen. The report also found regional variations in the type of content preferred. In the Asia-Pacific region, HTTP media streams (embedded video on websites) were most popular, followed by Facebook, with Netflix in third place. While in Europe, the top spot went to YouTube, followed by Netflix, HTTP media streams and Amazon Prime. In America, however, Amazon Prime was more popular than YouTube. According to the research, most traffic on the internet is now encrypted. While this is good news for consumers, because it means their data cannot be ""read"" by anyone gaining access to network traffic, it does not protect them from hacks or data breaches. The data used for the report was compiled from more than 150 service providers around the world, representing 2.1 billion subscribers.","Video streaming service Netflix is the world's most data-hungry application, consuming 15% of global net traffic, according to research from bandwidth management company Sandvine."
"The ""smart nappy"" uses strips in its absorbent area that change colour, around a patterned quick response (QR) code. A mobile app then takes a photo to analyse whether the panels show colours indicating an infection. But parenting experts have raised concerns that the idea could make parents more stressed. Urinary tract infections (UTI's) affect about 8% of babies, especially girls. The infections can be hard to detect before they have fully developed and symptoms such as fever and increased irritability show up. The smart nappy acts as a kind of early warning health system, alerting parents to a potential infection before it becomes a real problem. Different coloured squares measure interaction with the urine's components, including water content, protein and bacteria. Parents would be expected to scan a smart nappy in once a day to provide a build-up of data in the iOS or Android app, which could also be shared with medical professionals to diagnose possible kidney dysfunction or dehydration. But UK-based advice website Netmums says it is concerned this type of technology discourage parents from using common sense. ""Although at first glance it may seem like a clever idea, in reality it will probably leave sleep-deprived parents even more stressed and paranoid about their baby's health,"" said the site's founder Siobhan Freegard. ""As with any medical device which relies on users interpreting a coloured strip, there is room for error which could see children being dosed up with medicines they don't need and lots of extra GP visits 'just in case'."" Dr Su Laurent, from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said she was worried the nappy warning system would suffer from ""false positives"" - incorrectly identified infections - leading parents to make unnecessary trips to their GP. Susie Boone, editor of the Madeformums review site added that she thought parents should be able to spot most problems without needing a smartphone app. ""Whenever you change a nappy you'll notice changes in odour, consistency and volume of wee that's been absorbed, which may indicate a potential health issue,"" she said. ""Do we need an expensive high-tech nappy that does this for us? The answer's got to be no, unless your child has persistent urinary infections, when this could be a useful aid."" Diaper data The Smart Diaper is the invention of Jennie Rubinshteyn and Yaroslav Faybishenko. They were inspired on a drive back home to New York when their one-year-old daughter was crying in the back of the car. ""We realised she wasn't just sitting in a diaper full or urine but in a diaper full of data,"" they said. Mr Faybishenko said he thought the nappy would cost about a third more than regular disposables - a price tag which parenting website Babycentre said might be a barrier to adoption. ""Any new mum or dad will tell you that babies get through a lot of nappies and are something that parents are already spending a significant amount of money on"". The couple's start-up, PixieScientific, needs to put the idea through medical tests before it can convince regulators to approve it. And it is up against the clock too. The company has only two months to convince potential investors through crowdfunding site IndieGogo to raise $225,000 (£150,000) to make it possible to begin production. So far it has raised only a fraction of its goal. It also faces competition from established nappy makers. In May Huggies announced the TweetPee device, a moisture-measuring sensor that clips onto a nappy and then sends a message out to tell parents when their offspring need changing.",A husband-and-wife team in the US has invented a nappy that can detect if a baby is developing urinary problems.
"By Zoe KleinmanTechnology reporter, BBC News Details of an age verification tool developed by a major porn site owner were revealed at the weekend. From April 2018, porn site visitors in the UK will have to prove they are aged 18 or over to access adult material. The regulation is designed to protect children from explicit content. It is part of the UK government's Digital Economy Act. MindGeek, which runs sites including PornHub, YouPorn and RedTube, said its AgeID age verification tool had been in use in Germany since 2015. It said its software would use ""third-party age-verification companies"" to authenticate the age of those signing in. AgeID spokesman James Clark told the BBC there were multiple verification methods that could be used - including credit card, mobile SMS, passport and driving licence - but that it was not yet clear which would be compliant with the law. AgeID would be made commercially available to all porn sites accessible within the UK, MindGeek said, and would be offered free to independent UK studios, producers and bloggers. Once registered, users would be able to access multiple sites across multiple devices without logging in again, it said. MindGeek also said it would not store any data itself. ""We have created a tool to comply with the impending UK legislation, which both protects children from stumbling across adult content, and enables those of legal age to securely and privately access adult websites through a one-time verification process,"" said Mr Clark. However, the tool will be effective only for those who go directly to porn sites rather than use search engines or follow social media hashtags that include pornographic content. These could be blocked by the parental controls offered by most internet service providers. Mr Clark said the scope of the regulations were a matter for the regulator, the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC), but that AgeID would work across MindGeek's network and all others that signed up to use it. Treasure trove Myles Jackman, legal director of the Open Rights Group, said while MindGeek had said it would not hold or store data, it was not clear who would - and by signing in people would be revealing their sexual preferences. ""If the age verification process continues in its current fashion, it's a once-in-a-lifetime treasure trove of private information,"" he said. ""If it gets hacked, can British citizens ever trust the government again with their data? ""The big issues here are privacy and security."" Mr Jackman said it would drive more people to use virtual private networks (VPNs) - which mask a device's geographical location to circumvent local restrictions - or the anonymous web browser Tor. ""It is brutally ironic that when the government is trying to break all encryption in order to combat extremism, it is now forcing people to turn towards the dark web,"" he said. The chief executive of the BBFC, David Austin, said age verification was already in place for other services, including some video-on-demand sites. ""This is not about stopping adults from watching pornography that is legal; it is about making the internet a safer place for children,"" he said. ""There are a range of methods for verifying whether someone is 18 or over, and we expect to see a number of solutions offered by providers to give people different ways to verify their age.""","The Open Rights Group says it fears a data breach is ""inevitable"" as the deadline approaches for a controversial change in the way people in the UK access online pornography."
"By Dave LeeTechnology reporter, BBC News Hunter Moore used to post sexual images of men and women without their permission, along with links to their social networking profiles. Mr Moore said he will launch a new site soon, telling one technology blog he would also post home addresses. He later said he was ""misquoted"", but Anonymous has said he must be held ""accountable for his actions"". ""We will protect anyone who is victimised by abuse of our internet, we will prevent the stalking, rape, and possible murders as by-product of his sites,"" the group said in a media release. It added: ""Operation anti-bully. Operation hunt Hunter engaged. We are Anonymous, we are legion, we do not forgive, we do not forget, Hunter Moore, expect us."" IsAnyoneUp Mr Moore sold his old website, IsAnyoneUp.com, to an anti-bullying charity in April this year. Until that point it had gained notoriety for publishing pornographic pictures of men and women from all over the world, sent in by disgruntled ex-boyfriends and girlfriends. So-called ""revenge porn"" is common online, but Mr Moore's site angered anti-bullying campaigners further due to the inclusion of links to social networking sites - leaving victims open to large levels of abuse. People who had made requests for the photographs to be removed were often ridiculed further, and the huge majority of legal threats against Mr Moore were ignored. ""I sold it because I hated what the media turned it into and it could never be what I wanted it to be,"" Mr Moore has said about the closed site, which reportedly made him about $20,000 (£12,400; 15,335 euros) a month from advertising revenue. Speaking about his new venture, which has not yet launched, he said: ""This time I am doing it right. I am creating something that will question if you ever want to have kids. ""I am making something very scary but yet fun."" Suicide Mr Moore told technology blog Betabeat's Jessica Roy that the new site would ""introduce the mapping stuff so you can stalk people"", but in a subsequent interview with Salon magazine he took back the comment, stating that he made it while ""drunk"". Regardless of his intentions, Anonymous published details about Mr Moore online, including the names of family members and his home address. The group posted a video about their actions to Vimeo. In it, they showed pictures of Amanda Todd - a girl who committed suicide after topless photographs of her were circulated on the internet. Prior to her death, 15-year-old Miss Todd created a YouTube video describing how she was bullied. Mr Moore, who has said his new site has had thousands of submissions, has in the past said he holds no guilt over what he does. ""It's anonymous to me. I don't know the people - it's just a little picture on a screen,"" he told the BBC in an interview in April. ""If you're just crying over some [picture] you sent to some boy you just met, no I'm not going to take it down, and no I don't really care.""","The former owner of a ""revenge porn"" website has been threatened by hacktivist collective Anonymous."
"Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent@BBCRoryCJon Twitter On this week's Tech Tent, we ask just what a Biden administration might have in store for America's tech giants. It is clear that the mood music is not good. Our North America technology reporter James Clayton points out that the Biden camp has been talking negatively about tech companies, and in particular social media, for quite a while. Senator Amy Klobuchar, who had a leading role at Wednesday's inauguration, has even called for radical regulatory action in the form of the break-up of Google. But Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, appears to be public enemy number one in the eyes of the new administration. ""He is not a welcome figure at the cocktail party any more,"" says Sarah Miller, director of the American Economic Liberties Project and a member of the Biden transition team. ""I think Facebook is really broadly seen as the most prominent villain, among all the tech monopolists."" But while Facebook obviously needs to be worried, what is less clear is what form any regulatory action might take. All the talk has been about Section 230, the 1996 law which protects internet businesses from legal action over what users say on their platforms. It is widely credited with fuelling the growth of America's ""dot com"" economy. That it needs to be scrapped is one of the rare things Donald Trump and Joe Biden agree on. How that is to happen, and what might replace it, are far from clear. One issue is the differing priorities in Congress. Democrats want companies like Facebook to police content more rigorously, blaming the social media giant for spreading the kind of lies that they believe led to the storming of Congress on 6 January. Republicans, however, are angry about what they see as a threat to free speech from arrogant companies choosing to silence the likes of Donald Trump. Self-regulation? Facebook's decision to refer the Trump ban to its ""supreme court"", the Oversight Board, is an attempt to take the politics out of that issue. Lawmakers of all hues are unlikely to be satisfied with that kind of self-regulation, but so far they have come up with few ideas of how the US government could decide for itself what is allowed to happen online. Whatever emerges, if new regulation proves costly, that could actually end up benefiting the tech titans. The likes of Facebook can afford to employ tens of thousands of people to moderate content, while scrappy new challengers may be put off entering a heavily regulated market. If the stock market is any guide, the tech companies may not need to be too frightened of President Biden. Facebook's shares are recovering from a recent dip and, along with the other big-tech beasts, have boomed during the pandemic, powering the Nasdaq and Dow Jones Index to record highs. And for all the talk of a tech crackdown in the United States, there may be more serious threats elsewhere. With Google threatening to pull out of Australia over demands to pay publishers for content and the EU's Margrethe Vestager warning big tech to co-operate or face a patchwork of regulation from each country, the world seems to be at war with Silicon Valley. The Biden administration may be torn between launching its own offensive or stepping in to defend the companies on which much of America's future prosperity depends.","The world's leading technology nation has a new president, and one who seems pretty hostile to Silicon Valley."
"However, The Princess and the Fox was written not by the brothers, who died over 150 years ago, but by humans using an artificial intelligence (AI) tool. It's the first fairy tale written by an AI, claims Calm, and is the result of a collaboration with Botnik Studios - a community of writers, artists and developers. Calm says the technique could be referred to as ""literary cloning"". Botnik employees used a predictive-text program to generate words and phrases that might be found in the original Grimm fairytales. Human writers then pieced together sentences to form ""the rough shape of a story"", according to Jamie Brew, chief executive of Botnik. The full version is available to paying customers of Calm, but here's a short extract: ""Once upon a time, there was a golden horse with a golden saddle and a beautiful purple flower in its hair. The horse would carry the flower to the village where the princess danced for joy at the thought of looking so beautiful and good. ""'It's magnificent!' she said to her father, the king of bread and cheese. 'Will you give it something to eat and drink if I finally marry the prince?'"" It doesn't yet produce the finest prose, but Botnik's predictive keyboard is available for users to experiment with online. In addition to suggesting phrases based on the classic fairytales, it can also mimic the style of the Communist Manifesto, Buzzfeed quizzes and pancake recipes. So will artificial intelligence continue to generate new works from our favourite dead authors? 'Not really a novelty' The Princess and the Fox may be the first AI-powered fairytale, but the technique that produced it - using computers to generate content and then using humans to edit that content - is fairly widespread. Mario Klingemann, artist-in-residence at Google Arts and Culture, says that even the Marxist keyboard ""is not really a novelty"". ""This type of creative augmentation method has been used by artists and authors even before the advent of computers,"" he says. He points to William S Burroughs, who popularised what's referred to as the cut-up method of writing in the 1950s and 1960s: taking a piece of text, cutting it into pieces and rearranging it to form a new composition. ""It combines the permutational power of the machine with yet unchallenged human story-weaving and pattern-recognition skills,"" Klingemann says. ""At the same time, it forces our brains to think outside the beaten paths that we tend to fall back to."" Shelley AI There's no shortage of algorithms vying to be taken seriously as writers, and many other tools have been designed to work with humans on their output. Last year, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Media Lab developed Shelley AI, named after Mary Shelley, author of Frankenstein. The collaborative program was trained on horror tales written by Reddit users. It then tweeted snippets of new stories in the run-up to Halloween and took turns with human Twitter users at writing the next few sentences. More than 450 co-authored stories were produced at the end of the project. AI-assisted journalism, in which algorithms dig up interesting data and write key, fact-based sentences about the results, is becoming more common, too. Such machine-learning tools are increasingly being used in European newsrooms, though the focus is currently largely on developing programs that can help journalists rather than replace them. 'A different perspective' The Princess and the Fox is the second viral AI story from Botnik. Last winter, it published a machine-generated chapter of Harry Potter fan fiction called Harry Potter and the Portrait of What Looked Like a Large Pile of Ash. Luba Elliott, a curator specialising in artificial intelligence, says that using a machine can help give writers a different perspective on a story - but that humans are still deeply involved in the creation of these AI-generated stories. ""You can't just say, 'This is a 200-year-old lost tale from the Brothers Grimm and we just found it,'"" she says. ""Whoever creates an AI-generated story chooses the dataset, the model and also curates the final output. ""There is still a very strong involvement from writers.""","It was recently reported that the meditation app Calm had published a ""new"" fairytale by the Brothers Grimm."
"The new feature, called Search plus Your World, will automatically push results from Google+ up the search rankings. Tweeting on the news, Twitter's lawyer Alex Macgillivray described it as a ""bad day for the internet"". Google is determined to push its social network in the face of continued rivalry with Facebook. The current changes were about even greater personalisation, it said. It already includes personal search history in its search algorithms. The three changes are: ""Search is pretty amazing at finding that one needle in a haystack of billions of webpages, images, videos, news and much more,""said Amit Singhal in the firm's official blog. ""But clearly, that isn't enough. You should also be able to find your own stuff on the web, the people you know and things they've shared with you, as well as the people you don't know but might want to... all from one search box,"" he added. Twitter's general counsel Alex Macgillivray tweeted in response to the changes: ""Bad day for the internet. Having been there, I can imagine the dissension @Google to search being warped this way."" Mr Macgillivray had previously been employed at Google. Twitter expanded his point in an official statement. ""For years, people have relied on Google to deliver the most relevant results any time they wanted to find something on the internet. ""Often, they want to know more about world events and breaking news. Twitter has emerged as a vital source of this real-time information, with more than 100 million users sending 250 million tweets every day on virtually every topic. As we've seen time and time again, news breaks first on Twitter; as a result, Twitter accounts and tweets are often the most relevant results. ""We're concerned that as a result of Google's changes, finding this information will be much harder for everyone. We think that's bad for people, publishers, news organisations and Twitter users."" Google hit back at the criticisms. ''We are a bit surprised by Twitter's comments about Search plus Your World, because they chose not to renew their agreement with us last summer and since then we have observed their rel=nofollow instructions,"" it said in a statement. This refers to a technical barrier which makes it difficult for Google to rank Twitter information, a spokeswoman explained. There is also little sharing between Google and its other big rival Facebook. Stepping into the growing row between the three firms, Google chief executive Eric Schmidt told MarketingLand magazine that his company was not favouring its own social network over Facebook and Twitter. He said that all would be treated equally if the two rivals granted the search giant the right permissions to access their content. Search expert John Battelle saidin his blog postthat social search would mean little until Facebook and Google settled their differences and offered consumers what they really wanted - Facebook data integrated with Google's search. ""The unwillingness of Facebook and Google to share a public commons when it comes to the intersection of search and social is corrosive to the connective tissue of our shared culture,"" he said.",Twitter has complained about changes made by Google to integrate its social network Google+ into search results.
"Dave LeeNorth America technology reporter He won’t need to serve any lunch - there’s already more than enough beef to go around. Throughout his campaign to be elected president, Mr Trump put technology companies and their executives in the firing line, with calls for boycotts and accusations of tax-dodging. And with tax and immigration reform at the heart of his plans in the White House, there could be ample scope for fireworks between the leader-to-be and Silicon Valley’s most-powerful. Central to the discussions will be Peter Thiel. The Paypal founder, investor and Facebook board member is part of Mr Trump’s transition team after he offered energetic support during the campaign. Mr Thiel is well-respected in Silicon Valley and will serve to act as the bridge between the new administration and tech leaders. Who is Trump adviser Peter Thiel? We’ll likely only hear snippets of what gets discussed at the meeting, but here’s a breakdown of who’s reportedly going, and what they may discuss. From Facebook, it won’t be Mark Zuckerberg attending but Sheryl Sandberg, the company’s chief operating officer. Facebook is facing intense scrutiny over so-called “fake” or “false” news circulating on the site. Mr Trump has been seen to have been the beneficiary, so it’s unclear whether he’ll see this as a topic worth bringing up - much in the way he has dismissed claims Russia influenced the election through hacking. Ms Sandberg was a staunch supporter of Hillary Clinton, even being touted as a potential part of her cabinet. When Mr Trump won, Ms Sandberg put out a message urging Americans to work for a ""better future for everyone”. Apple boss Tim Cook will be there. Earlier this year furore grew over encryption - when Apple refused to unlock the San Bernardino killer’s iPhone - and Mr Trump called for an Apple boycott, apparently on a whim. That had no effect whatsoever, but the encryption debate will surely come up again under Mr Trump’s tenure. That whole row might just be brushed aside as campaign-trail bravado, but what will be more important to the president-elect will be the prospect of Apple making their iPhones in the USA rather than China. That could have serious implications for Apple’s bottom line and would take years to execute. More simple would be for Apple to put money into the SoftBank fund that Mr Trump heralded recently. That would please all parties - Apple makes an apparently sensible investment, and Mr Trump gets to say he’s convinced Apple to invest more in American jobs. Tesla’s chief executive Elon Musk may be there. Though he at first said he was otherwise engaged, now it looks like he will be attending. For Mr Musk, the chief concern will surely be Mr Trump’s view on renewable energy. Tesla benefits massively from tax breaks, as do the people who buy Tesla cars. Those breaks are gradually disappearing - but how quickly they go may be down to Mr Trump who has pledged to prioritise other energy sources like so-called ""clean"" coal. One area they may both get excited about, however, is future space travel - Mr Musk is the leading figure in the effort to put a human on Mars. Google’s parent company Alphabet is being represented by the search engine’s co-founder, Larry Page. Mr Trump amplified the conspiracy theory that Google was suppressing “bad” news about Hillary Clinton during the campaign. Google strongly denied the claims in a blog post. Again, probably more campaign-trail bravado. And then there’s Amazon’s Jeff Bezos. Mr Trump has accused the billionaire of using the Washington Post, which he owns, to pressure politicians into letting Amazon get away with paying less tax. Mr Bezos offered to fire Mr Trump into space in a rocket. Mr Trump’s hatred of the Post could see Mr Bezos singled out at the meeting - it was the newspaper that published the infamous “locker room talk” video during the campaign. Mr Bezos has been kinder to the president-elect since his election win, however - tweeting that he offers Mr Trump his ""most open mind and wish him great success in his service to the country."" Other attendees expected include the chief executives at Intel, Microsoft, Cisco, IBM and Oracle. Interestingly, it appears there is no place for Twitter’s Jack Dorsey, despite the platform being Mr Trump’s favoured social network. Only Oracle’s Safra Catz has spoken publicly about the meeting. ""If he can reform the tax code, reduce regulation and negotiate better trade deals, the US technology industry will be stronger and more competitive than ever,” she said. The topic that affects all of those attending is immigration. Tech companies are worried sick that Mr Trump’s stance on the H1-B visa (he doesn’t like it) will mean they are less able to recruit high-quality skilled workers from overseas. On tax, a lowering of US corporation tax could tempt tech companies, who stash cash in overseas offices, to bring their profits back to the US. This would be seen as a big win for Mr Trump and a publicity coup for the technology companies who are under fire for placing huge amounts of money in places like Ireland where they have relatively little sales but terrific tax conditions. The willingness of tech leaders, who were so vocal against Mr Trump before the election, to meet privately with Mr Trump has not played well with some key figures in Silicon Valley. Recode’s Kara Swisher, the industry’s most influential journalist, lambasted the leaders for attending the meeting and not speaking out publicly against some of Mr Trump’s policies. She said tech leaders would get ""exactly nothing for handing over their dignity”. She argued that the tech industry was powerful enough to have real influence on Mr Trump but, in public at least, was being soft on his campaign rhetoric.

"Mr Schmidt fought back at claims that Google enjoyed unrivalled dominance of the online search market. ""Many people think our main competition is Bing or Yahoo. But, really, our biggest search competitor is Amazon,"" he said in a speech in Berlin. Google is in the middle of a European Union probe into its search engine after anti-trust complaints. In February, it avoided paying what could have resulted in billions in fines when it agreed to give equal standing to rival services such as Microsoft in its search results. But Mr Schmidt pointed out that competition in the online world ""isn't always like-for-like"". ""People don't think of Amazon as search, but if you are looking for something to buy, you are more often than not looking for it on Amazon,"" he said. ""They are obviously more focused on the commerce side of the equation, but, at their roots, they are answering users' questions and searches, just as we are."" Amazon's big move Amazon, the world's largest online retailer, has been in the news recently for moves beyond its core e-commerce business. In August, it bought live-streaming gaming network Twitch Interactive for about $970m (£603m), marking the biggest acquisition in its 20-year history. Google was earlier reported to be in talks to buy Twitch. However, even though Google holds the dominant position - accounting for more than 90% of the online search market - Mr Schmidt said he was still wary of the ""next Google"". ""Someone, somewhere in a garage is gunning for us. I know, because not long ago we were in that garage. Change comes from where you least expect it,"" he added.",Google chairman Eric Schmidt has said the firm's biggest rival in online search is e-commerce giant Amazon.
"By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor The feature appears on both the web and app versions of its service, and aims to make it easier for users to ""discover, watch and share"" clips uploaded to its servers. It builds on wider efforts to make the social network more video-centric. One expert said that it posed a serious challenge to Google-owned YouTube, which has long dominated ad-supported videos on the net. ""Facebook already accounts for about 20% of the time people spend online, and it has an unbelievable level of data about its users, which is very interesting for ad-funded content providers,"" said Ian Maude, from Enders Analysis. ""If it can marry high-quality content and more personalised targeting through the information it has on all of us, then that's the Holy Grail for marketers."" Facebook said only a ""small number of people"" would initially be able to see the feature while it was being tested. Saved clips The new section is accessed via an icon at the bottom of the screen in Facebook's app and in the Favourites section on the top left-hand side of its web page. For now, it is limited to suggested clips based on a user's own activities on the network as well as those of their friends, but a spokeswoman said that a search function might be added in the future. Once the viewer starts watching a clip, they can quickly switch to another one by flicking upwards on the screen of the app. ""We also know that sometimes people want to watch a video, but they don't have time or aren't in a place where they can turn on sound,"" added Facebook executive Will Cathcart. ""To make it easy to return to the videos you're interested in, we've been testing a button that allows you to save a video to watch later, which can be accessed in your Saved bookmark."" In addition, Facebook is testing letting clips continue playing in a floating window superimposed over the screen when a user scrolls through their News Feed, rather than the current set-up that anchors clips to the page and stops them streaming when they move beyond the display. Paying creators Facebook revealed earlier in the year that it was achieving about four billion video clip views a day. Beyond encouraging users to spend longer on the service, Facebook is also experimenting with placing ads between the initial clip the user clicks on and other ""suggested"" videos it then promotes as follow-up views. To persuade video-makers to upload their clips to its service - rather than just post links to YouTube or other hosting sites - it also recently announced plans to share the revenue generated by these adverts. ""A year or two from now, we think Facebook will be mostly video,"" the platform's advertising chief said last month. Threat to YouTube YouTube has publicly tried to play down the threat Facebook poses. The growing demand for online video meant ""it will be a decade before we bump into each other,"" YouTube's head of content, Robert Kyncl, told the Financial Times in July. And earlier this week it revealed that the amount of time UK-based users had spent watching its clips had risen by 60% over the previous 12 months. However, the BBC understands that privately Google takes the threat seriously. ""This has been building up for a while,"" said Mr Maude. ""Facebook wants to become a destination for rich content - not just news about your friends and what they are up to. ""And adding professional content in particular is a way to not just drive up the amount of time people spend on the site, but also the pricing it can charge for associated advertising.""",Facebook is testing a new video section on its platform.
"The details had probably been uploaded by a criminal gang, security experts said. It is suspected the data was taken from computers infected with malicious software that logged key presses. It is not known how old the details are - but the experts warned that even out-dated information posed a risk. ""We don't know how many of these details still work,"" said security researcher Graham Cluley. ""But we know that 30-40% of people use the same passwords on different websites. ""That's certainly something people shouldn't do."" Criminal botnet The site containing the passwords was discovered by researchers working for security firm Trustwave. In a blog post outlining its findings, the team said it believed the passwords had been harvested by a large botnet - dubbed Pony - that had scooped up information from thousands of infected computers worldwide. A botnet is a network of machines controlled by criminals thanks to malicious software being installed on to computers without the owner's knowledge. Often, criminal gangs will use botnets to steal large amounts of personal data, which can then be sold on to others or held to ransom. In this instance, it was log-in information for popular social networks that featured most heavily. The site - written in Russian - claimed to offer 318,121 username and password combinations for Facebook. Other services, including Google, Yahoo, Twitter and LinkedIn, all had entries in the database. Russian-language sites VKontakte and Odnoklassniki also featured. Chocolate teapot passwords Trustwave said it had notified the sites and services hit prior to posting the blog entry. Facebook highlighted that it was not at fault, and that this security risk was due to infected user machines. ""While details of this case are not yet clear, it appears that people's computers may have been attacked by hackers using malware to scrape information directly from their web browsers,"" a spokesman said in an email. ""People can help protect themselves when using Facebook by activating Login Approvals and Login Notifications in their security settings. ""They will be notified when anyone tries to access their account from an unrecognized browser and new logins will require a unique passcode generated on their mobile phone."" The social network said all of the users found in the database had been put through a password reset process. Analysis of the passwords by Trustwave showed a familiar picture - the most popular password, found in the database over 15,000 times, was ""123456"". Such predictable combinations made passwords completely ineffective, said Mr Cluley. ""It's as much use a chocolate teapot,"" he said. ""Absolutely useless.""","More than two million stolen passwords used for sites such as Facebook, Google and Yahoo and other web services have been posted online."
"By Dave LeeTechnology reporter, BBC News The Facebook-owned company also revealed it is working on its own handheld controller system called Oculus Touch. The Rift headset will be released early next year. Until now, only a ""developer"" version had been sold. It will compete with rival VR headsets such as Sony's Morpheus and HTC's Vive. Google has made a more basic entry into the market with its Cardboard product, which uses a person's smartphone to create a VR effect. The deal with Microsoft means Oculus owners will be able to stream Xbox One games to the headset and see them as if they are being viewed on a huge ""home cinema"" screen. Microsoft's gaming boss Phil Spencer made a surprise appearance at the event to introduce the partnership. But he did not discuss whether the Xbox One would offer VR games of its own - allowing players to experience immersive 360-degree views - via the headset. However, Mr Spencer hinted that more information would be shared at next week's E3 conference in Los Angeles. ""The Microsoft deal with Oculus seems like a risk-free way to try and undermine Morpheus' advantage,"" commented Piers-Harding Rolls, a video games industry analyst at the IHS consultancy. ""But streaming XBox One games... is not going to sell Oculus. ""The video of the experience didn't look compelling."" 'Something huge' Oculus founder Palmer Luckey said his firm had been looking at new ways for gamers to interact with virtual reality beyond using a console gamepad. He showed off the prototype Oculus Touch system, which consists of two wireless handheld controllers fitted with buttons, joypads and sensors. He said they were designed to make sense of the kinds of gestures people made naturally with their hands. Ben Wood, an analyst at CCS Insight, said the launch put Oculus in the ""driver's seat"" in the VR market. ""With Facebook's resources it has a huge head-start over rivals and its already delivered two iterations of its developer platform,"" he told the BBC. ""Furthermore, it's the brand that is synonymous with virtual reality technology."" Crowdfunded origins The Rift headset began its life as a crowdfunded Kickstarter project, raising $2.4m (£1.5m). It was later bought by Facebook for $2bn in 2014. ""We consider virtual reality has the potential to be one of the most disruptive technologies for a decade,"" said Mr Wood. ""You only have to look at the huge investments being made by companies like Facebook, Google, HTC, Sony and many others to realise we are on the cusp of something huge."" Jason Rubin, head of Oculus Studios, introduced some early titles designed for the Rift, including Eve Valkyrie, a first-person shooting game, and role-playing game Chronos. Oculus' head of development strategy Anna Sweet also announced a $10m fund for independent developers to spur on the creation of games for the platform. Attracting developers to the Rift will be critical to Oculus's success, said Brian Blau, an analyst at Gartner. ""They're all going to be competing hard for those developers to support their platforms - that's where you're going to see the real competition,"" he said. ""Games developers are going to have a lot of difficult choices to make.""

"By Zoe KleinmanTechnology reporter, BBC News It highlights the risk of investing in product ideas before they have actually launched. Ampy says the complaints are being made by a small minority. The battery pack is designed to be worn on the arm or elsewhere around the body. The idea is that movement shakes internal magnets which generate current that is then stored in the battery. There are three LEDs which indicate how much energy is stored - three lights means it is fully charged. While this is its main selling point, the Ampy can also be charged by being plugged into the wall. The battery retails at $100 (£70). The armband costs a further $29 (£20) and there are additional customs fees payable on deliveries outside of the US. Ampy has received more than $300,000 (£207,000) in crowd funding from 2,573 backers and a further $875,000 (£604,000) in venture capital investment. The BBC could only find one positive comment on the device's Kickstarter page (it is now closed but investors can still leave feedback) since the Ampy shipped in November 2015. However, the firm says it has shipped ""between 6,000 and 7,000 units"" so far, has issued 71 refunds and honoured 68 warranty claims. Its reviews on Amazon are polarised with (at time of writing) 39% giving it five stars and 31% one star. There are 10 five-star reviews. One of those writers said it had changed her life while another described it as ""super helpful"". Three of the 10 reviewers have never reviewed anything on Amazon apart from Ampy, according to their profiles. Three more were anonymous and one had not written a single review in more than two years. Tech news website Cnet awarded it 1.5 stars in a press review. ""No matter what I did, I couldn't get the Ampy to generate any reasonable amount of juice,"" wrote Sean Hollister. Jump start So what's going on? I decided to buy one myself and find out. After a 60-minute run I had not even generated enough charge to light the first of the three LEDs. I then gave it to my children's dad who then wore it during an energetic play in the park with our two sons. When he got back, I jumped on a friend's garden trampoline for half an hour, holding the Ampy and giving it a good shake. After all that, there was still no LED activity. When I plugged in my phone it charged for just over three minutes but the battery percentage on the phone itself remained unchanged at 67%. Then I flung it in my handbag where it remained for days while I stomped around with it at work and out with my kids (apparently bag action also counts). Still nothing. One reviewer, after far more technical tests than mine, and a teardown of the device itself came to the conclusion that it would take ""36 hours of activity"" to fully charge the Ampy battery itself. ""I think when you tell people you move and then you can charge your phone - people have a high expectation of that and it will seem almost magical,"" co-founder Alex Smith told me. ""We can say this product isn't for everyone. It is for people who have an active lifestyle"". This however is not explicit on the Ampy website. He said I should have seen better results from my activities and asked me about the make of my smartphone, how old it was and how bright the screen setting was - all limiting factors in the effectiveness of the device, he said. ""One of the issues is, when this product came out, the most popular phone on the market was iPhone 5. Since then phones have got a lot bigger. The battery is twice as big. Most power from comes from screen size,"" he added. 'Premium product' The Ampy is a lifestyle product, Mr Smith continued. ""A Fitbit gives you badges, this gives you battery life,"" he said. ""We are not promising it is going to replace [charging at the] wall."" On the subject of negative feedback he said it is ""often difficult to meet people's expectations"". ""We think a lot of our customers are very happy,"" he added. ""The ones who aren't are the most vocal"". Right idea Ampy put me in touch with four supportive Kickstarter backers. They were all pleased to have invested in the concept and liked the device - but three of them admitted that the motion charge they were actually generating was very small. ""I have to wear it all day and maybe I'll be able to charge my phone for five or six minutes,"" said Di-Lan Sun in the Netherlands. ""But I think it's a great way of doing something with sustainable power. That's important."" Martin Stradling in Canada agreed that the motion charging ""wasn't as good"" as he expected. ""Everything has to start somewhere.... it's the right idea and a step in the right direction,"" he said. Rocco Turso in South Carolina said he kept his Ampy charged via his computer and ""topped up"" with movement and walker Laurene Beattie said she kept the Ampy in her bag and was able to recharge her phone by up to 50% when needed but added that while she always carried it, she did not use it every day. Energy harvesting Clare Grey is a chemistry professor at Cambridge University and an expert on energy storage. I asked her for her thoughts. By her calculations it would take 13 hours to fully charge the battery of an iPhone 6, based on the current capacity of the Ampy as described on the firm's blog. ""The energy required for [smartphone-like] devices is substantial,"" she said. ""You're making use of something you're doing anyhow but the general problem with energy harvesting is that all these methods are not very efficient."" However it would be unwise to write off these sorts of devices just yet, she added. ""Energy-harvesting devices have a role to play and will increasingly play a role in the internet-connected lifestyles we will have,"" Prof Grey said. A spokesman for Kickstarter said that crowdfunders who invested in hardware products were supporting their development rather than the actual products. ""It's a system that works best when creators are open and honest about their progress and the challenges they're facing,"" he said in an email. ""There's always a risk that a project won't turn out as planned.""","There's growing anger among the supporters of Ampy, a Kickstarter-funded wearable battery charger which promised to ""power your devices from your motion"" but has been described by disappointed investors as ""a deadweight"" and ""an overpriced brick""."
"More than 26,000 fake banknotes had been bought from - and delivered by - the gang, according to the agency. The estimated face value of the notes was about 1.3m euros ($1.4m; £1.1m). A total of 11 arrests have been made and a further 33 suspects have been detained for questioning. Europol said a total of 36 homes, across Germany, Austria, France, Greece, Ireland, Luxembourg and Spain, had been searched. A print shop in Lower Saxony, Germany, said to have specialised in fake documents, has also been dismantled. To minimise the risk of the suspects alerting each other, the police carried out the raids over a short period of time between 9 and 11 December. The effort was a follow-up to an earlier operation, dubbed Deep Money, which had targeted the crime gang involved in making and distributing the fake currency. In September, it was announced that five suspected members of the Portugal-based crime ring had been arrested and materials including ultraviolet inks and holographic bands, involved in the production of the fake currency, had been seized. That had involved the extradition from Colombia of the alleged gang chief. A spokeswoman for Europol told the BBC that many of the counterfeit bank notes had been sold via Wall Street Market. The online marketplace had operated on the Tor network, which requires special software to access and meant the site had not been indexed by regular search engines such as Google. The fake notes had been traded for cryptocurrencies, which buyers had used to try to keep their identities hidden. Sales had been carried out via private messages and other encrypted chat platforms in a further effort to hide the activity. Wall Street Market was taken offline by the German Federal Criminal Police in May, after being in business for about three years. The authorities said that illegal drugs and malware had also been sold via the site. Earlier in the year, the European Central Bank reported that counterfeiting Euro bank notes appeared to be on the decline. It based its analysis on the fact that a total of 251,000 counterfeit banknotes were withdrawn from circulation in the first half of 2019 - about a third less than for the same period in 2017.",Police have carried out house raids across Europe targeting buyers of fake banknotes made by what Europol said was the darknet's second-largest counterfeit currency producer.
"Witnesses told police Timothy Wilks and a friend had approached a group of people outside a family trampoline park in Nashville, holding large knives. Mr Wilks was then shot by a 23-year-old, who told police he had had no idea it had been a ""prank"" and had been acting in self-defence. Mr Wilks's friend told officers the ""prank"" had been for a YouTube video. No-one has been arrested over the death. Several families had been inside the Urban Air trampoline and adventure park, which describes itself as ""kid friendly"" and ""family fun"", at the time of the shooting, 21:20, local news outlet WKRN reported. Robbery ""prank videos"" are relatively common on YouTube, sometimes involving fake firearms, balaclavas or getaway vehicles. Some have millions of views - though many of those are themselves faked, with all participants being ""in"" on the video and acting their part. But YouTube brought in rules banning dangerous or threatening pranks two years ago. That includes ""pranks that lead victims to fear imminent serious physical danger or that create serious emotional distress in minors"". Threats with weapons and fake robberies are specifically listed as offences that would result in the video being taken down. Thick book The new rules were brought in after a number of high-profile precedents. In 2015, the tech giant refused to remove a video in which vlogger Sam Pepper tricked a man into thinking his friend had been shot and killed. But in 2017, a stunt by two YouTubers ended in a death, when Monalisa Perez, then 19, shot at her boyfriend, Pedro Ruiz, through a thick book, which he believed would stop a bullet. Perez was imprisoned for six months in March 2018 for the shooting. And YouTube banned dangerous pranks about 10 months later.","A 20-year-old has been shot dead allegedly taking part in a ""prank"" robbery being filmed for YouTube."
"The cross-party group said that Facebook used its Onavo virtual private network (VPN) app to gather information on competitors. The MPs claim Facebook ""intentionally and knowingly violated both data privacy and anti-competition laws"". The report, which is more than 100 pages long, also details the influence of fake news on the site in elections. Monitoring competitors The Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee wrote that through the use of Onavo, which was billed as a way to give users an extra layer of security, Facebook could ""collect app usage data from its customers to assess not only how many people had downloaded apps, but how often they used them"". The report added: ""This knowledge helped them to decide which companies were performing well and therefore gave them invaluable data on possible competitors. They could then acquire those companies, or shut down those they judged to be a threat."" A graph the committee includes in the report shows an analysis of data collected with Onavo, detailing how commonly apps were used by Facebook owned and rival services. In 2013, Facebook offered to buy rival Snapchat for $3bn (£2.32bn). It acquired Instagram a year earlier for $1bn. In 2014, the company successfully acquired WhatsApp for $19bn in cash and shares. Limiting Vine The report also details the way the company could shut off access to its services to competitors. For example, in 2013 Facebook founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg was informed about the launch of the Vine video service by social media rival Twitter. He was told via email that Twitter was going to allow Vine users to find friends on Facebook. ""Unless anyone raises objections, we will shut down their friends' API access today."" the email read - a move that would prevent Vine users from inviting their Facebook friends to the service. Zuckerberg agreed to the move, replying ""Yup, go for it."" Twitter eventually chose to close Vine in 2016. Whitelisting According to the report, as of November 2013, more than 5,000 apps on Facebook were ""whitelisted"", meaning that they could gain special access to user data and the data of those user's Facebook friends. Whitelisted companies included ride-hailing app Lyft, Airbnb and Netflix. An internal email discussed linking a yearly spend of $250,000 on advertising to maintain company access to user Facebook data. An email from Mr Zuckerberg, sent in October 2012, outlined his scepticism about the risk of data leaks happening between Facebook application developers. ""I think we leak info to developers, but I just can't think of any instances where that data has leaked from developer to developer and caused a real issue for us,"" he wrote. Last year, Facebook was fined £500,000 by the UK's data protection watchdog for its role in the Cambridge Analytica scandal. The Information Commissioner's Office said that the social media giant had given developers access to user data ""without clear consent"". User data which was collected through a personality quiz was used by Cambridge Analytica to profile potential voters.","A report by a Commons committee has detailed Facebook's use of an application to ""spy"" on users."
"Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent@BBCRoryCJon Twitter The letter comes from the Department for Education but it sets out a list of demands from Downing Street, with the stated aim of allowing the prime minister to make an announcement shortly. The companies are asked, among other things, for a commitment to fund an ""awareness campaign"" for parents. They're not particularly happy about promising cash for what the letter concedes is an ""unknown campaign"" but it's the next item on the menu which is the source of most of their anger. This asks them to change the language they are using to describe the net safety filters they will be offering to internet users. Instead of talking of ""active choice +"", they are urged to use the term default-on. The letter says this can be done ""without changing what you're offering"". A person at one ISP told me the request was ""staggering - asking us to market active choice as default-on is both misleading and potentially harmful"". A little background on this issue might be helpful. For a long time, certain politicians and newspapers have been campaigning for default-on filters. They would like to see harmful and offensive - if legal - material blocked by the internet service providers unless customers choose to have the filters switched off. ""It sounds like a good idea until you think it through,"" said one industry source. ""There are three reasons why it doesn't work. First it may be illegal under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers. Then there's the fact that no filter is perfect, and finally kids are smart enough to find their way around them."" A source at another company saw another reason why ""default on"" might be a bad idea: ""It makes parents complacent - if you tell them the filter is switched on by default, they get a false sense of security. We want parents to make informed choices about the way their children use the internet."" And the companies point out that the man the government chose to examine this issue, Reg Bailey of the Mothers' Union, was also dubious about the use of default-on filters, wanting parents to be more active in understanding online dangers. So the ISPs are instead offering something they call Active Choice, where customers are asked to make informed decisions about the level of filtering. Critics may say they are just quibbling about language, but the companies believe the precise wording is important - and they're angry at what they see as the government urging them to mislead their customers. ""What this is about is allowing the government and certain papers to declare a victory,"" said one industry source. ""This country has led the world in blocking child abuse images, but they just want to keep the story bubbling on."" When I sought a response, Downing Street told me it never commented on leaks, but a spokesman said ""the government continues to work with internet service providers to help keep children safe online."" At lunchtime today the internet providers will be meeting Claire Perry, the Prime Minister's special advisor on child safety issues, to give their response to the letter. Both sides appear to mistrust each others' motives, so finding an outcome that enhances child safety while producing an acceptable headline will prove tricky. Here's the letter sent to the ISPs by the Department for Education, unedited and in full: Dear All, I am emailing to ask for some specific action which the prime minister plans to announce shortly. This follows a meeting yesterday at No 10 yesterday to discuss a range of child internet safety issues including parental controls and filters. The prime minister would like to make some further specific requests of industry and his office have asked us to ask you when you could deliver the following actions. 1. Implementing browser intercept I understand that Talk Talk will be trialling a ""browser intercept"" to force existing customers to choose either to proceed with parental controls (pre-ticked), choose their own settings or turn them off completely. The prime minister wants to announce that by the end of the year, every household with a broadband internet connection will have had to make a decision to ""opt-out"" of installing filters. Will the other three ISPs consider making a commitment to adopting this approach - even before it has been trialled? 2. Age-verification systems/closed-loop The prime minister expects customers to be required to prove their age/identity before any changes to the filters are made. I understand that you will all be implementing ""closed-loop"" systems which will notify account holders of any changes that are made to the filters and that you have robust systems in place but please could you all confirm the precise information that is required to enable customer to access, set-up and change their filters? 3. Awareness campaign for parents I understand that it was agreed at Claire Perry's meeting a few weeks ago that Talk Talk, BT and others would undertake some further research to establish what the focus of the campaign should be. The prime minister would like to be able to announce a collective financial commitment from industry to fund this campaign. I know that it will be challenging for you to commit to an unknown campaign but please can you indicate what sum you will pledge to this work that the PM can announce. 4. Using the phrase ""default-on"" instead of ""active-choice +"" The prime minister believes that there is much more that we can all do to improve how we communicate the current position on parental internet controls and that there is a need for a simplified message to reassure parents and the public more generally. Without changing what you will be offering (ie active-choice +), the prime minister would like to be able to refer to your solutions are ""default-on"" as people will have to make a choice not to have the filters (by unticking the box). Can you consider how to include this language (or similar) in the screens that begin the set-up process? For example, ""this connection includes family-friendly filters as default [or as standard] - if you do not want to install this protection please un-tick the box"" (obviously not intended to be drafting). Would you be able to commit to including ""default-on"" or similar language both in the set-up screen and public messaging? We are all aware of the really excellent work that you are doing and but there are a number of specific areas that the prime minister thinks need further immediate action. You are likely to receive a further message from colleagues in DCMS and the Home Office regarding tackling illegal images but given the short deadline for this work we thought it better to give you some time to work on these issues in the meantime. I need to report back to No 10 by the end of the week on these points so I would be grateful if you could consider this request as a matter of urgency and respond by midday Friday. Apologies for the very tight deadline and grateful for your help with this work.",I've written before on the dialogue of the deaf between politicians and the internet industry over child internet safety - and now the relationship seems to be getting even worse. A letter sent to the UK's four leading ISPs from the government has made them very cross indeed. So cross that someone in the industry has passed it to me - you can read it in full below.
"Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent@BBCRoryCJon Twitter On the Tech Tent podcast this week, we ask whether there is convincing evidence that spending hours staring at smartphones and other screens is damaging the mental health of young people. If you read news headlines - or indeed the government's Online Harms White Paper - you might think that the case against screen time was a no-brainer. But this week, a study by the Oxford Internet Institute suggested that it had little obvious effect on the mental wellbeing of teenagers, even if they were spending hours staring at screens at bedtime. ""We look at general wellbeing,"" one of the researchers, Amy Orben, tells us. ""We do not find a relationship between digital screen use 30 minutes, one hour and two hours before bed and a decrease in wellbeing."" The research examined data from more than 17,000 teenagers in the UK, Ireland and the United States. Ms Orben tells us that, unlike some other studies, their work does not rely solely on what people report about their own screen time. ""People are really bad at estimating how much they use phones and technology in their everyday life,"" she explains ""We've actually seen in previous research that the overlap between their self-reported phone use and their actual use when it is tracked is absolutely minimal."" Robust study Critics have pointed out that some of the Oxford data dates back to 2011. Since then, adolescents' screen time and the nature of what they are viewing has changed. There is plenty of anecdotal evidence that no matter how long teenagers are spending looking at screens, they are encountering material about issues such as anorexia and self-harm that could prove damaging to their mental health. The Oxford researchers are confident that their study is robust in its finding that any correlation between screen time and mental health is very small. ""That crucially does not mean that I'm saying that there might not be a type of digital technologies that is harmful, or is very beneficial,"" says Ms Orben. But she says more research is needed. ""I think this study is only a first step. We need to be asking better questions."" Meanwhile, whatever the evidence, the drive to regulate the internet is gathering pace. Also on this week's podcast: Stream the latest Tech Tent podcast on BBC Sounds.",The UK government's plans for regulation of the internet and social media contained a long list of online harms.

"Some users in the US reported that Yahoo Mail was displaying a message asking them to disable their ad-blocker before they could access their inbox. Yahoo said it was testing a ""new product experience"" in the US. Members of one ad-blocking forum said they had already managed to circumvent the restriction. Malware Ad-blocking has proved to be controversial and technology companies have responded in different ways. In September, Apple updated its mobile operating system iOS to allow third-party ad-blockers to be installed - although they do not remove Apple's own ads which it serves up in apps. Google meanwhile has introduced a paid subscription version of YouTube, that lets viewers remove ads on the video streaming site for a monthly fee. Ad-blocking advocates say disabling advertisements can improve smartphone battery life and reduce mobile data usage. It can also prevent people being tracked by advertisers online and protect devices from malware that could be served up if an advertising network is compromised.

"By Chris VallanceTechnology reporter, BBC News ""Consider our gast well and truly flabbered,"" blogged Liz Upton of the Raspberry Pi team in response to news that an auction of 10 trial versions of the computers had attracted offers worth thousands of pounds. The highest bid for one of the beta versions is over £3,000, more than a hundred times the planned asking price for the most expensive model of £22. The uncased, credit-card sized, 700MHz machines are an unlikely gadget must-have. But with a mailing list of more than 50,000 members, Raspberry Pi have found that plenty of people think they're a good thing. The Pi's creators hope the bare-bones computers will play an important part in encouraging children to code. The beta machines on auction were produced as a test ahead of a longer production run; proceeds will support the project. ""We found one small error which we've manually fixed,"" Eben Upton, founder and trustee of the Raspberry Pi Foundation told the BBC. Fixing these early boards involved adding a blob of solder ""using a microscope and a scalpel"", he said. ""Unforgeable proof that this really is a limited edition."" The first tranche of machines is expected to begin production this month. Mr Upton was not able to give exact numbers but said it would likely be in ""the low thousands"". Micro revival The Pi's backers have drawn inspiration from the BBC Micro. Produced in the 1980s by Acorn computers for the BBC Computer Literacy Project, they were widely adopted in British Schools. BBC Basic, the programming language which ran on the machines, provided a gentle introduction to the challenges of coding. Many in the UK IT industry trace their interest in computing back to such early coding experiences. ""If you think back to the 1980s the BBC Micro was the cornerstone of computing in schools,"" Ian Livingstone, life president of games company Eidos, told the BBC. Mr Livingstone co-authored, with Alex Hope, of visual effects company Double Negative, theNext Gen report- an examination of how IT education in UK schools could better meet the needs of the games and visual effects industries. He's critical of the way IT is currently taught in UK schools. In his view it is often: ""Nothing more than office and secretarial skills: learning Word and PowerPoint and Excel."" The Next Gen report's recommendations set out a number of changes, including making computer science an essential discipline in the national curriculum. Inits response to the report, released late last year, the UK government mentioned Raspberry Pi. ""Much as the BBC Micro inspired a generation of computer programmers in the early 1980s, the Raspberry Pi could provide the platform for teachers and pupils to gain hands-on programming experience,"" it stated. Mr Livingstone believes there is an appetite for change. ""I've met with special advisers at No 10,"" he said. ""We've had some pretty significant discussions quite recently. ""I'm very hopeful, but there's a long way between a nodding head and changing the curriculum."" However, Mr Livingstone may not have to wait long to find out the government's plans; further announcements on the teaching of IT in schools are expected in the next couple of days. Back to the future The Raspberry Pi may hope to repeat the success of the BBC Micro, but a Marty McFly style leap back in time to the computer rooms of the 1980s will not meet the IT needs of modern schools. ""Those days are gone,"" said Valerie Thompson, chief executive of the e-Learning Foundation, an educational charity helping schools provide learning technologies. While she's supportive of the Raspberry Pi, she argues that unlike the early 1980s the principal use of computers is not to teach pupils about computing. In her view, students will need access to a ""portfolio of products"" which could include devices like the Pi but will also require others designed primarily to help with school work in other subjects. And it's not just a question of technology. The Next Gen report highlighted a general need for more teachers qualified in computer science. It said: ""Of the 28,767 teachers who were awarded Qualified Teacher Status... in 2010, only three qualified in computing or computing science as their primary qualification (compared with 750 in ICT)."" Like the BBC Micro, the Raspberry Pi will be simple enough for non-specialists to use, but to get the most out of it many teachers will need help. ""It is not 'Will teachers accept it?',"" says Prof Diana Laurillard, chair of learning with digital technologies at the Institute of Education. ""It is: 'Will they be given the professional development opportunity they need to make use of it?' ""It is a question of growing that kind of expertise, it's not half an afternoon's workshop."" App store It is, of course, possible to learn to programme on machines of the sort already used in schools, but Raspberry Pi Foundation trustee Robert Mullins of the Computer Laboratory at Cambridge University thinks the Pi will draw students into learning to code. ""We obviously hope that Raspberry Pi will help attract more people in to having a go,"" he wrote in an email to the BBC. ""The Raspberry Pi is small, credit-card sized, low-cost, low-power and is relatively easy to interface to other devices. ""This will enable it to be used to create powerful robots and mobile gadgets."" Mr Mullins believes that the online community developing around the Raspberry Pi will be important, and that is only possible because of the shared experience of owning one of the devices. ""We will create our own 'app store' type website so people can exchange programs,"" he wrote. The Raspberry Pi team will be turning to early adopters of the machines to help develop software and online resources according to another trustee, David Braben. The co-author, in the 1980s, of the influential space trading game Elite thinks it's important to give pupils access to an inexpensive dedicated device. He said that rather than worry about pupils damaging computers it was better to give them a machine where ""breaking"" the device is part of the learning experience. ""Desktop computers have now got so complicated they're actually quite hard to programme,"" he said. ""What I hope we can do is foster the level of familiarity and understanding that computers in the 1980s did."" The high prices earned at auction show that there are plenty of people who feel passionately about the Raspberry Pi. The success of the project will depend upon sustaining that enthusiasm. Career changer? ""Big curriculum change is hard,"" says Mr Upton. ""In the first instance we're going to be fenced in to quite a geeky corner of the world. ""We are going to require teachers who have, off their own back, developed quite sophisticated computer skills - but obviously that's not the long-term goal,"" he said. Mr Upton anticipates after-school clubs will be in the vanguard of the Pi's integration into the the classroom. Next Gen co-author Mr Livingstone believes that, as in the 1980s, the BBC could have a role in building grass-roots support for the device. ""The BBC should possibly brand this as the BBC Nano, and like they did in the 1980s provide TV programmes that help the teachers and help the students,"" he said. But for the Raspberry Pi team success does not necessarily require change on the scale of the home computing revolution. Eben Upton's concerns about the skill levels of university applicants entering computing provided the inspiration for the project. He thinks even a modest change in the numbers of young people choosing computer science-related careers would justify their work. ""I think 1,000 kids a year would make an enormous difference,"" he said.","A test version of the Raspberry Pi computer has attracted bids of more than £3,000 in a fund-raising auction on eBay. With the machine about to start its first major production run, could it be the right tool to revitalise computer science in schools?"
"By Zoe KleinmanTechnology reporter, BBC News Jio, BSNL and Vodafone are among those to have adopted the move after a request from the government. The message, in English, begins with a person coughing and is heard instead of a ringing tone by the caller. However, several websites have published a way to silence it, after complaints it was becoming annoying. It contains information about the virus and its symptoms, and is heard only by the caller - it is not a default handset ringtone. ""It's been just about a week since we started hearing this ringtone on many calls,"" said Kinjal Pandya-Wagh, a senior journalist in the BBC's Delhi Bureau. ""It has helped people understand a bit more about the symptoms and what to do if they have them."" However, she also said it was creating ""a bit of panic"" among some of those already very anxious about the virus. Its introduction from 9 March had not been accompanied by much media coverage but had ""raised a few eyebrows"", Pandya-Wagh said.

"It is the culmination of an operation to close 143 servers commanding an army of 30 million hijacked computers around the globe. The infected machines formed a huge botnet, giving criminals access to sensitive information. Experts have questioned whether it puts the Dutch police in breach of the law. It is believed to be the first time a police force has used such an approach. ""Technically, what the Dutch police did could be considered to breaking the law in some countries, by making unauthorised changes to another user's computer,"" said Graham Cluley, a senior consultant at security firm Sophos. ""I think it's unlikely that anyone would believe legal action against the police would be appropriate in this circumstance. They're trying to make the best of a bad situation,"" he added. But it may not have convinced everyone. ""Some users may not believe the warning and may think it's one of the commonly seen fake security warnings that tries to trick users into taking a dangerous action,"" he said. The botnet closed down by Dutch police was created using the so-called Bredolab trojan, malicious code which allowed criminals to capture bank details and other sensitive information from infected machines. In a statement the Dutch hi-tech crime squad said that Armenian police had arrested ""the probable mastermind"" behind the Bredolab botnet at Yerevan airport in Armenia. It said that it had decided to let users know their machines were part of the botnet. ""More than 100,000 computer users have been warned that their computers are part of the botnet,"" the statement read. It said had received 55 responses from users whose computers were compromised. Although the decision to use a botnet for innocent purposes might be a first in the police force, it is not the only time a botnet has been taken over. The BBC programme Click took control of over 22,000 home computers last year as part of an investigation into hi-tech crime.",Dutch police have taken the unusual step of tapping into hijacked computers to tell users that their machines had been taken over.
"The Department of Labor has singled out the firm's pledge to double the number of ""black and African American"" senior staff by 2025. Officials have warned the company the target appears ""to imply that the employment action may be taken on the basis of race"". Microsoft denies the accusation. ""We are clear that the law prohibits us from discriminating on the basis of race,"" the firm's lawyer Dev Stahlkopf blogged. ""We also have affirmative obligations as a company that serves the federal government to continue to increase the diversity of our workforce, and we take those obligations very seriously. ""One thing remains true of all our programmes. We hire and promote the most-qualified person. And nothing we announced in June changes that."" Microsoft would provide further information to defend itself soon, he added. The Department of Labor has told Microsoft it has until 29 October to submit relevant evidence. It has informed the tech giant that while companies can set affirmative action goals to boost employment of ""minorities and women"", they ""must not engage in discriminatory practices"" to achieve them. Affirmative action The intervention comes a month after US President Donald Trump ordered federal agencies to stop racial sensitivity training, labelling it ""divisive, anti-American propaganda"". In June, Microsoft said it would increase spending by $150m (£117m) over five years to improve its internal diversity and inclusion efforts. Its plans include:",Microsoft is being questioned by the US government over whether a diversity initiative amounts to racial discrimination.
"In a statement, the White House said more than 5.6 million fingerprint records were stolen from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). An initial investigation suggested only 1.1 million were lost. The OPM acts as the personnel office for the US government and keeps records on 21.5 million federal staff. Identity risk The OPM attack was uncovered in April this year and saw attackers make off with ID and security clearance information about US government staff. Social security numbers, names, addresses, health, financial and biometric data were all taken. Fingerprint records were also stolen and the continuing investigation into the breach has revealed that far more went missing than initially thought. The OPM played down the significance of the fingerprint theft saying that the ability to abuse the data was ""currently limited"". However, it acknowledged that the risk could rise as technology improved and fingerprints were increasingly used as a guarantee of identity. ""An inter-agency working group with expertise in this area ... will review the potential ways adversaries could misuse fingerprint data now and in the future,"" it said in a statement. The FBI, Pentagon and Department of Homeland Security are all part of the task force assessing how losing fingerprint data might affect victims. The OPM said it would soon start a massive project to inform all the people whose data had been stolen. Ken Munro from security firm Pen Test Partners said: ""The biggest concern about biometrics since day one has been revocation. ""It is easy to get a new password, pin or credit card after a breach but it's rather harder to get new fingers."" The announcement about the scale of the hack comes as Chinese President Xi Jinping makes a state visit to the US. Security experts have pointed the finger at China as the source of the attack but it has always denied any involvement. Mr Xi and President Obama are due to talk about cybersecurity when they meet later this week.","Hackers who breached US government networks stole far more fingerprint records than first thought, officials have said."
"It says the Android-powered device will ship to North America in June and be priced at $349 (£229). That makes it $100 more expensive than Sony's PlayStation Vita and nearly double the cost of Nintendo's 3DS XL. One expert said Shield was unlikely to appeal to more than a ""niche audience"" but it would act as a showpiece for Nvidia's technology. The console is equipped with the firm's Tegra 4 chip - its new top-end mobile processor. The ARM-based component features 72 graphic processing unit (GPU) cores and four central processing unit (CPU) cores. Nvidia says this allows it to offer ""rich graphics and unbeatable performance"". The firm is pitching its chip as an alternative to Qualcomm's popular Snapdragon processors, which are used in high-end Android devices such as Samsung's Galaxy S4 and the HTC One. ""The market for handheld consoles is struggling in face of competition from smartphones, so the first question you have to ask yourself is what is the market for a dedicated Android gaming device,"" Ben Parfitt, online editor at games industry trade magazine MCV, told the BBC. ""Even if you believe a market exists, $349 is a lot of money. People aren't spending that at the moment on the Wii U which is a home console, I find it hard to believe they'd spend it on a handheld."" Streaming PC games Shield does offer features not found in either Sony or Nintendo's portable consoles. Its 5in (12.7cm) screen displays 720p high definition video; it has a more powerful speaker system; and its mini-HDMI port can output 4K resolution visuals to compatible televisions. In addition to running titles available from the Google Play and Tegrazone Android marketplaces, it can also stream more advanced titles bought from Valve's Steam platform and run on a wi-fi connected PC. ""These pieces, put together by a company full of gaming fanatics, add up to an amazing new open platform gaming portable,"" Nvidia said on its blog. After a hands-on test, the Techradar news site praised the variety of controls offered by the device, but noted that its 294 pixel per inch (ppi) resolution screen was outclassed by many smartphones. ""That was nothing to sneeze at a few years ago, but now your average smart phone is rocking ppi in the mid-300s,"" it said. ""The new HTC One has 440 ppi."" Mr Parfitt also questioned the appeal of one of its other unique selling points. ""Streaming PC games is something you can't do on rival devices and that is a great feature,"" he said. ""But you have to have a compatible Nvidia graphics card in your PC - one of the reasonably new ones - so that will cut down the audience for that. And do the people who invest in high-end gaming on PCs want a portable as well? I don't know."" Nvidia said Steam would ship with two titles optimised for the handheld: Sega's Sonic 4 Episode II, and Retrobomb's Expendable Rearmed. It added that it had started taking pre-orders from selected customers, and would open up sales to others from 20 May.",US chipmaker Nvidia has revealed its launch plans for Shield - its handheld video-games console.
"By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor The city's IT chief said the service would become operational on Thursday. The move coincides with a separate initiative to help European health authorities create virus-tracing apps that communicate with each other. This could help relax border restrictions. Germany is expected to announce its own app that ties into the scheme shortly. NHSX, which is working on something similar for the UK, has been in communication with those running the project but has yet to commit to interoperability. Location data Moscow was put into an indefinite citywide quarantine on Monday. Its Social Monitoring app will initially be limited to citizens who have already tested positive for Covid-19 but not been kept in hospital. It will request access to the user's calls, location, camera, storage, network information and other data. The intention is to check they do not leave their home while contagious. The local government's IT chief, Eduard Lysenko, said the app was being made available on Google's Play and Apple's iOS stores. He said those affected who did not own a smartphone could borrow one with the software pre-installed, for a fortnight. ""We'd be concerned about the possibility of this app being used to track the movements of millions of people as well proving to be a tool for social control,"" said Privacy International senior researcher Tom Fisher. ""For people to lose faith in the government and health authorities at this time, through being subjected to intrusive and unnecessary surveillance, will only serve to damage efforts to fight this virus."" Mr Lysenko also revealed plans to launch a related scheme for Moscow's wider population, in which residents will request a fresh QR (quick response) code each time they want to leave their home. The square barcodes would be issued via email or an app, he added, to allow people to go out for shopping and dog-walking, among other tasks. Citizens would be obliged to show the police their code if requested, he said. Mid-April apps The pan-European scheme involves about 130 scientists and technologists, who have been working on a way for different countries' coronavirus-tracing apps to link up without weakening privacy protections. Several nations are working on apps that let users enter a unique code if they are found to have the virus. The software will then send an alert to other people they have recently come into close contact with, advising them to go into quarantine or take other protective measures. By doing this, others who are not affected might be able to be released from lockdown. The Pan-European Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (PEPP-PT) initiative aims to deliver a ""multi-country exchange mechanism"". So if someone travels from one European country to another, they can still receive or trigger an alert, even if using a different app to locals. Chris Boos, one of the project's coordinators, said about 90% of the work had already been done and the technology should be ready for release by the end of next week. A few governments had already signed up to take part but had yet to make formal announcements. ""You will see the first applications built on this by 15 April or 19 April - something like that. We're not talking about months, we're talking about a very short time,"" he said. The aim was for more than 60% of each participating country's population to install the software, said his colleague Prof Marcel Salathe, from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne. A third leader, Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute (FHHI) executive director Prof Thomas Wiegand, said Bluetooth signals appeared to be the best way to track when people had come into close proximity to each other. And the resulting records could be stored in an anonymous, encrypted form. ""Even if the data stored in the country data centres is subpoenaed or a hacker steals it, there is no way to trace back the patients or the contact people,"" Mr Boos said. He also promised privacy activists would be invited to inspect the source code for themselves. Germany's De Spiegel newspaper reports the country's federal government will soon confirm its own plans for an app co-developed with the FHHI. The country has some of the toughest privacy laws in the world. The report said use of the tool would be voluntary and a guarantee would be given that all of the data would be deleted soon after the crisis was resolved.","Moscow is launching an app to track the movements of people in the capital diagnosed with coronavirus, who have been ordered to stay at home."
"By Dave LeeTechnology reporter, BBC News Minor political group Pirate Party UK set up a proxy service to the piracy site ahead of its blocking by the High Court in April. Leader Loz Kaye refused the British Phonographic Industry's (BPI) request to shut down the proxy last week. The BPI said court proceedings ""are going to be necessary"". The industry body told the BBC its solicitors will writing to the party in due course. ""Despite our efforts to resolve the matter amicably, it is clear that the Pirate Party are determined to continue providing access to the illegal Pirate Bay site,"" a spokesman said. ""Our solicitors will now be formally writing to the members of the Pirate Party's national executive committee."" In a statement, Mr Kaye said his party was ready to defend itself. ""It is clear that we are facing a significant threat, and we will have to fight it. ""And fight it well, not just for the sake of the Pirate Party, but because of the principles at stake. ""I have always believed that it is not just enough to have principles, you need to act on them too, even if it gets difficult."" Piracy block In April, the High Court ruled that the UK's major internet service providers (ISPs) must block The Pirate Bay, one of the most popular sites listing links to download illegal copyrighted material. The ISPs involved in the action have complied, but internet rights campaigners have voiced criticism of the move, suggesting it was ineffective against piracy and a form of censorship. The Pirate Party UK - not associated with The Pirate Bay - had set up a proxy service which allowed UK internet users to circumvent the block. After the court-ordered ban came into effect its traffic skyrocketed. According to web metrics firm Alexa, the party's site was ranked 1,943 in the UK prior to the Pirate Bay ban. The site is now ranked 147 - higher than the likes of Netflix, the Huffington Post and the NHS. Mr Kaye has previously boasted that it sent more than two million hits to the Pirate Bay every day. On its website, the Pirate Party UK said the BPI was trying to ""kill"" it. The BPI responded: ""We are asking for only the proxy to be removed and for the Pirate Party not to provide any other access to The Pirate Bay.

"It says Russian operatives used social media to deter black people from voting and planted subtly racist content to incite conflict between ethnicities. The report comes two years into the Senate Intelligence Committee's investigation into the 2016 election. Social media firms say they are trying to prevent it from happening again. Thousands of Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and You Tube accounts created by the St. Petersburg-based Internet Research Agency (IRA) were aimed at harming Hillary Clinton's campaign and supporting Donald Trump, the committee concludes. More than 66% of Facebook adverts posted by the Russian troll farm contained a term related to race. African-American community voters were discouraged from voting, and from supporting Hillary Clinton. Posts with the titles ""Our Votes Don't Matter,"" ""Don't Vote for Hillary Clinton"" and ""A Vote for Jill Stein is Not a Wasted Vote"" were specifically targeted at black voters, the report says. How it worked An Oxford study cited in the Senate report captures several pictures of Facebook and Instagram posts which it says were created by the Russian operatives. Oxford's Computational Propaganda Research Project includes pictures of posts which Russian operatives posted on Facebook and Instagram. In these posts, operatives were told to avoid racial slurs but still post racist content, the report says, in order to evade the attention of social media monitors and not have their ads taken down. IRA posts like this one, which pictured the confederate flag and included issues connected with the political argument about gun ownership, were meant to create conflict on social media, the report says. The Senate intelligence report says posts were aimed at making Americans suspicious of one another, and of the US government. Russian ads aimed at African-Americans mimicked social justice movements that were already active in the black community, and tried to create a negative response from other US ethnic groups, the report says. The Black Matters Facebook page, created by Russian operatives, was meant to imitate the Black Lives Matters movement, which campaigned against racism. One of the Black Matters posts, pictured above, advertised a rally for Eric Garner, who was put by police in a chokehold before he died in custody. Daniel Pantaleo, the policeman involved, lost his job but was not criminally charged. Garner's dying words ""I can't breathe"" became a rallying cry for protests against police brutality. Other IRA ads and social media did not contain any political content at all. They were meant to go viral and gain followers. This post by IRA account @blackstagram_ _ used a picture of a prominent social media influencer, Janee Allure. It received 111,102 likes with the hashtags, #blackexcellence and #blackgirlmagic. Another image posted on Instagram featured a young girl in a rainbow dress with hashtags that mentioned community pride and Black History Month. It was shared 168,998 times. Facebook users engaged 11.2 million times with a top-performing page, ""Blacktivist"", which was created by the Russian agency. Almost 100% of its YouTube content involved videos of violence perpetrated against African-American men, says the report. Alleged police brutality against African-Americans featured on Blacktivist video and Instagram posts as well as news stories with racial undertones, like the NFL kneeling protests. How social media has changed Facebook says it has doubled the number of people working on safety and security, and just last month met several government agencies including the FBI, as well as academics, to prevent Russian influence in the 2020 elections. The social media site says it takes down millions of fake accounts a day, and has improved its response results across all of its teams. ""We have stepped up our efforts to build strong defences on multiple fronts...We have also invested in technology and people to block and remove fake accounts; find and remove co-ordinated manipulation campaigns; and bring unprecedented transparency to political advertising."" Facebook said. Google said: ""Videos on YouTube are viewable by anyone. Users can create videos intended for certain audiences, but there is no way to target by race"". Twitter said that it received no information from the US government before the 2016 election about a state-sponsored operation. Since ""discovering the issue,"" a spokeswoman from Twitter said it was working with law enforcement and the FBI as well as the Department of Homeland Security, and had conducted a public investigation into the events of 2016.","A Senate inquiry has concluded that a Russian fake-news campaign targeted ""no single group... more than African-Americans."""
"The consumer group set up a fake company and bought bogus five-star reviews as part of an investigation. In doing so, it was able to tie its sham ""customers"" to dozens of other highly-rated British firms, including a dentist and a stockbroker. Google says it has ""significantly"" invested in tech to tackle the issue. But it and other review sites are in the sightlines of the Competition and Markets Authority, which began examining the sector last year. It has threatened enforcement action against platforms which have fallen short of their responsibilities. Previous research from Which? suggests that nearly half of people who check online reviews of local businesses read them on Google. How did they find them? Which? conducted its research by essentially setting up a ""sting"" operation to catch unscrupulous operators in the act. It created a fake business listing which it called ""five-star reviews"", and searched online for companies advertising paid-for Google reviews. It then spent $150 (£108) on their services. Which? told each company it wanted five-star reviews only, and between three and five of them a day - and the consumer group's researchers wrote the reviews themselves, ""praising how good the made-up business and its fake owner Catherine are"". The fake reviews appeared over the following week, a few at a time. But in investigating the ""reviewers"" behind them, the Which? team found, among others: Which? said it linked some 45 businesses scattered across the country to three suspicious ""reviewers"". That suggested they had each paid the same review seller to post their reviews, it said. Why does it matter? Which? said that some fake reviews could have serious real-world consequences. For example, one claimed that a Liverpool solicitor had helped them recover tens of thousands of pounds. If false, it could scam people in a vulnerable financial position, the group argued. In another, the positive reviews outweighed several presumably genuine negative reviews which warned customers away from allegedly unscrupulous or ""scam"" companies. ""Businesses exploiting flaws in Google's review system to rise up the ranks are putting honest businesses on the back foot and leaving consumers at risk of being misled,"" said Natalie Hitchins from Which?. It called on regulators and Google to take action. When it presented Google with the findings, the fake sting company was immediately deleted, Which? said. Google said that its policies ban fake reviews, and that it monitors the system for fraud around the clock, ""using a combination of people and technology"". ""When we find scammers trying to mislead people, we take swift action ranging from content removal to account suspension and even litigation,"" the company said. Which? did find that one of the fake reviews was removed by Google during the course of its investigation - but the firm it bought from said it would ""slow down"" the rate of fake review posting so future ones would ""stick"". The consumer group also offered the review-selling companies which it had researched the opportunity to say something. Only two replied: one to argue that its services help new businesses to get started and that it was not breaking any Google terms and conditions; and another to deny that it had ever sold any fake reviews and that Which? was mistaken.","Google is failing to do enough to combat fake reviews within its business listings, and must be held to account by a UK watchdog, according to Which?"

Cambridge Analytica closed down operations in May. ""This ad was not created by Cambridge Analytica,"" a Facebook spokesman said. ""It is fake, violates our policies and has been taken down. ""We believe people on Facebook should know who is behind the political ads they're seeing, which is why we are creating the Ads Library so that you can see who is accountable for any political ad.

Jim Edwards, editor-in-chief of Business Insider UK said, ""We hope our story will push Facebook into making its advertising system more secure and less open to abuse."" The ad was spotted by Guardian and Observer journalist Carole Cadwalladr. ""It just highlights how completely useless Facebook's new transparency rules are,"" she told the BBC. ""I can't think how they ever thought they were going to work - anybody can write anything in that box."" Tougher rules? From 16 October, Facebook's new rules for political ads in the UK came into effect. The social network had claimed that creators of such ads would have to prove their identity and location. However, the resilience of Facebook's system has been called into question. News site Vice was able to post ads purporting to be paid for by every sitting US senator, a total of 100 individuals. ""Receiving approval to run an ad 'paid for' by a senator typically just took a few minutes,"" said Vice journalist William Turton. The fake ad comes as the UK and Canadian parliaments join forces to demand that Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg respond to MP's questions over the Cambridge Analytica scandal. A hearing will be held by the UK House of Commons digital, culture, media and sport committee on 27 November. In a joint letter, the organisers appealed to Mr Zuckerberg to make an appearance. ""We would have thought that this responsibility is something that you would want to take up,"" wrote chair of the House of Commons committee Damian Collins and Bob Zimmer, chair of the Canadian standing committee on access to information, privacy and ethics.",A fake advert purporting to have been paid for by scandal-hit Cambridge Analytica has been posted to Facebook.
"The drones, called Octocopters, could deliver packages weighing up to 2.3kg to customers within 30 minutes of them placing the order, he said. However, he added that it could take up to five years for the service to start. The US Federal Aviation Administration is yet to approve the use of unmanned drones for civilian purposes. ""I know this looks like science fiction, but it's not,"" Mr Bezos told CBS television's 60 Minutes programme. ""We can do half-hour delivery... and we can carry objects, we think, up to five pounds (2.3kg), which covers 86% of the items that we deliver."" 'Ready to enter' The service will be called Prime Air and comes as Amazon is looking to improve its efficiency to boost growth. Amazon also posted a video on its website showing a drone picking up a package from one of its warehouses and delivering it to the doorstep of a customer's house. However, it still has to wait for permission from US regulators. The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has approved the use of drones for police and government agencies, issuing about 1,400 permits over the past several years. Civilian air space is expected to be opened up to all kinds of drones in the US by 2015 and in Europe by 2016. Existing regulations are in place to minimise the risk of injury to people on the ground, said Dr Darren Ansell, an expert on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) from the University of Central Lancashire. ""The UAVs do not currently have the awareness of their environment to be able to avoid flying into people. To deliver goods to people's homes for example in residential areas, the UAVs must overfly densely populated towns and cities, something that today's regulations prevent. ""Other things to consider are security of the goods during the transit. With no one to guard them the aircraft and package could be captured and stolen,"" he said. Amazon said: ""from a technology point of view, we'll be ready to enter commercial operations as soon as the necessary regulations are in place."" The FAA was ""actively working on rules for unmanned aerial vehicles"", the company said, adding that it hoped the green light would be given as early as 2015. ""One day, Prime Air vehicles will be as normal as seeing mail trucks on the road today."" Zookal, an Australian textbook rental company, announced earlier this year that it would start using drones to make deliveries from 2015 if approved by Australia's Civil Aviation Safety Authority. Australian law allows the use of unmanned aircraft for commercial use.","Amazon, the world's largest online retailer, is testing unmanned drones to deliver goods to customers, chief executive Jeff Bezos has said."
"Prosecutors had had 45 days to make the application following Kim Dotcom's arrest in January. The papers also call for the extradition of three other senior members of Megaupload's staff. The men are accused of helping make it possible for users to illegally download copyrighted material through their file-sharing site. The accused deny criminal misconduct. New Zealand court officials said the papers were filed on Friday. An extradition hearing has been scheduled for 20 August. The US has accused Megaupload's staff of racketeering, copyright infringement, money laundering and wire fraud among other charges. Prosecutors allege that the website cost copyright holders more than $500m (£320m; 380 euros) in lost revenue. However, Mr Dotcom has described the scale of the claim as ""nonsense"", tellingNew Zealand's Channel 3 Newsthat: ""I'm no piracy king, I offered online storage and bandwidth to users and that's it."" Mr Dotcom - a German national - was released on bail 12 days ago despite protests by the US that he posed an extreme flight risk. However, a judge ruled that an electronic monitoring bracelet that he has to wear and the fact that his assets had been seized had reduced that risk. Pending the hearing to determine if he should be sent to stand trial in the US, Mr Dotcom has been forbidden to use the internet and has been ordered to remain within the grounds of his leased Auckland estate.",A formal request for the extradition of Megaupload's founder has been filed in New Zealand by the US government.
"Frank GardnerSecurity correspondent That's how Jamie Bartlett, author of The Dark Net, sums up the constantly evolving battle in cyberspace between terrorists and the intelligence agencies trying to discover their hidden communications. ""The unbelievable growth in widely available (encryption) software will make their job much harder,"" he said. ""What it will mean is a shift away from large-scale traffic network analysis to almost old-fashioned intelligence work to infiltrate groups - more and people on the ground as opposed to someone on a computer in Cheltenham."" Hidden signals Where do you go if you want to communicate in secret without being intercepted and eavesdropped on? In the Second World War there was Enigma, the German cipher machine eventually decoded by Britain. There was also steganography, the art of shrinking and concealing information inside objects such as microdots, usually only detectable by those who knew exactly where to look. In Cold War days spies sat next to each other on park benches or left secret messages to be picked up later in ""dead letter drops"" behind objects such as flowerpots or in crevices in walls. In the 1990s extremist groups used satellite phones and faxes to communicate, with paper messages from Osama Bin Laden in Afghanistan churning out of a fax machine operated in North London by his UK representative. Already that sounds almost prehistoric. For close to two decades now the internet has been the river through which most terrorist communications flow, hiding amongst the legitimate, the ordinary, the innocuous or the just conventionally criminal. So how, I asked Sir David Omand, the former Director of Britain's GCHQ spy agency, do they conceal them? ""They have a wide range of options and... they can hide in the sheer volume of the internet,"" said Sir David. ""There is an enormous variety of applications that ride on the internet that can be used to communicate, including games. You can hide in and communicate in a multiplayer game."" Staying anonymous Increasingly, terrorists as well as law-abiding citizens are using ways of staying anonymous online, with two of the most popular tools being virtual private networks (VPNs) and Tor, popularly known as ""the dark web"" or ""the dark net"". ""The dark net, the part of the internet that requires anonymisation software, is probably where they go to share their videos, the ghastly beheading videos,"" said Sir David. ""So that they can do that anonymously and can't be traced back and then, when they're ready, they can upload that kind of video material to the open internet so that media can then pick it up."" Tor, aka ""The Onion Router"" is free software that allows users to browse online without revealing either their identity (through their IP address) or their location by rerouting their messages through confusing layers. It now has over 2.5 million daily users, of which only a tiny fraction are likely to be engaged in terrorism. Since the former CIA employee Edward Snowden fled to Russia in 2013 and revealed how western intelligence agencies are engaged in wide-scale surveillance, more and more ordinary citizens are turning to easily available encryption tools. Put simply, they don't want somebody else reading their messages. But with volumes like that, it is becoming easier for organised criminals, paedophiles and terrorists to hide amongst the crowd. ""One thing we do know is that terrorists are using the Tor browser, an anonymous browser that allows its users to not give away their IP address, and we know they use various types of secure communications, encrypted messages etc, essentially anything they can find that will make it harder for the authorities to monitor,"" said Mr Bartlett. In practice, this means that a jihadist from IS in Raqqa, in northern Syria, for example, can use a VPN or Tor to appear to be communicating online from a completely different part of the world. Many of IS's followers are acutely aware they are at risk of being monitored and the group's more technologically savvy members post advice online on how to avoid detection. ""They share practical advice,"" said Mr Bartlett. ""They say download Tor and don't put personal details on social media. Make sure you are using Tails - an operating system that makes it hard to know what is being downloaded onto a computer."" Benign uses There is, of course, another side to all this. Software encryption and rerouting that can help conceal terrorist communications also works for journalists, civil rights and democracy activists under threat of censorship or imprisonment. ""Tor is absolutely essential in countries like China, Iran and Saudi Arabia where the network is censored or controlled, said Gregoire Pouget, head of new media at the advocacy group Reporters Without Borders. ""In order to evade censorship we explain to journalists how to use it. We even have an agreement with Tor."" The dark web sounds sinister and it certainly does hide a multitude of very dark dealings. But the sheer volume of ordinary people now using it as a matter of course have inevitably pulled it closer into the mainstream of digital communications. The more people who use it, the easier, in theory, it will be for terrorists to hide their own messages amongst its terabytes of data. But the dark web does have benign uses and while it presents a growing challenge to counter-terrorism authorities this is a phenomenon that is unlikely to disappear anytime soon.","It's a technological arms race, pure and simple."
"By Chris FoxTechnology reporter Many customers have long suspected that Apple slows down older iPhones to encourage people to upgrade. The company has now said it does slow down some models as they age, but only because the phones' battery performance diminishes over time. Apple said it wanted to ""prolong the life"" of customers' devices. The practice was confirmed after a customer shared performance tests on Reddit, suggesting their iPhone 6S had slowed down considerably as it had aged but had suddenly sped up again after the battery had been replaced. ""I used my brother's iPhone 6 Plus, and his was faster than mine? This is when I knew something was wrong,"" wrote TeckFire. Technology website Geekbench then analysed several iPhones running different versions of the iOS operating system and found some of them did indeed appear to have been deliberately slowed down. What was Apple's response? Apple has now confirmed that it made changes to iOS to manage ageing lithium-ion batteries in some devices, since the batteries' performance diminishes over time. ""Lithium-ion batteries become less capable of supplying peak current demands when in cold conditions, [when they] have a low battery charge or as they age over time, which can result in the device unexpectedly shutting down to protect its electronic components,"" the company said. ""Last year, we released a feature for iPhone 6, iPhone 6s and iPhone SE to smooth out the instantaneous peaks only when needed to prevent the device from unexpectedly shutting down during these conditions. ""We've now extended that feature to iPhone 7 with iOS 11.2, and plan to add support for other products in the future. ""Our goal is to deliver the best experience for customers."" Why do lithium-ion batteries degrade? Lithium batteries degrade over time because of what happens during the charging and discharging cycle. During both those events, lithium ions migrate through the material forming the battery. Studies using electron microscopes have shown that each time the ions do this they make tiny changes to the physical structure of that electrolyte. The effect is like ""rust creeping unevenly across steel"", according to one scientist who has studied the phenomenon. The changes effectively erode the material so it can hold less of a charge and can hamper its ability to provide a steady power supply. Higher voltages make the erosion happen more quickly, as do higher temperatures. Should Apple have told customers? ""By choosing to implement this quietly, it appears more nefarious than it really is. That doesn't engender trust,"" wrote developer and blogger Nick Heer. ""Apple has long been very good about managing expectations… this is an instance where they blew it. Needlessly, I think."" Replacing an old battery in one of the affected models should return the phone to its former speed. Doing so costs £79 in the UK and $79 (£59) in the US. ""They should be more transparent about it,"" said Chris Green from the tech consultancy Bright Bee. ""You're taking away performance that somebody has paid for. If you're going to slow down the phone over time, you should explain why it is happening, so people understand it is ultimately for their benefit. ""But I do see where they're coming from. By slowing the phone, it does help mitigate the problem of the diminishing battery."" You might also be interested in: Analysis by Rory Cellan-Jones, technology correspondent It is a combination of urban myth and conspiracy theory - the idea that Apple builds planned obsolescence into the iPhone, slowing down older models to make you splash out on an upgrade. Now it turns out to be true - the slowing down part, if not the motive behind it. Apple's explanation that it is all about managing the performance of ageing batteries seems quite reasonable. After all, the fact that the lithium-ion batteries that power mobile phones degrade over time is well known and owners of other leading smartphones also complain of poor battery life after a few years. But what will frustrate and anger many iPhone users is Apple's lack of transparency. The software tweak at the heart of this story happened last year and rumours about the deliberate downgrading of performance have been bubbling for weeks. But it was only a couple of days after a software developer showed exactly what was happening that Apple finally came out and explained. Here is a company that is - as any journalist can attest - fanatical about controlling the message about its products. It has also benefitted from the devotion over the years of customers who are more like fans. But maybe it is time for Apple to show a bit more honesty in that relationship.",Apple has confirmed the suspicions of many iPhone owners by revealing it does deliberately slow down some models of the iPhone as they age.
"Dave LeeNorth America technology reporter The new business, Waymo, will be owned by Google’s parent company, Alphabet. It signals a push to commercialise the technology which Google has been developing for more than 10 years. At a media event, the company showed the story of a blind man who was able to make a full trip using a prototype self-driving car. The trip happened in 2015, but the company spoke about it for the first time on Tuesday. ""Steve Mahan rode alone in one of our prototype vehicles, cruising through Austin’s suburbs,” wrote Google’s John Krafcik. ""Steve is legally blind, so our sensors and software were his chauffeur."" Speaking about the formation of the new company, Mr Krafcik said: ""We believe that this technology can begin to reshape some of the ten trillion miles that motor vehicles travel around the world every year, with safer, more efficient and more accessible forms of transport."" Mr Krafcik will become Waymo’s chief executive. Making money The company said it will try to apply the technology behind self-driving vehicles to other purposes. This suggests increased urgency in finding immediate commercial uses for the technology which, so far, has only been used by Google in tests. While other companies, most notably electric car maker Tesla, have managed to roll out elements of self-driving technology to real roads, Google has been taking a far more cautious approach. The Waymo announcement could suggest that Google will deviate from its original goal of only offering 100% self-driving vehicles. ""We can see our technology being useful in personal vehicles, ride-sharing, logistics, or solving 'last mile' problems for public transport,” Mr Krafcik said. The company did not respond to reports that it was abandoning making its own car in favour of working with other, perhaps more established, carmakers. Doing so would be a quick and easy cost-cutting measure at a time when Alphabet is trying to rein in the costs of its so-called ""other bets"" - parts of its business that are seen to be highly innovative but which so far are not making money. Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC and on Facebook","Google is putting its self-driving car technology into a new company which it will call Waymo, the firm has announced."
"By Cristina CriddleTechnology reporter Adverts show how the apps can be used to alter body parts, including making waists slimmer and adding muscles. Eating disorder charities have said technology firms should consider the impact on vulnerable people. The platforms said the apps did not break advertising guidance, but TikTok added it does reviews its policies. It said it is “continually looking to enhance” its framework to “support a body-positive environment”. The social media platform, popular with teenagers, banned adverts for fasting apps and weight loss supplements last year. ‘Fuel this epidemic’ Social media companies need to be held to account and “stop this unhealthy and unhelpful messaging,” said eating disorder campaigner Hope Virgo. ""Over the last year, we have seen a huge increase in the number of people with eating disorders, and while eating disorders aren't necessarily caused by bad body image, we know there are some intrinsic links. “The fact that Instagram and TikTok are currently advertising body-changing apps will fuel this epidemic of eating disorders further.” Eating disorder charity Seed said it has seen a 68% rise in children and teenagers aged between 10 and 19 seeking support since the pandemic. Danae Mercer is a health journalist with a history of disordered eating. She regularly posts about body positivity on Instagram and Tiktok, filming “behind the curtain” videos of how bodies are edited. “I know from my own experience, these apps can be triggering,"" she told the BBC. “The apps make me thinner and curvier than my body, even if I trained all the time, could ever be. They eliminate my pores in a way that’s not even possible in nature. They create a ‘me’ that is, quite simply, unachievable - and they do it all with a click of a button. “The impact of technology like this is immense, and honestly I don’t think we’ll see the full result of it for years” She said it was concerning these apps were being “targeted at particularly vulnerable teens.” “Teens and young girls don’t understand these things yet, not fully. In the same way, we wouldn’t allow weight loss products to be marketed at children, we need to really push for new regulation around what apps are allowed to target vulnerable audiences. Especially when those apps edit bodies.” There are several free apps available on both Apple and Android app stores that allow for convincing body enhancements. Users can edit photos or videos, changing the size and shape of bodies and faces, smoothing skin and enhancing muscles. ‘Duty of care’ “We are spending more time on these platforms than ever,” said Gemma Oaten, manager of Seed. “As we get back to normal life, we won’t be able to hide behind screens or apps. ""People are being offered ways to distort their image online but that puts pressure on them in the real world.” Social media companies should accept a “duty of care” and signpost any adverts which could be detrimental to body image, she added. Beat, a UK eating disorder charity, said “body-changing apps that encourage the stigmatisation of weight, or promote the idealisation of thinness, could cause distress for people suffering from an eating disorder or vulnerable to one"". Its director of external affairs, Tom Quinn, said: “We urge the makers of these apps to consider the impact their portrayals have on vulnerable people. “We would also encourage anyone struggling to report triggering content wherever possible, but also consider taking a step away and instead focusing on other positive sources of support like Beat.”","Body-editing apps advertised on social media platforms TikTok and Instagram are “triggering” young people with eating disorders, campaigners fear."
"The technology, called Sure View, darkens the picture by ""up to 95%"" when observed from wide angles. HP said the laptop can ensure privacy when used in public spaces. One analyst said it could appeal to security-conscious enterprise customers. Numerous peripherals companies already manufacture attachable glue-on screen filters that achieve the same effect, but HP claims its Sure View technology is the world's first ""integrated"" privacy screen. It will launch with two new 14-inch laptops. Pressing the F2 key enables the privacy mode, which HP said can reduce ""up to 95% of visible light when viewed at an angle"". HP said the technology is becoming more of a necessity because of ""visual hacking"", a term it uses for infiltrating accounts by spying on people using their laptops and smartphones. 'Nothing new' Chris Green, a technology analyst for communications agency Lewis, played down the impact of HP's technology. ""Angled screen view protectors are nothing new, they have been around 30 years,"" he said. He added that while over-the-shoulder hacking is a security issue ""it's not something that the industry is measuring with any research"". But Patrick Moorhead, a principal analyst for Moor Insights & Strategy, said that integrating the filter made the tech more dependable for enterprise customers. ""With the glue-on filters, IT departments don't actually know if you are using them. They may think they are managing security but they don't know for sure if that filter is on. ""So to me this lowers the risk, because IT departments can program the laptops so that the filter is always on."" Moorhead said the tech would be particularly useful ""in environments of high security and high privacy such as healthcare, government, and even consultancy firms"". He added that, while there is little research to measure the prevalence of visual hacking ""anecdotally I think it happens a lot"". Research conducted by the Ponemon Institute in Michigan claimed that nine out of 10 attempts to acquire sensitive business information using only visual means were successful. Privacy firm 3M, which developed the Sure View technology for HP, funded Ponemon Institute's research.","Computer firm HP has developed two new laptops that feature an optional privacy mode, which obscures the screen unless viewed face-on."
"By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter Technology and clothing are the hardy perennials of any good Christmas list but how about if you could combine them together? The BBC has turned Santa and selected a few of the wackiest technology and fashion combos. Sadly not all will be available for this Christmas but it is never too early to start planning for next year. RFID Socks It doesn't get more traditional - some would say, boring - than socks for Christmas. My partner may well have 40 identical pairs of black socks, accumulated from Christmasses dating back to the early 1990s. This year his mum might be persuaded to upgrade him to pair of RFID (radio frequency identification) tagged Smarter Socks. The Swedish company behind them hopes to solve the perennial problem of odd socks. Founder Samy Liechti describes them ""as something the sock world has never seen before"". Critics may argue that they are a little over-engineered. Each sock comes with its own RFID chip, which can be ""read"" by a NFC (near field communication) device known as a sock sorter, which in turn communicates via Bluetooth with an iPhone. As each pair has its own unique identifier, finding a lost pair amongst a pile of identical socks is as easier as scanning them with the sock sorter, and waiting until the iPhone app beeps to tell you it has located the exact match. ""Some cynical women may say it is the only way men can sort their socks,"" says Mr Liechti. For those who really want to keep track of their socks, the app also produces a range of data - checking how black they are, offering to replace worn-out socks and even finding a close match for socks whose partners have gone astray. Smarter Socks which comes with one Sock Sorter and ten pairs of socks, is priced at £119. GPS Shoes No Christmas would be complete without one member of the family overdoing it on the sherry and falling asleep with their party hat at a jaunty angle. To ensure they make it home at the end of the day, how about a pair of homing shoes? English shoemaker Dominic Wilcox took his inspiration from The Wizard of Oz, for his ""No Place like Home"" shoes. Just as main character Dorothy finds her way home by clicking the heels of her red slippers, the surprisingly stylish shoes are also able to guide the wearer home. They have a GPS reader embedded in the left heel. Wearers need to plug their destination into a computer program, then upload it to the shoe using a USB cable. When out and about they just need to click their heels three times to set off internal sensors to turn on the device. An antenna disguised in a strip of fabric on the back of the shoe will connect it to GPS signals. The shoes were shown at the recent London Design Festival and Northampton's shoe museum before going off to Wired magazines annual technology exhibition/shop. ""I set out to create some shoes that I would like to wear myself, they seem to have caught the imagination of people so there may be a possibility of production in the future,"" Mr Wilcox tells the BBC. Facebook T-shirt Everyone has a younger member of their family who seems to be surgically attached to their phone, checking Facebook every three seconds. So how about if they could wear their status updates on a T-shirt? The T-shirt OS started life as a promotional collaboration between whisky maker Ballantines and fashion firm Cute Circuit, which has been designing wearable technology since 2006. Wearers can upload pictures and Twitter feeds, as well as listen to music via the shirt. An Android version will come later. It is, says creative director Francesca Rosella essentially a T-shirt version of an iPhone and will, when it goes on sale next year, it likely to cost at least as much as the smartphone. The company has also made a Twitter dress, worn by pop star and X-Factor judge Nicole Scherzinger. As with the T-shirt it also offered a wearable billboard for tweets and at the launch of EE's 4G network fans were able to tweet Ms Scherzinger, and then read their messages on her dress. It is slightly more glamorous than the T-shirt, encrusted with thousands of Swarovski crystals and is currently a one-off design. Next year CuteCircuit is also due to launch its Hug Shirt, which is essentially a T-shirt fitted with sensors, allowing someone wearing an identical garment miles away to send a hug that can be felt by the wearer. Virtual tape measure Ok so this is not strictly clothing and as software it might be a little hard to wrap but it could still prove a thoughtful gift. Most people who have bought clothes online have experienced the frustration of them arriving and not fitting and the subsequent annoyance of having to send things back. So how about a virtual tape measure that can take accurate measurements to ensure that doesn't happen? The web-based system takes detailed measurements of the waist, hip, chest and other measurements and advises the user on which size garment to buy whenever they visit the website of a participating retailer. With funding from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), the software is currently being developed by London College of Fashion and computer vision experts at the University of Surrey, in collaboration with body-mapping specialists Bodymetrics and digital creative agency Guided. They anticipate a launch within two years.","This Christmas Day, smartphones, tablets and e-readers will vie with the more traditional (and squashier) gifts of socks and jumpers under Christmas trees around the country."
"By Chris BaraniukTechnology reporter The US Air Force said that removing a satellite from service had caused a software error. A BBC spokesman confirmed that the decommissioning of a GPS satellite led to difficulties for listeners receiving digital radio signals. The BBC understands several other satellites were affected. ""I live on the Worksop side of Sheffield and for the past two days the reception of the BBC National Ensemble [BBC radio stations] has been virtually non-existent indoors,"" wrote Darcy72 on Digital Spy's online forums last week. In a response to the reported issues, the BBC said: ""The outages were caused by a rogue GPS satellite (SVN23), which was taken out of service in the evening of 26 January."" The BBC has now learned that the problem occurred after a decommissioned satellite caused software problems which affected several other satellites. DAB transmitters must broadcast at exactly the same frequencies and, in order to synchronise, they lock on to GPS satellite signals. The GPS signals themselves broadcast the time and are supposed to be accurate to within a few nanoseconds. 'Microseconds' error However, on 26 January, one of the GPS satellites - named SVN23 - orbiting the Earth was decommissioned. This unexpectedly caused problems for the whole network. ""While the core navigation systems were working normally, the co-ordinated universal time timing signal was off by 13 microseconds which exceeded the design specifications,"" said the US Air Force in a statement. ""The issue was resolved at 06:10 MST, however global users may have experienced GPS timing issues for several hours."" In fact, as a result of the problem, some GPS positioning would have been thrown off by nearly 4km. The time discrepancy was picked up by the Metsahovi Radio Observatory in Finland. It is not yet clear whether other systems around the world, such as navigational tools, were affected. The BBC is still chasing the US Air Force for further details about the incident. ""They knew they were decommissioning it so shouldn't they have been aware this would happen?"" questioned Prof Danielle George, a radio engineer at the University of Manchester. ""It was decommissioned after 25 years - actually it should have just had a seven-and-a-half-year lifespan so it lasted a lot longer than it should have done."" Depending on GPS Prof George added that had there only been a problem with one satellite, DAB transmitters would probably not have experienced difficulties. ""They shouldn't have seen an issue with that because as far as I understand the way they work is they need two frequencies to lock and there are a number of GPS [signals] to look at,"" she told the BBC. ""This should be treated as a warning of what could go wrong,"" said Martyn Thomas, a fellow at the Royal Academy of Engineering who has criticised technological reliance on GPS. ""The world is dependent on GPS for a vast range of critical applications from navigation to financial trading, and precision docking of oil tankers to high tech farming."" In the future, Prof Thomas said, it was ""essential"" that there was back-up.",An error with the Global Positioning System (GPS) network has been blamed for causing problems with digital radio broadcasts last week.
"Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent@BBCRoryCJon Twitter Everything Everywhere (EE) - that's T-Mobile and Orange to normal people who haven't spent millions on an outlandish new brand - has summoned journalists to the museum in an invitation which gives little away. ""Please join us for exciting information on our new brand and the latest innovation in network technology,"" the company says. The latest innovation is obviously 4G. After all, 11 September is the day from which Ofcom has allowed EE to use some of its existing spectrum for a fourth generation network, a move which has infuriated rival operators. But another new brand? Perhaps it will be Something, Somewhere, because it isn't clear at this stage exactly what kind of 4G service will be provided to customers and in which parts of the country. Still, I'm now hearing rumours that the event will provide news that could really shake up the mobile landscape. We had thought that EE's 4G might not be up and running until the end of the year, and then only for people using broadband dongles. But a source tells me that the company will announce deals that will see four or five devices available very soon to consumers wanting to go 4G. On Saturday the Financial Times reported that Nokia was in talks with Everything Everywhere to make the network the exclusive launch partner for the new Lumia phones it launched in New York last week. I understand that the two Nokia phones will be among those announced for the network's 4G service on Tuesday. If that is indeed the case, then it will be good for both partners. Nokia, which made little or no mention of 4G and said nothing about network deals at its New York event last week, was obviously keeping its powder dry. Now it could have a great launchpad for the Lumia 920 and 820, combining with Everything Everywhere to advertise them as the UK's first 4G phones. The 920, which already looked a very attractive product in the brief moments I had my hands on it last week, will have something to make it stand out from the crowd - in the UK at least. For Everything Everywhere, whose 4G network may now have a year's start on its rivals, there is the opportunity to get people experiencing faster speeds and new services with a manufacturer which will be very keen to cooperate. But there are a couple of shadows looming over the Everything Everywhere event. The fact that it is being held the day before Apple's launch suggests either that the network does not have a deal to sell the new iPhone, or that the device will not be compatible with its particular brand of 4G. One imagines that EE's executives were desperate to offer Apple just about any deal, in order to be the only operator offering a 4G iPhone in the UK, but it now seems unlikely that will happen. Of course, if it does, then Nokia's phone will look much less attractive. The other shadow is the one that has darkened the outlook for 4G in this country for years, the threat of legal action. Ever since Ofcom announced its ruling allowing Everything Everywhere to go ahead with its early 4G plan, Vodafone and O2 have been muttering darkly about doing something to stop it. Both know that any legal move which stopped consumers getting a service already available in many parts of the world would make them look bad. But if the service unveiled on Tuesday looks like a real threat to their profits and market share, they may decide that they cannot afford not to unleash their lawyers. A fascinating week ahead then in the chess game which is the UK's mobile phone market - we will try to keep you abreast of all the latest moves.","It's the biggest week of the year in the mobile phone world, with Apple launching its new iPhone in California on Wednesday. But for some industry watchers - at least in Britain - an event the day before in London looks even more important because at the Science Museum on Tuesday we will begin to see the shape of 4G Britain."
"But Mark Litchfield opened one such a message and it led him on a journey that, so far, has netted him about $1.5m (£1.15m) - all of it legitimate. The email was from one-time web giant Yahoo, now owned by Verizon Media, and offered Mr Litchfield several thousand dollars as a reward for finding a bug in its website code. The email was a surprise because he had pretty much forgotten about finding the bug. ""I submitted a bug to Yahoo and thought that was the end of it,"" he told BBC News. ""And then I got this email saying, 'Hey, we've got some money for you. Do you want it?'"" ""That's when I realised that there was money to be made in this."" Yahoo, like a growing number of large companies, pays up when people find loopholes in its web code that could be exploited by malicious hackers. Through bitter experience, Yahoo has learned what happens when bugs are missed. In 2013 and 2014, it suffered two massive breaches. Data on more than one billion users went astray. It stepped up its bug-hunting efforts in the wake of those breaches - which is where Mr Litchfield and others like him come in. Those ethical hackers sign up with companies such as Hacker One, Bug Crowd, Synack and others who run the bug bounty programmes on behalf of companies. And, according to Mr Litchfield, anyone can do it. ""I can't code - at all,"" he said. ""Yet I've managed to be extremely successful, so literally anyone could do this."" Well, maybe. Mr Litchfield may not code but he has other technical skills. He turned to bug hunting after years of working in the security industry, where he became an expert on the protocols that govern how computers swap data. Finding bugs in the way data is transported has netted him the bumper payouts. Catching the bug For anyone looking to blaze a similar million-dollar trail or even just start a career in cyber-security, knowing that Mr Litchfield has decades of experience to call on can be disheartening. It was a feeling familiar to anyone looking to break into the security industry, said James Lyne, head of research at the Sans Institute. The gap between the experts and the beginners could seem too vast to cross, he said. For a long time, it had been only those lucky enough to discover a real affinity for cyber-security work, who persevered and would hunt for bugs even if they were not getting paid to do it, who found a place in the industry, he said. That was Mr Lyne's experience and is one common among the pros, many of whom have an ""origin"" story of how they accidentally, or with the help of a mentor, made it. ""I was one of the people that lucked out and learned in the industry,"" he said. There was a growing need for that haphazard selection process to change, said Mr Lyne, given the massive skill shortage in the cyber-security industry. ""You need to find a way for someone who does not know they love it to connect with it,"" he said. Many governments, including the UK's, have set up educational schemes that try to give schoolchildren a taste of cyber-security to see if they like it. Mr Lyne helped create the UK's scheme, Cyber Discovery, which in its first year had more than 25,000 school children take part. ""It's a teaching tool and a sorting hat,"" said Mr Lyne. The Cyber Discovery programme ""gamifies"" the day-to-day work of the pros. It turns finding security loopholes, tracking hackers, analysing documents for clues and other basic skills into engaging games. It also gets children familiar with the tools many cyber-pros use day-to-day. Participants get points when they complete a section. And the top performers get to attend residential courses that help them hone their skills further. Bug bounties, said Mr Lyne, were another way that keen amateurs could take their first steps into a cyber-career. ""It's an easier in to the industry and a way to prove your skills,"" he said. Bigger bugs Ian Glover, head of the Crest organisation, which certifies the skills of ethical security testers in the UK, is a supporter of bug bounties too - again as a way for people to get a glimpse of what it is like to defend networks and defeat bad guys for a living. ""The money side of it is not as much of a motivation as you might imagine,"" he told BBC News - while a few people made a lot of money, most did not. ""It's more about trying to solve the challenges, getting into the industry and getting recognition by your peers."" But anyone taking part in a bug bounty hunt should realise the job of a cyber-security worker demanded far more in terms of skill and expertise,"" Mr Glover said. And companies should have a whole host of other well administered defences in place long before they think about letting bounty hunters have a sniff. Alongside defences embedded in networks and threat-analysis teams should go exercises such as penetration tests that do a more in-depth job of ensuring a system is broadly proof against attack. ""Bounties should be the end of the process, not the beginning,"" Mr Glover said.","These days, when an unexpected email turns up offering lots of cash, most people just assume it is a scam and delete it."
"Dave LeeNorth America technology reporter Hm. Elon Musk is a man known and admired for his outlandish plans for our technological future. But even by his standards, Thursday's “announcement” (and I’m loath to call it that) was a real whopper. Tweet one: ""Just received verbal govt approval for The Boring Company to build an underground NY-Phil-Balt-DC Hyperloop. NY-DC in 29 mins.” Tweet two: ""City center to city center in each case, with up to a dozen or more entry/exit elevators in each city.” Tweet three: ""Still a lot of work needed to receive formal approval, but am optimistic that will occur rapidly.” When pressed for more (read: any) information on the deal, neither Tesla nor The Boring Company - a new tunnel-digging company launched by Mr Musk in late 2016 - wanted to share any added substance. But a spokesman for The Boring Company did say that it intends to break ground on the project this year. ""The Boring Company has had a number of promising conversations with local, state and federal government officials,” the company told the BBC. ""With a few exceptions, feedback has been very positive and we have received verbal support from key government decision-makers for tunnelling plans, including a Hyperloop route from New York to Washington DC. ""We look forward to future conversations with the cities and states along this route and we expect to secure the formal approvals necessary to break ground later this year.” Hugely ambitious - and to be clear, the company confirmed to me it does expect to start digging before the end of 2017, not just have approval. 'Promising conversations' We've been trying to track down whom exactly Mr Musk might have been talking to about this. I won’t keep you in suspense: we failed. Firstly, it is not clear where this “verbal government approval” could possibly have come from, given that no government entity - even if it were the president himself - could make such an assurance given the complexity of laying out such a plan. One suggestion was that the handshake came via the Office of American Innovation (OAI)- a new White House department run by President Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner. He has expressed interest in the project, but when asked by the BBC on Thursday, a spokeswoman for the OAI would not confirm any “verbal approval” had been given. She said the White House has had ""promising conversations to date” with Mr Musk and was ""committed to transformative infrastructure projects, and believe our greatest solutions have often come from the ingenuity and drive of the private sector”. But that’s it. Maybe, then, Mr Musk had been setting about getting more localised buy-in for the idea. But of the transport authorities that responded to the BBC’s requests on Thursday, none had the faintest idea what was going on. ""Were asking around to see if anyone at SEPTA knows more about this, but so far have not come up with anything,” said a spokesperson for the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, which covers Philadelphia, one of the cities on the planned hyperloop route. Pennsylvania's governor Tom Wolf was also in the dark - though we're told he's keen to know more about the idea. And in New York City: ""The New York State Department of Transportation did not give verbal approval for a hyperloop,” a spokesperson told the BBC. Suffice it to say, Mr Musk’s promise of “rapid” formal approval seems way, way off the mark. It takes a committee to move a lamppost in America, let alone a multi-tunnel transport ecosystem that would be the most ambitious infrastructure the US will have seen since it began building freeways way back in the 1930s. There was a video doing the rounds on social media recently showing Elon Musk being interviewed by CBS in 2014. In it, he tears up as he’s told, by some of his personal heroes, that his vision for space travel is bogus. Others said his electric car business was going nowhere. He’s made huge leaps in proving them wrong. But on this it’s hard to see how his comments can be taken as anything other than desperately premature. My hunch is that Mr Musk is simply on a sales pitch - laying the ground work, quite literally, for The Boring Company to get some major investment.

"The conman threatened to send someone to kill Canadian Jakob Dulisse after the challenge. Despite the conversation turning nasty, Mr Dulisse said the threat was just a way to get him to pay money. Microsoft estimates fraudsters make about $1.5bn (£1bn) a year through fake Windows support calls. Older victims The fake Microsoft tech support scam has been operating for many years and typically involves tricking a victim into paying to fix non-existent security threats on their home computer. More recently people who know about the scam have been trying to turn the tables on the conmen by stringing them along and recording what happens next. Mr Dulisse told the Go Public radio show that he spotted the scam early on in the call and then started asking questions about why he was targeted. Mr Dulisse also recorded the exchange. He said when he asked why the caller was trying to make people pay for services they did not need, the conversation took a ""sinister turn"". The man admitted he was in India and said ""Anglo"" people who travel to the country were ""cut up in little pieces"" and thrown in the river. The conman then quoted Mr Dulisse's address and said he would send someone round to kill him. ""He was actually threatening me as a tactic,"" said Mr Dulisse. ""He was still trying to get me to do what he was trying to do with my computer."" Growing awareness of the support call scam was making the fraudsters more aggressive, said Gregg Keizer from Computerworld. Some victims are called many times a day to wear down their resistance, he said. Figures released in January by Action Fraud - the UK's national reporting centre for fraud - suggest fraudsters are targeting people who are unfamiliar with computers to maximise their chances of success. The average age of UK victims is 59, it said, and on average each one loses £210 to the conmen. In the six months between June and November 2014, there were more than 12,000 reports of fake computer support frauds, it said.","A bogus PC support call turned nasty when a victim asked the scammer why he was trying to steal money from people, reports CBC."
"Dave LeeNorth America technology reporter The company said it had deployed more than 200,000 warehouse robots working in around 50 of its locations. But despite Amazon investing heavily in advanced robotics, Tye Brady said the firm’s centres would never reach the point where they could be fully automated. “Not at all. One ounce of my body just doesn’t see that,” he said. “The way that I think about this is a symphony of humans and machines working together, you need both. “The challenge that we have in front of us is how do we smartly design our machines to extend human capability.” Mr Brady was speaking to the BBC at Re:Mars, an Amazon event intended to showcase the firm’s latest work in machine learning, automation, robotics and space. He told the BBC the suggestion that robotics and AI would replace humans was a “myth”. “It's a reframing of your relationship with machines, right? “You extend human capability. And when you gain productivity, then you have the ability to create new jobs that were unimaginable five years ago.” ‘Stop BEZOS Act’ But the nature of those jobs has been harshly criticised. The UK-based GMB trade union organised a worker strike last November, describing conditions for employees at Amazon’s warehouses as “inhuman”. “They are breaking bones, being knocked unconscious and being taken away in ambulances,” said GMB General Secretary Tim Roache in a statement. “We’re standing up and saying enough is enough, these are people making Amazon its money. People with kids, homes, bills to pay - they’re not robots.” In response, Amazon at the time said: “All of our sites are safe places to work and reports to the contrary are simply wrong.” But the firm is making changes in response to pressure. Earlier this year, Amazon increased its minimum wage for warehouse workers to $15 (£12) after considerable pressure from, among others, potential Democratic presidential nominee, Bernie Sanders. He, along with Californian Congressman Ro Khanna, introduced legislation that would add an additional tax on corporations if their lowest paid employees relied on government programmes, such as food stamps, to make ends meet. The measure was titled Stop Bad Employers by Zeroing Out Subsidies, or Stop BEZOS, for short - a reference to Amazon’s founder and chief executive, Jeff Bezos. ‘Orange nightstand on wheels’ One of the company’s announcements was Pegasus, a new robot that is being used in the firm’s “sortation centres” - the last step before a package is handed off to a delivery company. “Resembling an orange nightstand on wheels, the two-feet-high, 3-feet-wide Pegasus drive is Amazon's newest robot designed to create greater efficiency in its sortation process so customers can receive their orders even faster,” the firm said in a blog post. An accompanying video showed humans placing packages on to the robot, which then carried it, autonomously, to another location ready to be taken out for delivery. The system is able to work out the quickest route for the robots to take, taking into account the hundreds of other robots moving around at the same time. A “flow control specialist” monitors the movements of up to 800 Pegasus robots at once. The company also announced it had made Xanthus, an updated version of its pallet-moving robot used in fulfilment centres. The firm said its robots had to date stacked more than 2 billion plastic storage boxes, known as totes. But one task robots still struggle greatly with is picking up individual objects of varying shapes and standards - which is still a key job of the human worker, particularly in the areas of Amazon’s business that deal with food handling. “It's not humans versus machines at all,” Mr Brady told the BBC. “It's humans and machines working together to achieve a task.” _______ Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC Do you have more information about this or any other technology story?

"By Katia MoskvitchTechnology reporter, BBC News, Taipei For Taiwanese smartphone maker HTC, a lot is riding on its appeal. The new HTC One, shown exclusively to the BBC at the company's headquarters in Taiwan's capital Taipei weeks before its official launch, differs starkly from HTC's previous phones - and from many other smartphones currently on the market. Like the iPhone 5, it has a unibody made out of metal. ""It's just like your watch - you don't need a plastic watch,"" says Thomas Chien, one of HTC's vice-presidents of design, as he caresses the aluminium body of the handset. But the HTC One is launching into an utterly crowded market, dominated by Samsung with its Galaxy S3 and Apple with its iPhone 5. Fighting for the number three spot is a gaggle of players, from Blackberry and Nokia to LG and HTC. Snapping on their heels are new players from China like Huawei and ZTE. It's in stark contrast to just a few years ago, when HTC looked like the only plausible challenger to Apple and its iPhone. For its fightback, HTC has packed its new Android-based smartphone with innovations that the company says create a ""totally new experience"". ""We think it's the first time we came up with a design not just from the hardware side - it's kind of a new experience from outside and inside,"" says Mr Chien, sitting in an open-plan office on the 15th floor of HTC's headquarters. Pixel density He takes me to a large table littered with mobile phones of all shapes and colours, next to paper sketches of early designs for the HTC One. Mr Chien picks up a slab of solid aluminium: ""That's how it all starts."" The metal is ground, cut, pierced, polished, and then packed with electronics and finished off with a 4.7in (12cm) display, offering an industry-leading 468 pixels per inch (ppi). Most people can't see the difference in quality beyond 300ppi but Mr Chien says the pixel density is still important, because it can display much finer detail. ""We always push boundaries. You never really define that something is enough for humans,"" he says. HTC also hopes to make a difference with features like BlinkFeed, a live stream of personalised content that shows up on the phone's home screen when it is switched on; the so-called Living Gallery that merges stills and video; dual front-facing speakers promising, says HTC, a better music experience. Innovation, however, does not guarantee success. HTC's previous flagship phone, the HTC One X, was praised by the tech-savvy. A reviewer at hip technology website The Verge called it ""one of the best mobile devices I've ever used"". Tech blog Engadget described the One X as ""a masterpiece"", while Pocket-lint accorded it the same score as Samsung's top-selling Galaxy S3. Slumping sales Yet, despite all the features and praise, it was Samsung's Android phone that snatched the crown as the world's top-selling smartphone, followed by Apple's iPhone 4S. The HTC One X struggled and company profits plummeted - in the last quarter of 2012, down a massive 91% on the previous year. So what went wrong? Lu Chun-kuan, a senior research analyst at Gartner Taiwan, points to fierce competition in the smartphone market. ""It's getting more and more difficult - it's not only the competition from Samsung and Apple, but also from the low-end devices of the Chinese players who are catching up very fast,"" he says. ""I think the key is that HTC needs to make sure that consumers are aware of the new technology it can bring them. ""Last year, [two HTC Android smartphones] the Butterfly and the One X were actually very good devices, but their sales were not as good as the company expected. ""This is more than just [doing enough] TV ads - it's the correct way of marketing, how they deliver the correct message to consumers, so that they get that this device is as good as Apple's iPhone and Samsung's Galaxy S."" HTC's chairman Peter Chou readily admits to the BBC that the firm faced challenges last year. But he says the new phone will help the Taiwanese company turn things around: ""We've created the best smartphone on the market; we just need to let the world know about it."" To gain traction in the market, HTC aims to do better marketing than last year, focusing on tech-savvy people, the very same crowd that is now so taken in by the iPhones and Galaxy devices. ""Rather than trying to talk to everyone, we will be engaging with people who are seeking an alternative experience,"" says Mr Chou. ""We will be smart and nimble in our marketing. You will see us take bold risks."" Moving in step While carving a phone out of metal could qualify as taking a bold risk - at least in terms of technology - HTC must make sure that its new ""hero"" phone does not stumble at other hurdles; the One X, for example, had trouble shaking off criticism for its relatively short battery life. ""At the end of the day, a good product will sell itself,"" says Scott Croyle, HTC's other vice-president of design, who once told the BBC that he had drawn inspiration for a handset from a sports shoe. ""To be a successful company, there are a lot of moving parts,"" says Mr Croyle. ""And absolutely - can HTC do better? Yes, I think all of us can do better. ""I think this year we've really focused on innovation and execution. And execution not only in terms of design and engineering, but getting the whole company to move in step as we launch the phone."" For the HTC One to be successful, it requires more than just a feat of engineering.","Yes, this phone is sleek, elegant and finely crafted, but can it be more than just a slab of metal?"
"By Maggie ShielsTechnology reporter, Silicon Valley Its new Instant Pages system will shave between two to five seconds off the time it takes for a web page to load, the company said. It is also planning to offer voice-activated and enhanced image searching. Google, which processes one billion requests every day, said search remained its core focus. The firm still dominates the market although Microsoft's Bing is slowly eating into its share. Bing's US searches rose to 14 percent in May from 12 percent at the end of 2010. It also powers searching on Yahoo, which has 15.9 percent of the market while Google's share slipped to 66 percent from 67 percent, according to measurement firm comScore Instant Pages works by pre-loading the page associated with the top search result in the background as a user decides what to click on. Google relies on its relevance technology to confidently predict the number one result a user will pick. That means when the top pre-rendered link is chosen, the web page opens instantaneously. The search giant said it typically takes around five seconds for a web page to launch once someone clicks on it. ""We at Google will not be happy until we make the Web as easy to flip through as a magazine,"" Google fellow Amit Singhal said at the Inside Search event in San Francisco. ""We are obsessed with speed. We often say speed is still the killer app,"" he added. During a demo at the event the Washington Post home page loaded immediately with Instant Pages, compared to 3.2 seconds without it. Last year the Silicon Valley firm introduced Google Instant which gives users results to queries while queries are being typed into the search box. Positive impact ""What we have observed is that every time we shave 15 milliseconds from the speed, users search more and more, said Mr Singhal. Over the next couple of weeks Instant Pages will be made available to users of Google's Chrome web browser. The company said it would open access to the software code so other browsers such as Firefox and Internet Explorer could also incorporate the feature. ""Making it ubiquitous will make people go wow, Google just made the web faster,"" said Matt Rosoff, west coast editor of Business Insider. ""As far as Google is concerned it is another thing that will continue to draw people to Google and make sure they don't leave for another competitor like Microsoft."" Say it On mobile, Google is offering an alternative to the traditional keyword search with icons linked to common searches such as restaurants, coffee shops and bars. It said that the move was prompted by a rise in searches involving nearby places. The company is also preparing to introduce voice-activated search for personal computers. The feature already exists on mobile devices. The tool, represented by a small microphone icon in the far right of the Google search box, will appear over the coming days. In a demonstration, reporters were shown that the search engine understands the difference between Worcester, Massachusetts, and Wooster College - words that sound the same but are spelt differently. ""Arguably speaking is the most natural way we learn to express our needs. It remains to be seen what kinds of usage scenarios may be important when it comes to the desktop. As the data comes in we will learn (that) over time,"" said Mike Cohen, manager of speech technology at Google. According to Google, voice search traffic has grown six-fold over the past year, and every day users speak about two years' worth of speech into the system. The company also revealed during its presentation that as many as 230 billion words a day are entered into the language bank system, helping to improve the way it deals with accents, pronunciations and colloquialisms. The speech recognition tool will only be available on Google's Chrome web browser for now but executives said they hope other software makers would eventually implement the technology.",Google has made changes to its search engine as it strives to get consumers the information they want faster.
"By Jon ManelBBC Radio 4 His smart phone had, in effect, been hijacked and he was being asked to pay a ransom. ""My device had been locked"", he told BBC Radio 4's PM Programme. He was being instructed ""to send some money via a voucher code to get the phone unlocked"". Ken Main knows how Nick felt. It happened to him with the computers at his hairdressing salon in Glasgow. ""It was a pale blue screen with the message right in the middle,"" he explained. ""If we wanted the information back we would have to pay a ransom."" Cash call They had both become victims of what is known as ransomware - a type of computer virus which unlocks the users out of their computers or phones and demands money for the return of the files. ""It's like somebody breaking into your house"", Ken said."" It was a message which kind of created the same sort of emotional fear and then you start thinking 'God, what happens if I can't get this information back?'"" You are probably now trying to guess how much Ken and Nick were being asked to pay. It is possibly quite a lot lower than you would think. ""They asked me for $50 or €50"" Nick recalled. For Ken it was slightly more. ""They were looking for a ransom of $350 initially,"" he said. ""When we contacted them by email, they put that up to €1000."" The demands are set at what is regarded as a payable level, according to Jornt van der Wiel from the security software company, Kaspersky Lab. They tend to be for ""the amount of money that people are still willing to pay in order to get their files back."" He explained, for a small business, ""Sometimes it's cheaper for the company just to pay the ransom than to put back the backup because that in the end costs more"". Police files Nick Harvey did not have to part with any money. He managed to get his phone working again although he did lose some data. Ken, however, felt he had no choice but to pay up. ""I said, 'Well I need that bloody information back. I've got a business to run here.' I think any businessman in my position would say 'Yes! Let's do it', because I've got no other way of getting information to rebuild that database."" According to Mr van der Wiel, ransomware can enter your computer via malicious email attachments. His advice is not to open any file which you are suspicious about. He says there can also be a problem if the latest ""security patches"" on your internet browser have not been installed. Such are the difficulties that a ransomware attack can create; even those responsible for enforcing the law have given into the criminals. When the systems at the police department in Tewksbury, Massachusetts, were affected, computer experts tried everything but to no avail. ""We couldn't restore it from an external back-up"" Chief Timothy Sheehan said ""because that was also corrupted and the taped back-up we had was at least 18 months old. We realised we were in a perfect storm. We were in a very bad situation."" The police department paid the ransom via a third party. ""Ultimately we decided that in our particular situation we should take the shot of paying the 500 dollars in bitcoin and see if we got the decryption key returned to us and we could return all of the data that was encrypted back to its normal status."" Chief Sheehan conceded that it meant paying money to criminals and he now wants to highlight the threat ransomware poses. Data loss According to Raj Samani, Intel Security's chief technology officer in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, those behind ransomware are making hundreds of millions of dollars. He said there has been ""enormous growth in ransomware certainly over the last 12 months"". He believes people in the UK are particularly vulnerable. There are many different types of ransomware viruses but according to Mr Samani ""in almost every single type we look at, the UK is either second or third on that list, so I would argue that the UK is targeted disproportionately with regards to the number of internet users that we have."" Security experts have found ways of unlocking some forms of ransomware but those behind the cyber criminals are developing more sophisticated viruses too. Back in the hairdressers in Glasgow, Ken Main has no regrets about paying the ransom. However, it didn't solve all his problems. Do not think paying up means all will end well. ""I would say 80 to 90% of the information was corrupted"" he said. ""In terms of hard cash income I would say we were probably down by about £20,000.""",Something wasn't right about the phone screen. It had gone dark. That's when Nick Harvey examined it more closely. It looked odd. And it was then that he saw the message.
"By Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent The attack, using US firm SolarWinds' Orion platform, was discovered last week but has been going on for months. A number of organisations, including US government departments, are understood to have been targeted. A UK security source said ""numbers in the UK are small and the organisations are not in the public sector"". But it's still early days in the investigation and more details could yet emerge. What is described as a highly sophisticated cyber espionage operation had been under way for some months before it was spotted. The access provided through compromising software from SolarWinds appears to have been used to steal data rather than for any disruptive or destructive impact. It could have allowed the hackers to take a high degree of control over organisation's networks, but just because someone downloaded the software does not necessarily mean data was taken. It appears those behind it targeted a narrow set of organisations in an attempt to steal national-security, defence and other related information. There is no sign that significant theft of large amounts of customer or citizen data was an aim of the operation. Microsoft and US officials have also suggested there might have been other methods of getting into networks as well as via the compromised SolarWinds update. It is possible the attack could pre-date March, when SolarWinds was first affected. The UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) - an arm of intelligence agency GCHQ - is at the forefront of responding and is working with government and industry to provide advice and investigate what might have been stolen. ""This is a complex, global cyber incident, and we are working with international partners to fully understand its scale and any UK impact,"" said NCSC director of operations Paul Chichester. ""The NCSC is working to mitigate any potential risk, and actionable guidance has been published to our website. We urge organisations to take immediate steps to protect their networks - and will continue to update as we learn more."" 'Large-scale digital espionage' Microsoft said it had informed at least one UK customer that it had been compromised in a linked attack, but the numbers affected are thought to be small and apparently not government-related, although a risk to national security remains. A full assessment of the damage in the US as well as the UK may take many months, as experts scour networks for signs of data being stolen. ""Based on what we currently know, this is very large-scale digital espionage of the type that's been going on for many years,"" Ciaran Martin, the former head of the NCSC told the BBC. ""This is an unusually sophisticated compromise. It reinforces the point that securing the supply chain is one of the hardest challenges around,"" US officials have suggested they believe Russia was responsible and the type of high-end espionage operation fits in with past behaviour of Russian hackers. But neither the US nor UK has yet formally and publicly ""attributed"" the attack, even though it is clear they believe a nation state was responsible. Moscow has denied any role in it.",UK security officials are trying to establish the extent of the impact on the UK of a major hacking campaign that threatened national security in the US.
"It upheld a complaint from a recipient of the email, an offer limited to the first 28,527 people to respond. PayPal said that it had made this clear in the terms and conditions. But the ASA said the ad must not appear in its current form again. ""We considered that consumers were likely to understand from the subject line and headline claim that they would receive credit worth £10 from PayPal, and the subsequent qualification was insufficient to counter that impression, so we concluded that the ad was misleading and breached the code,"" wrote the ASA in its ruling. In its defence, PayPal said that the marketing email ""was designed to inform customers about the availability of the offer and included all significant qualifications and conditions"". The email from PayPal, received on 29 September 2020, featured the greeting: ""Long time no see. Here's a £10 reward for you!"" The headline claim in the body of the email stated: ""We're giving you £10 to use online with PayPal"" followed by a clickable""Save Offer"" button. The fact the offer was limited to the first 28,527 people to apply was only stated in the small print below. In recent months, the ASA has banned a series of online ads. In October it ruled that using fluffy animals in an advert for gambling site Gala Spins was irresponsible as it was likely to appeal to under-18s. Mobile game ads that showed content very different from the actual product were also banned. And it has repeatedly warned social media influencers that their posts must make it clear if they are adverts.","An email sent by payment giant PayPal which promised customers a reward of £10 for using their account did not make it clear enough that not everyone would receive it, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has ruled."
"The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) was currently defeating about 10 attacks every week, it said. Most of the attacks were carried out by state-sponsored hackers employed by hostile nations, it added. During its first two years of operation the NCSC has also tackled phishing sites which prey on UK consumers. Attack domains ""We are calling out unacceptable behaviour by hostile states and giving our businesses the specific information they need to defend themselves,"" said Ciaran Martin, head of the NCSC, in a statement. Late last year, Mr Martin singled out Russia as one power actively working to attack firms working in the UK's media, telecoms and energy sectors. Revealing the review, Mr Martin said the Centre was also doing work to fortify the UK's critical infrastructure and to wrap other protections around the net, so it was ""automatically safer"". Mr Martin said he had ""little doubt"" that the UK would at some point be ""tested to the full"" by a major incident. As well as defeating sophisticated attacks by foreign powers, said the review, the NCSC had also sought to shut down net sites and domains used in phishing attacks. From mid-2017 to summer 2018, this activity led to the closure of almost 140,000 sites located in the UK that were crafted to look like they were created by banks, government agencies and businesses. In addition, the NCSC has led an initiative to mark legitimate government domains to help organisations filter emailed threats. It has also produced tools that let firms scan sites to spot common vulnerabilities. The detailed annual review also gives information about the incident response unit at the NCSC which coordinates responses when attacks manage to circumvent defences. The NCSC was setup in 2016 to act as the central body overseeing cyber-security in the UK. As well as tackling high-level threats, it also advises businesses on the best ways to defend themselves. On Monday, the NCSC issued a code of conduct which aims to help makers of smart gadgets secure them against attack.","The UK's top cyber-defence centre has stopped Britain falling victim to almost 1,200 attacks in the last two years, its annual review reveals."
"By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter Experts from the University of Lincoln found that people warmed to a robot if it made mistakes and showed human-like emotions, such as boredom. For the tests, robots were programmed to make errors, and the reactions of human participants were monitored. The findings could affect future robot design, said researchers. Dr John Murray, from the University of Lincoln's computer science department, and PhD researcher Mriganka Biswas conducted experiments with three robots. The first was Erwin (Emotional Robot With Intelligent Network) which was developed at the University of Lincoln's school of computer science, and can express five basic emotions. The second was Keepon, a small yellow robot designed to study social development by interacting with children, while the third was a 3D-printed humanoid robot called Marc (Multi-Actuated Robotic Companion). The researchers introduced a set of what they called ""cognitive biases"" to the programming which included allowing the robots to make mistakes, wrong assumptions, as well as expressing more human-like emotions such as getting tired, bored or over-excited. For half of the time interacting with human participants the robots were not affected by these biases. ""We monitored how the participants responded to the robots and overwhelmingly found that they paid attention for longer and actually enjoyed the fact that a robot could make common mistakes, forget facts and express more extreme emotions, just as humans can,"" said Mr Biswas. ""We have shown that flaws in their 'characters' help humans to understand, relate to and interact with the robots more easily."" Friendly companion Companion robots are increasingly being used to support those who care for elderly people or for children with autism but most human-robot interaction is based on a set of well-ordered and structured rules and behaviours. ""The human perception of robots is often affected by science fiction, however, there is a very real conflict between this perception of superior and distant robots, and the aim of human-robot interaction researchers,"" said Mr Biswas. ""A companion robot needs to be friendly and have the ability to recognise users' emotions and needs, and act accordingly. Despite this, robots used in previous research have lacked human characteristics so that users cannot relate - how can we interact with something that is more perfect than we are?"" His findings were presented at the International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems in Hamburg this month. ""As long as a robot can show imperfections which are similar to those of humans during their interactions, we are confident that long-term human-robot relations can be developed,"" said Mr Biswas. Fellow researcher Dr Murray told the BBC that how robots interact socially will be key to future robot research. ""Obviously it depends on the application and, in a factory, we don't want robots that make mistakes,"" he said. ""But with robot companions, it is not so much the look of the robot but its behaviour. If you want a robot to become friendly and for people not to wary of it, it will need certain traits.""","Robots that display human-like vulnerabilities may get on better with people than ones programmed to be too perfect, researchers suggest."
"NTT West is hosting the trial - which runs until Friday - and says it believes it is the first of its kind. A new video compression standard is being used to reduce the amount of data that needs to be transmitted. 4K broadcasts offer four times the amount of detail as 1080p high-definition content. Compressing technologies allow broadcasters to transmit material using much less data than would otherwise be required while minimising the loss of picture quality. With regard to video, instead of sending data describing each pixel of each frame as if it were a standalone entity, a variety of algorithms are used to analyse how colour is distributed across each image and what changes occur between each frame. This is then used to allow redundant information to be discarded, providing instead only the information needed to reconstruct a sequence based on an understanding of how each pixel and frame are related to each other. At present the H.264/MPEG-4 codec is commonly used to broadcast digital TV - including the UK's Freeview HD and Sky HD satellite services - as well as the vast majority of video clips on the web. In January the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), a UN agency, approved a new format to succeed it called the H.265 High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) standard. It allows 4K and 1080p videos to be streamed using roughly half the bit rate, meaning half as much data needs to be transmitted, thanks to the use of more advanced algorithms. The ITU said it should meet the needs of broadcasters for ""the next decade"". Although 4K ultra-high-definition televisions are already on the market, content is scarce and most owners have relied on the sets' ability to upscale existing HD signals. Japan plans to become the first country to broadcast 4K programming over satellite from 2014, in time for the football World Cup. But the ability to stream ultra-high-definition video over the net would open the door to other services. ""The logical consequence would be that this technology could be used by firms like Netflix to start offering limited premium 4K video subscription packages with higher-definition movies and shows to compete with the traditional pay-TV operators,"" said Jon Payne, broadband analyst at consultants IHS.",A Japanese telecoms company is carrying out tests to try to prove 4K-resolution video can be streamed over the internet to television set-top boxes.
"By Helen SoteriouTechnology writer Success is valued so highly that some people now make their living offering hints and tricks about how to prove popular. Nick Taylor is one such expert at London-based PeerIndex - a firm that crunches data on millions of tweets a week to advise its clients on what works. He stresses a need to start with the basics. Pause to think about your profile picture and description before you start tweeting. ""Pick something personal which says something about you specifically,"" he says. ""Remember the Twitter profile photo is very small so a full-face image is going to be easier to see than a full-body."" ""With your bio try telling people about the sort of things you tweet about, that way they can easily decide to follow you based on shared interests."" Twitter's new layout allows you to add a Facebook-style banner image at the top - so, it's worth thinking about whether you want to use the virtual real estate to post a second larger photo of yourself or another image that tells visitors about your interests. Seriously, be funny An uncluttered wallpaper that also speaks to your personality can also make your profile seem appealing. But once you have finished fiddling with the layout how should you reel people in? Time to turn to David Schneider - an actor who has starred in I'm Alan Partridge and Mission: Impossible, and who now uses his comedic skills to help brands and businesses boost their Twitter engagement. ""Your perfect tweets will have at least one of the following: information, insight, and humour,"" says the founder of the consultancy That Lot. ""If it has all three then it is going to be incredibly shareable. ""Information is stuff that people want to know. Insight is 'here you are behind the scenes', and humour is humour."" He adds that it is also important to get the right tone, saying successful tweeters usually sound as if they are writing an email to a mate. His colleague David Levin later follows up with a few other dos and don'ts - all helpfully running to less than 140 characters: Twitter table-manners Twitter etiquette suggests that you should also follow and retweet others. It's not obligatory - a spoof account for the Queen has racked up more than one million followers without doing so. ""One's a leader, not a follower,"" explains @Queen_UK. But parody accounts aside, it can prove wise to appear neither too self-involved nor too trigger-happy. ""The follow-back can become a bit of a game on Twitter, which is not what it's designed for,"" says Mr Taylor. ""You should only really be following someone if you're going to be interested in what they tweet. ""Some users will un-follow you if you don't follow them back after a certain period - but are these really the followers you want in the first place?"" He says there are also a couple of rules to be aware of when using the network's name function. ""If you are talking about someone - especially when you have something bad to say - mention their @ handle - it's rude to talk behind people's backs,"" he explains. ""And remember that any tweet starting with @person will only be seen by the people who follow you and @person, no one else. ""If you want to start with their name but have it seen by others, put a full stop before it. For example: '.@person is great.'"" Wider picture While breaking through the 1,000-follower barrier can be seen as a sign that you're doing something right, one expert suggests you should not become too fixated on your follower-count. Dr Meeyoung Cha used software to analyse the network's first three-and-a-half years of public posts - a total of nearly two billion tweets. ""Our work is about how individuals, companies, and celebrities exploit social media to increase their influence,"" says the academic at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science. ""What we find is that follower count does not equal influence - in fact it is a bad indicator. ""We came to this conclusion after seeing those with the highest number of followers do not receive the same high level interaction with the audience - like retweets or mentions. ""It takes other qualities to make someone do an action like forwarding your message, engaging in conversations, being talked about."" It seems your Twitter skills can only get you so far. Ultimately it's what you do with the rest of your time that determines your true social status. Or, as Brooklyn-based artist and rapper Cortez told his 30,000 followers last month: ""Why have followers if u do nothing with them? 40k followers & no mixtapes, videos, Merch, shows! Nothing!!!#HustlinBackwards""","Whether you are new to Twitter or a seasoned pro, this week's announcement of the rollout of a revamped look for the social network was a reminder that you need to make the most of the options it offers if you want to build up your number of followers and keep them hooked."
"By Zoe Kleinman & Mary-Ann RussonTechnology reporters, BBC News There had been speculation that the tech giant was planning to shutter the music service it launched in 2001. The firm also revealed a number of new privacy measures at its annual developer conference in San Jose. A new sign-in will be an alternative to logging into apps using social media accounts, hiding the user's email address and data. iTunes will remain unchanged on Windows platforms, and downloads will still be available in a sidebar on the Apple Music app for Macs. The announcements were made at the WWDC conference, where the tech giant outlines its software plans for the months ahead. Privacy Apple announced several new privacy measures, building on last year's event where it pledged to jam Facebook's tracking tools. ""Privacy is a fundamental human right,"" said Apple's software chief Craig Federighi. He said that there will be an option for apps which request location information to have to ask every time they require it, and they will be blocked from using other markers, such as identifying Wi-Fi or Bluetooth signals. Apple is also launching a sign-in-with-Apple login, as an alternative to logging in to a service using a social media account. Using this login, users can choose to hide their email address, with Apple creating a random alternative address which will forward to the real mailbox. ""The unveiling of 'Sign-in With Apple' will concern rivals, particularly the web giants,"" commented Ben Wood from CCS Insight. ""Existing sign-in services provide a simple means for single sign-in across the web. Privacy is the differentiator that will be heavily emphasised versus Facebook and Google, and represents a great marketing tool for Apple's broader privacy stance."" iOS 13 The next iteration of the iPhone's operating system - iOS 13 - includes a range of changes to its interface, as well as new functions. The new Dark Mode enables iPhone apps to be viewed with a black background, while the Apple Maps app will come with a virtual tour experience similar to Google's Street View. Other key features include the option to silence unknown callers and block senders within the Mail app, improved search in messages, and optimised battery charging. Apple has also made improvements to its language keyboards, including the introduction of new bilingual keyboards and typing predictions for Arabic, Hindi, Thai, Cantonese, Vietnamese and the 22 official Indian languages. Other news from the conference included: Apple Watch The Apple Watch is to become more independent from the iPhone with its own app store. New apps for the Watch include a menstrual cycle tracker, with an optional fertility window predictor, and a noise level tool to alert Watch wearers when they are around noise levels that can damage hearing. Apple said it would not record or store the noise data. Mac Pro The tech giant also unveiled a redesigned Mac Pro complete with a 28-core Intel processor and 6k retina display screen, which is 40% larger than the current iMac display screen. It will launch in the autumn with prices starting at $5,999 (£4,700) - this does not include the screen or stand. And instead of buying additional monitors, existing Mac users will now be able to use the iPad as a second screen. Tuong Nguyen, senior principal analyst at Gartner, said this year's event had a different feel to its predecessors, following on from Apple's last announcements which saw it reposition itself as a provider of services, rather than hardware. ""Typically at WWDC you might see it begin with something interesting, in terms of how devices are used or how apps interact, but this time it kicked off with a video that looked more like a movie trailer,"" he said. ""Is this the new way we should see Apple events, more rooted in the media content side of things, rather than the strong emphasis on technology and hardware innovation? ""Remember, the last event was all about services and content - this may be the new way that Apple differentiates itself.""","Apple has announced that iTunes is to be replaced by Apple Music, Apple Podcasts and Apple TV."
"By Mark WardTechnology correspondent Symantec, BitDefender and Intel unveiled devices that scrutinise data as it flows across home networks. The companies say routers with built-in defences will be essential as homes are filled with net-connected gadgets. The routers also come with parental control features that help manage how much time children spend online and what they see. Home invasion ""You will have to buy a security solution for your internet-of-things,"" said Alex Balan, chief security researcher at BitDefender. The ""internet of things"" refers to the growing collection of smart gadgets that can be controlled via the net. ""Pretty soon everything will be connected one way or another and managed by a smartphone app,"" said Mr Balan. ""You won't be able to avoid it."" But that interconnectivity and ease of use comes at a cost, he said, adding that the end of 2016 had seen a surge in attacks that compromised net-connected CCTV cameras, televisions and media servers. The poor security on these gadgets led to them being enrolled in massive networks by hackers who use them to carry out overwhelming attacks. One network, called Mirai, staged some of the biggest net attacks ever seen. The problem has got so serious that the US Federal Trade Commission has kicked off a competition to create tools that consumers can add to their home network that can protect IoT devices from attack. Cash rewards of $25,000 (£20,000) will be given to the best entrants. ""Security for these devices has to start at the network level,"" said Gareth Lockwood from Symantec. ""There's no other way to do it."" As the entry and exit point for home networks, routers were the best place to put a security system that can watch for malicious traffic coming in and cut off hackers trying to access insecure kit. While current home routers do have security systems, most are pretty basic, said Mr Lockwood, and none is ready for the explosion of smart devices predicted to be in use soon. ""If we look forward four to five years from now we expect to see between 20 to 30 billion devices in homes,"" he said. ""There'll be tens of devices per household.""

All three will face competition from established devices such as the Cujo smart firewall and the Home Halo and Eero products as well as from Asus which has teamed up with Trend Micro to put security software on its routers. The devices launched at CES will only initially be available in the US but will reach other regions later in 2017. Typically, buying one of the secure routers includes a subscription to a firm's standard security software that runs on desktops, laptops and tablets. All three also include net access control systems that let parents decide for how long different gadgets can be used and which sites youngsters can visit.

"By Chris BaraniukTechnology reporter The police in Toronto gave no further information about the deaths. Ashley Madison's Canadian parent company Avid Life Media is offering a C$500,000 (£240,000) reward for information on the hackers, they added. Details of more than 33m accounts were stolen from the website, which offers users the chance to have an affair. Addressing the hackers, known as The Impact Team, acting staff superintendent Bryce Evans of the Toronto police said: ""I want to make it very clear to you your actions are illegal and we will not be tolerating them. This is your wake-up call."" Police are seeking information from members of the wider hacker community that might aid their investigation. The breach was ""very sophisticated"", said Detective Menard from the technological crime unit of Toronto Police. Cash reward Mr Evans confirmed that credit card data was included in the original data dump released by The Impact Team. He said that investigators believed this was limited to the last four digits of the main card number. Consequently, police are advising victims of the hack to review their accounts. He also explained that the hack had already led to a series of ""spin-offs of crimes and further victimisation"". ""Criminals have already engaged in online scams by claiming to provide access to the leaked websites,"" he said. ""The public needs to be aware that by clicking on these links you are exposing your computers to malware, spyware, adware and viruses."" 'Thunderstruck' The unfolding of the hack was also detailed at the conference - from the moment on 12 July when several Avid Life Media employees logged in to their computers and were confronted by a message from the hackers. This message was accompanied by music - AC/DC's ""Thunderstruck"", said Mr Evans. ""This hack is one of the largest data breaches in the world and is very unique on its own in that it exposed tens of millions of people's personal information,"" he added. Police have set up a Twitter account, @AMCaseTPS, and hashtag, #AMCaseTPS, in a bid to gather information about the hack from members of the public. In a statement, Avid Life Media confirmed the offer of a financial reward for information and it believed the investigation was proceeding positively. ""We are confident that the considerable investigative and prosecutorial power that is being brought to bear on this unprecedented crime will lead to arrests and convictions,"" the firm said.","Two individuals associated with the leak of Ashley Madison customer details are reported to have taken their lives, according to police in Canada."
"By Joe TidyCyber-security reporter ""He would drop snippets into conversations, such as knowing about Sarah's baby. Really private things that he shouldn't have known about. If I asked how he knew these things, he'd say I'd told him and accuse me of losing it,"" she says. Amy - not her real name - also began to wonder how he seemed to know where she was all the time. ""Sometimes he would say he saw me at a cafe where I was meeting my friends and say he was just passing by chance. I started to question everything and trust no-one, even my friends,"" she says. For months, these incidents built up, turning an abusive marriage into a nightmare that came to a chilling conclusion after a Halloween family trip. ""We'd been to visit a pumpkin patch and were having a rare good weekend, which basically means my husband hadn't taken anything out on me. Our six-year-old son was playing on the floor and was so happy,"" Amy says. ""My husband passed me his phone to show me a picture he'd taken at the farm and in that split-second I saw an alert pop up on his screen. It read, 'Daily report on Amy's Mac is ready to view.' ""I felt this chill go through me and I stopped breathing for a minute. I had to excuse myself and pretended I needed the bathroom. I had to be there for my son and pretend that I hadn't seen anything. ""The first moment I could, I went to the library to use the computer and look up the spyware he'd used. That's when everything made sense after months of thinking I was going crazy."" Stalkerware - also known as spouseware - are powerful surveillance software programs typically sold openly online. On a device, all messages can be read, screen activity recorded, GPS locations tracked and cameras used to spy on what an individual is doing. Tips to avoid being victimised: Don’t leavedevice unattended – most software requires physical access Ditch fingerprintlock - a partner can use your print while you sleep Add security app- antivirus software can also detect spyware and remove it According to cyber-security company Kaspersky, the number of people who have discovered such software on their devices has risen by at least 35% in the past year. Kaspersky researchers say their protection technologies have detected stalkerware on 37,532 devices so far this year. And principal security researcher David Emm says this is the ""tip of a very large iceberg"". ""Most people will routinely protect a laptop or desktop, not that many people actually protect a mobile device,"" he says. ""This information is coming back from installations of our product on [smartphones]... so this figure doesn't even go close to what the total would be."" Kaspersky's findings indicate Russia is the country with the highest levels of stalkerware activity. India, Brazil, the United States and Germany complete the top five, with the UK in eighth place with 730 detections. Another security company says there are practical steps people can take if they suspect they are already being spied on. ""It's always advisable to check which apps are on your phone and conduct a virus scan where necessary and if there are any apps on your device that you do not recognise it is worth searching online for reviews and deleting them,"" says Jake Moore, from Eset. ""As a general rule, if you aren't using an app, delete it."" Once Amy realised her computer had been compromised, she developed a severe mistrust of technology, which she is only just overcoming. Charities say this is a common psychological response to such a trauma. Jessica was another victim of stalkerware. Her ex-husband routinely spied on her through her phone's microphone and would play mind games by repeating specific phrases she and her friends had used in private conversations. It's been years since she escaped the relationship but she still leaves her phone locked in the car when seeing friends. Gemma Toynton, from domestic abuse charity Safer Places, says she see this long-term effect a lot in her cases. ""It reduces someone's trust,"" she says. ""It makes them see a phone or laptop as a weapon, because that's what it's been used for. ""Technology has become, in their minds like a net around them and a lot of people do withdraw from using the internet. ""It really does impact your whole life. The fact that this stalkerware is on the rise is a real concern."" Amy, who is from the US, is now divorced and lives many miles away from her ex-husband. She has a restraining order preventing him from direct contact with her and he is legally allowed to communicate logistics about their son's care via written letter only. Put to the test I tested out one of the most popular consumer products, which costs £140 for three months of surveillance. I bought it online and installed it on to my work phone. It took me about an hour and I used the 24-hour live support offered by the company when I encountered any problems. Spyware companies advertise their services as ""employee monitoring"" or ""parental control"" products. In many countries, including the UK, using the spyware on a spouse without their permission is illegal, so many of the companies' websites are littered with disclaimers advising against this. However, some of the same websites link to articles, seemingly written by associates, recommending the software as a spy tool for ""cheatings wives and husbands"". In a live chat with the company whose product I was testing, I directly told them: ""I want to install this on my wife's phone, will it be secret?"" The customer service-representative responded: ""The application will start to work in stealth mode right after installation. I'll be happy to help."" I also downloaded five of the top cyber-security products on to the infected mobile and carried out a free scan. All of them gave alerts for ""potentially harmful software"". The Crown Prosecution Service says there aren't specific laws related to the use of stalkerware but any criminal activity like this can be prosecuted by a number of means including the Protection from Harassment Act 1997. Amy says more should be done to legislate against the use of these technologies. ""They need to stop hiding behind plausible deniability,"" she says. ""There is a wink that's given when they send this little disclaimer that says, 'We don't approve of you spying on wives.' They know what their customers are doing though. This software causes real harm.""",Amy says it all started when her husband seemed to know intimate details about her friends.
"The ruling by the European Court of Justice lets people ask Google to remove some types of information about them from its search index. Google opposes the ruling, which has led more than 90,000 people to apply for data about them to be scrubbed. One privacy expert was sceptical about the meetings, saying they had more to do with PR than open discussion. Data decisions The first meeting takes place in Madrid on 9 September, with the other six due to be held in other European capitals before 4 November. The meetings will be chaired and run by an advisory council Google set up in the wake of the ruling. The council includes Wikimedia founder Jimmy Wales, former privacy officials and ex-judges. Google is seeking input from experts to speak at the meetings, which it said were being held to discuss how ""one person's right to be forgotten should be balanced with the public's right to information"". The ruling only affects searches done in Europe. It said the obligation to remove some information was a ""new and difficult challenge"" and it wanted help to guide its decisions about when to remove links to information and when to refuse. Up to mid-July Google said it had received about 90,000 applications to remove data applicants considered to be ""inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant"". The requests have involved criminal trials, embarrassing photographs, bullying and news articles that portray some people in a poor light. The search giant is believed to have acted on about half of these applications. Applicants can appeal if their request is refused. The European Commission welcomed the meetings, spokesman Michele Cercone told Bloomberg, adding that exactly how the ruling should be enforced was the responsibility of national data protection regulators. Google's meetings start just before a 15 September gathering at which European data protection regulators will hash out guidelines on the ""right to be forgotten"" for all search engines to ensure all requests to remove are treated consistently. Isabelle Falque-Pierrotin, head of CNIL - France's data protection body - said the debates were more about getting good PR for Google. ""They want to be seen as being open and virtuous, but they handpicked the members of the council, will control who is in the audience, and what comes out of the meetings,"" she told Reuters.","Google is holding seven public meetings across Europe to debate issues raised by the ""right to be forgotten"" ruling."
"By Niri Shan and Lorna CaddyMedia lawyers, Taylor Wessing Following the broadcast, there was much speculation as to who that politician was. Some of this discussion was via Twitter, with individuals linking Lord McAlpine to the Newsnight report - causing his name to appear as a ""trending topic"". Media reports suggest that Lord McAlpine may be considering suing at least some of those thousands of people for libel. The legal position of an individual who posts content online, be it on Facebook, Twitter, or on comment sections of online news pages, is clear: He or she is responsible for that content. Ignorance of the law is not a defence. Foreseeable consequence When individuals post material online, they act as publishers and their publications are subject to the same laws as those of professional publishers, such as newspapers. This includes publications made by way of a tweet. A retweet also amounts to a further publication. The person who retweets that material will be responsible for the content of that retweet. In addition, the individual who originally tweeted the defamatory tweet is also likely to be held responsible for any retweets. While this may seem beyond the original tweeter's control, this is because it is a reasonably foreseeable consequence that a defamatory tweet might be retweeted. It is not a defence for an individual to say that he was simply repeating a statement by someone else. Just because something is out there does not make it OK to repeat. The courts consider each tweet to be a libel, and the more often it is repeated, the more damage it can do and the more libel actions it may provoke. Furthermore, when it comes to proving the truth of the allegation, it is insufficient to point to the fact that somebody has been accurately quoted - the publisher has to prove the substance of the allegation. In other words, if I were to make an allegation about my boss that is retweeted by my friend - my friend must be able to prove the allegation, not just simply that I had said it. Even if you cannot prove that the tweet is true, there could be a credible public interest defence. However, in previous cases the courts have made it very clear that they expect a defendant to demonstrate that he or she has engaged in responsible journalism before the defence will succeed, including verifying the story and giving the subject an opportunity to comment. Swift apology For people simply retweeting something they have read on Twitter, this defence is unlikely to succeed. In these cases, people could be exposed to claims for damages approaching six figures depending on the extent of publication and any other mitigating factors - such as a swift public apology. If Lord McAlpine does sue in relation to some of the recent tweets, the cases will join the increasing number resulting from individuals' use of social media. In the UK's first libel case involving Twitter, New Zealand cricketer Chris Cairns was awarded £90,000 in damages after he was wrongly accused of match-fixing by Lalit Modi, the former chairman of the Indian Premier League. In explaining his ruling, Lord Chief Justice Lord Judge said that as a consequence of modern technology and communication systems, stories had the capacity to ""go viral"" more widely and more quickly than ever before. He said the scale of the problem is ""immeasurably enhanced"" by social networking sites. The message we are hearing loud and clear from the courts is that the public cannot treat Twitter and Facebook as they would a casual chat in the pub.

"The tech firm has seen its stock tumble more than 40% over the past seven months despite posting its highest ever sales and profit figures in January. Its second quarter update, due out later this Tuesday, could either restore or further erode confidence. Part of the problem has been weak earnings from some of the firm's suppliers, coupled with a rash of ""leaks"" suggesting that Apple had cut component orders in the face of weaker-than-expected demand. Chief executive Tim Cook has warned analysts that Apple's supply chain is ""very complex"", urging them to ""question the accuracy"" of rumours - but that has not stopped the speculation. Investors' willingness to believe the worst can in part by explained by the rapid rise of Android - and in particular the popularity of Samsung's Galaxy range. Apple's defenders point out that the iPhone-maker's share of tech-hardware profits outweighs its market share, and that sales from the firm's digital stores also outperform those of rivals. But the wider issue is that Apple's stock price had been inflated by the expectation it could repeat past successes with new categories of products, and investors have become impatient. As popular as they have been, the iPhone 5 and iPad Mini are seen as evolution rather than revolution products. As a consequence, right or wrong, it has become fashionable to question whether Tim Cook can match the late Steve Jobs's ability to ""think different"". With that in mind the BBC asked four company watchers their views about what the firm's research and development teams might be working on - a smart-watch, a major revamp of the iOS operating system, the long-rumoured Apple TV screen and the possibility of something unexpected. Paddy Smith, Stuff magazine There are always rumours, sometimes plausible ones, about Apple's next move. But a smart-watch would be the least risky venture for the Californian computer giant. After all, it has already made an iPod Nano that could be worn on your wrist. A 2011 patent filing suggests the firm has at least considered the idea - but Apple has applied for intellectual property rights to an astonishing array of ideas that never saw the light of day. Yet there are many good reasons why Tim Cook might green-light an Apple smart-watch. It would be less risky than, for instance, launching into the crowded TV market, and investors are crying out for a ""revolutionary"" new product. But it will need to bring a smart-watch to market that can do for technological wrist-wear what the iPhone did for smartphones, what the iPad did for tablets and what the App Store did for software. All these categories existed before Apple got involved in them, yet its understanding of user-experience and product design consistently left competitors racing to catch up. I suspect Apple's play will be this - it will create a product that defines affordable luxury, aimed at its existing customers - those hordes of iPad, iPhone and MacBook users. It won't be a seen as an essential upgrade - you may remember the head-scratching about what the iPad was for when it launched in April 2010 - but it will both exploit and further engender the loyalty of Apple's army of fans. Crucially, it will almost certainly add fitness functionality for tracking recreational exercise, muscling in on the nascent market inhabited by the likes of Fitbit, Jawbone and Nike - whether Apple will partner with the latter, as it has in the past on Nike+ products is uncertain. The iWatch could also monitor your basic health. And of course it will be a playground for app developers, who have shown themselves to be adept at fulfilling Apple products' latent potential. No company has as much experience of transforming the technological marketplace, especially by reinventing existing ideas. Whether Apple can worry the waters of yet another tributary on the River Tech, notably for the first time without Steve ""Midas"" Jobs at the helm, remains to be seen. It could, though, and it will almost certainly try. Benedict Evans, Enders Analysis Apple was hugely disruptive to the music and mobile phone businesses and is now disrupting the PC market with the iPad. Is it going to do the same to the television industry? Making predictions about unannounced Apple products is generally a fool's errand, but there's an obvious issue here - what are you going to watch? Suppose you buy a beautiful new Apple television, take it home and unpack it. If you care about TV and live in the UK, you're most likely to be in the half of homes that have pay TV - and so you plug your Sky or Virgin box into the back, switch over to the Sky or Virgin user-interface so you can actually watch something, and never see anything from Apple ever again. So why did you buy an Apple television? The people who own great programming don't want to give up control of it - Sky wants to give you a Sky experience, not an Apple experience. There's no way for Apple to bypass that without buying content - films, football - itself, and it can't afford to outbid every TV company in every country it would want to sell TVs. When you add to that the fact that televisions are an extremely low-margin business - even Samsung only makes a few percent profit - then a TV looks that much less attractive to Apple. In my view that makes doubling down on the current ""Apple TV"" strategy much more sensible - sell a cheap widget that turns any TV into an Apple TV. Matt Rice, Sennep The original iPhone was unveiled over five years ago now and since then there has been no major top-to-bottom refresh of iOS. With recent hardware updates being more iterative than innovative, the power of the operating system to make a big impact and generate genuine excitement has grown immensely. Now could the be time for a radical overhaul of the user interface (UI) which has the potential to give users something innovative, fresh and inspiring in their hands again. There has been a ground-swell of opinion within the design community against the skeuomorphic direction of Apple's current interface design. The approach of using real-world metaphors to give the user a familiar reference point can work well when treated with restraint and intelligence. However, Apple's increasing use of wood, leather and metal textures has become surprisingly heavy-handed and tacky. The casino environment of Game Center, with its green-felt background and lacquered-wood borders, is a prime example of this questionable execution, and the stark contrast between the design sensibilities of the software and the hardware. With Jony Ive now at the helm of both human interface and industrial design, I expect the two will align. It will be interesting to see how this plays out with the release of iOS 7. It's unlikely that a potential new look and feel will follow the current ""flat-design"" trend, particularly as it is tied so closely to Microsoft's Windows 8. I do think that the overly physical elements of the interface design will be pared back and the gaudy textures will be phased out. While this would establish a refreshed visual direction, the UI will need to retain and build on the good things that have served Apple so well in the past. This perceived tactility is not just about aesthetics but about understandable and satisfying interaction, and is unlikely to be underestimated by the master of product design. I'm looking forward to seeing how the two are balanced under this new stewardship. Elyse Betters, tech writer Apple's vice-president of marketing, Phil Schiller, revealed last August that it had considered making a car or re-entering the camera business before it decided to pursue the iPhone. His comments led many to wonder what else the company pursues behind closed doors. It's tempting to think Apple could make the greatest splash by launching something out of left-field - especially at a time when Samsung has confirmed it is ""working very hard"" on a Galaxy smart-watch, and the market is swamped with smart-TVs. Rumour sites tossing around speculation have suggested Apple might develop an iOS-powered gaming console. The boss of PC games developer Valve, Gabe Newell, threw fresh fuel on those flames in January when he said his industry faced the risk of Apple taking over the living room if others didn't make enough progress. Reports Jony Ive helped design the cartoon robot Eve in Pixar's film Wall-E also suggest the enticing idea he might work on an Apple Android (though Google might take issue with that brand). However, while such speculation is fun, there is one major hitch - chief executive Tim Cook has made it clear that Apple's ""laser focus"" separates it from the competition. ""I think some companies... decided that they could do everything,"" he told NBC in an interview. ""We know we can only do great things a few times, only on a few products."" Steve Jobs trimmed Apple's product line-up to a few core ideas when he returned to the company in 1997. This focus, which Mr Cook seems to share, spurred Apple's innovation and propelled it to global success. If Apple truly wants to stand the test of time, it should continue striving for perfection and avoid becoming a jack-of-all-trades company.",In a short time Apple has gone from Wall Street's darling to its favourite whipping boy.
"By Cristina CriddleTechnology reporter The Silk Road was an online black market, selling everything from drugs to stolen credit card information and murderers-for-hire. It was shut down by the US government in 2013. It's unclear whether the transaction is being made by the owner of Silk Road, law enforcement or hackers. Blockchain trackers Elliptic and Ciphertrace reported that about 69,370 bitcoins were moved from an account believed to originate from the Silk Road. This online wallet is the world's fourth-richest Bitcoin address, according to website BitInfoCharts. Who's responsible? Criminals with access to the wallet could be moving the money - either to cash in the funds or to keep them safe, if the original account was compromised by hackers. But law enforcement agencies may have also accessed the account, either through a hack or with the co-operation of a criminal with access to the wallet. In 2015, Bitcoin seized from a different wallet associated with Silk Road was sold at auction by the US government. The US Department of Justice has been contacted for comment. Dr. Tom Robinson, co-founder of Blockchain analysts Elliptic, detailed the findings and said the account had been dormant since 2015. ""Blockchain analytics shows these funds originated from a wallet linked to the Silk Road back in 2012,"" he told the BBC. Silk Road creator Ross Ulbricht is currently serving two life sentences in prison after being found guilty of money laundering, computer hacking, and conspiracy to traffic narcotics. Moving funds ""The movement of these bitcoins ... may represent Ulbricht or a Silk Road vendor moving their funds,"" Dr Robinson wrote in a post on Elliptic's website. ""However it seems unlikely that Ulbricht would be able to conduct a Bitcoin transaction from prison."" ""There is some speculation that the wallet could have been cracked by hackers,"" Blockchain analysts Ciphertrace said in its report. ""These movements could possibly mean that the wallet owner is moving funds to new addresses to prevent hackers from accessing the wallet.dat file, or that hackers have already cracked the file."" The account has been circulating among hackers trying to break into the wallet since early September, Alon Gal, chief technology officer of cybercrime intelligence company Hudson Rock said. Bitcoin prices have been rising to their highest levels since January 2018, selling above $13,000 (£10,044) since Friday. Prof Alan Woodward, a computer scientist from Surrey University, said it was ""highly likely"" to be either the criminals involved in Silk Road or law enforcement agencies. ""It's been sitting there for such a long time that if the criminals were ever going to cash out they might as well try now,"" he added. ""They know very well it's being watched, but they also know that we live in turbulent times where the authorities have their hands full with major world events. They might be hoping they can slip under the radar."" But David Gerard, author of Attack of the 50 Foot Blockchain said it would be difficult to sell on such a large amount of Bitcoin. ""I'm not sure the crook could cash out now, both because of the size of the stash, and because everyone is watching,"" he said. ""That's the trouble with Bitcoin - if you're going to do drug crimes worth millions of dollars, then you probably shouldn't do them on a permanent immutable public ledger. ""Bitcoin is completely traceable, and everyone can follow the hot bitcoins.""","Almost $1bn (£772m) in Bitcoin linked to the notorious Silk Road website is being transferred, analysts say."
"The regulator said the winning bidder will have to provide the high-speed coverage to current ""not-spot"" areas. It said the measures would help bring fast mobile internet to parts of the country that are underserved. The bidding process for the spectrum is still scheduled for the end of this year, Ofcom said. A 10-week consultation period into the revisions will now begin ahead of Ofcom's final decision on the precise details of the auction. In a statement, Ofcom chief executive Ed Richards said: ""We are proposing a significant enhancement of mobile broadband, extending 4G coverage beyond levels of existing 2G coverage - helping to serve many areas of the UK that have traditionally been underserved by network coverage."" Ofcom had previously proposed that a ""special condition"" be added to oblige the winning bidder to roll out a 4G network to 95% of the UK population. It now said it wants to extend that reach to 98%, by allowing the mobile operator to effectively piggyback already planned government investment into boosting 2G coverage in remote rural areas. Ofcom argues this stipulation will encourage the operator to invest in areas that are of most benefit to the UK. Switchover When the nationwide switchover to digital television is complete, spectrums that are currently being used for analogue transmission will be offered to mobile operators. The 800MHz slice - which has been freed up by the switchover to digital TV - allows mobile signals to travel over greater distances, making it invaluable in the search to find ways of bringing broadband to rural areas. The higher capacity 2.6GHz band will be more useful in towns and cities where lots of users require services. The auction will sell off a huge chunk of available spectrum, equivalent to three-quarters of the mobile spectrum in use today. Ofcom had promised that Three and Everything, Everywhere - a merger of T-Mobile and Orange - would both be guaranteed a space on the 800MHz band, which at present is only being used by Vodafone and O2. That promise is not part of the revised proposal. Ofcom's statement said: ""Because of their current spectrum holdings, and/or the much lower risk that these national wholesalers would fail to acquire further spectrum in the auction, we do not consider it necessary to reserve any spectrum for Everything Everywhere, [O2 owner] Telefonica or Vodafone. ""We therefore think it is appropriate, and so propose to, in effect, reserve some of the available spectrum for a fourth national wholesaler, by which we mean a bidder other than Everything Everywhere, Telefonica or Vodafone."" Ofcom chief executive Ed Richards added: ""This is a crucial step in preparing for the most significant spectrum release in the UK for many years. ""The UK benefits from being of the most competitive mobile phone markets in Europe. ""Ofcom's objective is to promote effective competition and to stimulate both investment and innovation."" 'Disappointed' However, Everything, Everywhere has said it was ""disappointed"" by the decision. A spokesperson said: ""Ofcom is missing a huge opportunity for the UK to address the imbalance in sub 1GHz spectrum holdings, which has damaged consumer interests for the last 20 years - and is a situation which is now threatening to continue. ""The importance of sub 1GHz spectrum, which delivers service and cost benefits, has been recognised by other regulators across Europe and supported by economic analysis."" The reaction from other mobile operators has been largely positive. David Dyson, chief executive of Three, described the measures as ""pragmatic"" in ensuring the ""prospects of a competitive market"". ""We urge Ofcom and the government to maintain momentum now and to ensure the auction is delivered in 2012 as planned,"" he added. A Vodafone spokesperson said: ""We welcome Ofcom's revised proposals, which bring the UK closer to a fair and open auction that will benefit the wider economy, increase competition and ultimately lead to the creation of innovative and exciting new services for consumers. ""Ofcom has produced a lengthy document and we need to understand the regulator's rationale for protecting a fourth operator, but it has made significant steps towards bringing 4G services to this country."" A spokesperson from O2 said: ""As we have said throughout this process, the key objective of the 4G auction should be to ensure that operators are able to exploit the full potential of the spectrum.""","Ofcom has revised proposals for its fourth-generation mobile spectrum auction, adding measures that could bring coverage to 98% of the UK."
"""Indies"" will be able to create their own games, publish to the Xbox when they like, and set their own pricing, the computer giant has confirmed. Microsoft had previously said it would only allow games from recognised publishers on the new console. The Xbox One, the successor to the Xbox 360, is to be launched in November. Announcing the policy change Marc Whiten, corporate vice president of Xbox, said: ""Our vision is that every person can be a creator. That every Xbox One can be used for development. That every game and experience can take advantage of all of the features of Xbox One and Xbox Live. This means self-publishing."" Microsoft plans to make further announcements about self-publishing in August at the Gamescom conference in Cologne, Germany. The self-publishing U-turn is the first major announcement since Don Mattrick, former boss of the Xbox division, left to be head of games maker Zynga in July. Development costs Reacting to the announcement, Will Freeman, editor of Develop, a magazine for the games developer industry, told the BBC: ""This is certainly an exciting move by Microsoft and will help democratise games development. ""But making a game is one thing, getting it played by lots of people is another. What really matters is Microsoft's policy towards distribution."" Barry Meade, commercial director of Fireproof Studios, a British Bafta-award-winning games maker, said: ""This will be great for diversity, good for Microsoft and good for consoles in general. ""There hasn't been enough innovation in the console sector because of the high costs of development."" Fireproof has been highly critical of console makers in the past, principally because of the high costs and bureaucracy involved in creating games for them, preferring to focus on the cheaper mobile and browser platforms. Creating a blockbuster console game from scratch and getting it promoted in stores and online can cost tens of millions of dollars, whereas Fireproof's popular mobile game, The Room, cost up to £80,000, says Mr Meade. Self-publishing Microsoft's original policy contrasted with that of console rival, Sony, which is seen by many developers as more ""indie-friendly"". In May, Sony announced that it would introduce an indie game section in its PlayStation Store and allow self-publishing on the Playstation 4 console, also due for its UK launch in November. In June, Microsoft stopped charging developers for updating their games on the Xbox 360 in a sign that it was responding to criticism from the indie community.","Microsoft is to allow independent games developers to self-publish on its Xbox One games console, in a reversal of its previous policy."
"By Katia MoskvitchTechnology reporter, BBC News Since this super-conductive form of carbon, made from single-atom-thick sheets, was first produced in 2004, it has promised to revolutionise electronics. But until recently, it existed more in the realm of science than technology, with limited production techniques and only theoretical applications. Now a couple of breakthroughs are promising to take graphene out of the lab and into real devices. The first relates to how it is made. Currently graphene is ""grown"" at sweltering temperatures using chemical vapour deposition. ""In the process, a mixture of gases is passed above the catalyst metal - a piece of copper foil or thin nickel film - heated to about 1000C,"" said Dr Daniil Stolyarov, chief technology officer at New York-based Graphene Laboratories. ""Methane molecules decompose on the surface of the metal and release carbon atoms, which then assemble into a graphene film."" The system is complex and relatively low yield. Now researchers at Northern Illinois University (NIU) have found a much easier way to manufacture high volumes of graphene - by burning magnesium in dry ice. The scientists say that the method is simple, faster and greener. Reporting their findings in the Journal of Materials Chemistry, the team revealed that it had managed to produce ""few layer"" graphene, several atoms thick. The NIU discovery happened as a by-product of research into creating carbon nano-tubes. ""It surprised us all,"" said Narayan Hosmane, professor of chemistry and biochemistry. Faster chips The second major breakthrough exciting materials scientists centres on a possible application for graphene. Its conductive properties are well known and it has long been the vision of chip designers to construct graphene-based processors. IBM made early inroads in 2010 when it created a basic graphene transistor. This month, the company announced that it had gone a step further, integrating it into a circuit known as a broadband frequency mixer - an essential component of TVs, mobile phones and radios. ""When a radio station broadcasts at a high frequency through space, the wave is then received by your radio, but the high frequency cannot be heard, so it must be converted into a low frequency wave that we can hear,"" the lead scientist of the project, Dr Phaedon Avouris, told BBC News. IBM calls its research an important milestone for the future of wireless devices. Perhaps more importantly, it demonstrates the capability of graphene integrated circuits. Previously, scientists had experienced difficulty preserving the integrity of the material during the silicon etching process. Getting it to work alongside other chip materials had also proved problematic. ""Our work demonstrates that graphene can be used as practical technology, that it's no longer some individual material,"" said Dr Yu-Ming Lin, one of the scientists on the project. ""This is the first wafer-scale production of graphene-integrated circuit - and we've shown that graphene can be integrated with other elements to form a complete function, which enables higher performance and more complex functionalities in a circuit."" The results appear impressive. In their paper published in the journal Science, the team explained that the circuit could operate at high frequencies of up to 10GHz (10 billion cycles per second), and at temperatures of up to 127°C. Big surprise IBM's work surprised many - even the physicist behind the material's discovery. ""I never suspected we would get there so fast,"" said Dr Konstantin Novoselov of Manchester University. He is the man who, together with a colleague Dr Andre Geim, first produced this highly conductive, extremely strong and transparent material in 2004. The two scientists, both originally from Russia, managed to extract graphene while experimenting with plain old sticky tape and graphite, commonly used in pencils. The pair won the prestigious Nobel Prize for their breakthrough. ""This integrated circuit is a logical step forward, and it's somewhere in the middle between the first experiments and real-life applications,"" said Dr Novoselov. ""But I was surprised to see that someone managed to do it that quickly."" Other applications Electronics giants as well as small labs have been eyeing graphene's future prospects, hungry for smaller, faster, thermally stable and more powerful electronic components. Korea's Samsung has invested heavily into graphene research, and the Finnish firm Nokia has just announced its plans to team up with partners - among them the two Nobel-prize winners - to explore graphene opportunities. Besides electronics, graphene could be used in optics and composite material applications. A number of graphene-based prototypes have already been developed in labs around the world - and it seems that possibilities are almost endless. It has also proven a hit with biologists - as the most transparent, strongest and most conductive material on Earth, graphene could be an ideal candidate for Transmission Electron Microscopy. Samsung has promised to release its first mobile phone with a graphene screen in the near future. Professor Andrea Ferrari of Cambridge University says that besides being totally flexible, a touch screen of a phone or a tablet made of graphene could even give you ""sensational"" feedback. ""We went from physical buttons to touch screens, the next step will be integrating some sensing capabilities,"" says Professor Ferrari. ""Your phone will be able to sense if you're touching it, will sense the environment around - you won't have to press a button to turn it on or off, it will recognise if you're using it or not."" Also, he said, one day we might not need to carry around GPS devices - along with other graphene-based sensors, they could be woven into our clothes. ""Besides GPS, you could have something that will monitor your heart rate for instance - and it'll be integrated into the fabric,"" explains Professor Ferrari. And graphene could even help airplanes ""communicate"" with pilots. The scientist explained that electrical properties of graphene change depending on the strain it is subjected to - like when there are strong winds, for instance. So the casing of the plane would be able to sense if it is under great or small stress, and feedback the information directly to the cockpit, without the need for additional sensors.","Graphene is a ""wonder material"" waiting to happen."
"I had no idea that my H&M beachwear campaign would receive so much publicity. I'm the quiet type who reads books, plays video games, and might be a little too obsessed with her cat. So, suddenly having a large amount of publicity was an awkward surprise at first. I found it strange that people made such a fuss about how my body looks in a bikini, since I don't usually give it much thought. When my Facebook fan page gained about 2,000 new likes in 24 hours, I decided to use the attention as an opportunity to make the world a little nicer by promoting confidence. I've since been receiving lots of messages from fans, expressing gratitude. Some even told me that my confidence has inspired them to try on a bikini for the first time in years. This is exactly the kind of thing I've always wanted to accomplish, showing women that it's OK to be confident even if you're not the popular notion of ""perfect"". This message is especially important for teenage girls. Being a teenage girl is incredibly difficult. They need all the help and support they can get. When our bodies change and we all start to look totally different, we simultaneously begin feeling pressured to look exactly the same. This is an impossible goal to achieve and I wish I had known that when I was 13. At 5ft 9in and a US size eight (usually either a UK 10 or 12), I envied the girls whose boyfriends could pick them up and carry them on their shoulders. Gym class was a nightmare. While the thin girls were wearing shorts, I was wearing sweat pants because my thighs were the size of their waists, and those pants were embarrassingly short because I was taller than the average adult, but still shopped at (pre-teen clothing store) Limited Too. I also had thick, curly hair that only drew more attention to me, hiding behind my braces and beige, wire-rimmed glasses. On top of all this I've always been rather clumsy, so to say that my adolescence was awkward is an understatement. Having finally survived it, I feel compelled to show girls who are going through the same thing that it's acceptable to be different. You will grow out of this awkwardness fabulously. Just focus on being the best possible version of yourself and quit worrying about your thighs, there's nothing wrong with them. After all, I never thought of myself as model material but then I was discovered at a Petsmart, while volunteering in my too-short sweat pants no less. I was given the option to lose weight and try to maintain a size four (a UK six or eight), or to gain a little - maintain a size 10 (a UK 12 or 14) - and start a career as a plus-size model. I knew my body was never meant to be a size four, so I went with plus. People assume ""plus"" equates to fat, which in turn equates to ugly. This is completely absurd because many women who are considered plus-sized are actually in line with the American national average, or a US size 12/14 (somewhere between a UK size 14-18). I can't argue that some styles look better on one size than another. While the idea of separating women into size categories seems stigmatising, clothing companies do this in order to offer their customers exactly what they're looking for, making it easier for people of all sizes to find clothes that fit their bodies as well as their own unique stylistic expression. The only problem is the negative connotations that remain stubbornly attached to the term ""plus-size"". There shouldn't be anything negative about being the same size as the average American woman, or even being a little bigger. Some women are perfectly healthy at a size 16 (a UK 18 or 20). There are also negative connotations associated with thinness. Just as bigger women get called fat or chunky, thin women get called gangly or bony. There's no need to glamorise one body type and slam another. We need to stop this absurd hatred towards bodies for being different sizes. It doesn't help anyone and it's getting old. You can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on Facebook","When H&M hired a ""plus-size"" model to show off the range of sizes for its beachwear, the ad campaign caused much discussion. Model Jennie Runk says it's time we stopped obsessing about size."

"By Jonathan FildesTechnology reporter, BBC News Initially, users only had to move their mouse over a message containing a link - not click it - to open it in the browser. The code was spread by worms, self-replicating, malicious pieces of code. Thousands of users were caught out by the flaw, including Sarah Brown, the wife of the UK's former Prime Minister. ""This issue is now resolved. We apologise to those who may have encountered it,"" wrote Bob Lord, security chief at the firm, in a blog post. ""Users may still see strange retweets in their timelines caused by the exploit. However, we are not aware of any issues related to it that would cause harm to computers or their accounts."" The firm said there was no need for users to change their passwords ""because user account information was not compromised"". People using the mobile web site or third-party Twitter software - such as Tweetdeck - were unaffected by the bug. The flaw comes just one week after Twitter rolled out a major redesign of its site. 'No regrets' The code exploited what is known as a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability, a flaw in a website that can be exploited by relatively simple code. In the case of the most recent incident, the command - written in a programming language called Javascript - automatically directed users to another website, some of which contained pornography. The malicious links looked like a block of colour or a random URL that contained the code ""onmouseover"", which triggered when the cursor hovered over the link. ""Other users took this one step further and added code that caused people to retweet the original Tweet without their knowledge,"" wrote Mr Lord. The first self-replicating code, or worm, seems to have been written by a developer called Magnus Holm. ""I simply wanted to exploit the hole without doing any 'real' harm,"" he told BBC News. ""It started off as 'ha, no way this is going to work'."" He said the flaw had been identified by others and had already been used for other means. ""There were several other tiny hacks using the exploit - I only created the worm,"" he said. Mr Holm said he had seen his worm passed around in at least 200,000 messages. Others soon copied his code using ""other nasty or smart tricks"" he said, including directing people to porn sites. ""It was only a matter of time before more serious worms started."" A Twitter user called Matsta appeared to have spread one variant. Their account has now been suspended. Mr Holm said he had no regrets about his actions and was ""not sure"" whether he would receive a call from Twitter. It is not the first time the service has suffered an attack. In April 2009, another worm spread links to a rival site, again showing unwanted messages on infected user accounts. Graham Cluley, a researcher at security firm Sophos, told BBC News that Twitter needs ""much tighter control"" over what users can put in a tweet to prevent similar problems in the future. He also warned users to continue to be on their guard, as once an exploit had been found there would be a raft of hackers looking for new ones or ways to circumvent the patch. ""We've seen it in the past,"" he said. ""When Twitter says they have fixed a flaw, we see a new exploit again and again.""",Twitter has patched a flaw in its website that was being exploited to pump out pop-up messages and links to porn sites.
"Web hosting company OVH said it had been attacked by a botnet (zombie army) of hacked devices such as webcams. The previous largest attack was thought to be one on security expert Brian Krebs' website which hit 620Gbps (gigabits per second). That was also thought to be mounted via a botnet of compromised smart devices. It is not known whether the attacks were mounted by the same botnet. Both were so-called distributed denial of service attacks - in which websites are hit by massive amounts of data. They have thrown the spotlight once again on the security of IoT (internet of things) devices. Breaking the net According to a recent report on IoT malware from security firm Symantec, cybercriminals are increasingly looking for vulnerable smart devices - such as TVs, home security systems and webcams. ""Cybercriminals are interested in cheap bandwidth to enable bigger attacks. They obtain this by hijacking our devices and stitching together a large web of consumer devices that are easy to infect because they lack sophisticated security,"" said Nick Shaw from Symantec's Norton division. OVH founder Octave Klaba has been tweeting about the ongoing attack, updating followers on the number of devices that are joining the botnet, which at one point including more than 145,000 devices : ""+15,654 new CCTV participated in the DDoS last 48H,"" his last tweet reads. Mr Krebs' website was offline for nearly a week and, according to Akamai - the security firm that supported the site - the attack was nearly double the size of any previous one it had seen and was ""among the biggest assaults the internet has ever witnessed"". Dave Larson, chief technology officer at security firm Corero, said that IoT botnets were disrupting the industry. ""The tools and devices used to execute the attacks are readily available to just about anyone; combining this with almost complete anonymity creates a recipe to break the internet.""",One of the biggest ever web attacks - in which more than one terabit of data was fired at a website to knock it offline - has been reported.
"By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor The entrepreneur said he had spent $10m (£6.4m) on legal costs since being arrested in New Zealand in 2012 and accused of internet piracy. Mr Dotcom had employed a local law firm to fight the US's attempt to extradite him, but his defence team stepped down a fortnight ago without explaining why. Mr Dotcom said he would now represent himself at a bail hearing on Thursday. He denies charges of racketeering, conspiring to commit copyright infringement and money laundering. He told a conference in London, via a video link, that his lawyers had resigned because he had run out of money. ""The [US authorities] have certainly managed to drain my resources and dehydrate me, and without lawyers I am defenceless,"" he told the audience at the Unbound Digital event. ""They used that opportunity to try and get my bail revoked and that's what I'm facing."" The law firm Simpson Grierson, which had represented Mr Dotcom, could not be reached for comment. Political backlash Mr Dotcom's declaration comes seven months after he won back access to about $750,000 worth of property - including several of his cars - that had been taken at the time of his arrest. However, other assets, including dozens of bank accounts, remained frozen. The German national's finances have also been put under strain after he helped bankroll a political party that failed to win a seat in September's general election in New Zealand. ""Before I started my political movement - the Internet Party - I was quite popular in New Zealand,"" Mr Dotcom told the digital business conference. ""After I got involved in politics and the prime minister of New Zealand and his party attacked me viciously, labelling me a Nazi... and [saying] I'm only starting my political party to fight my extradition... New Zealanders unfortunately have bought into that narrative and today I'm a pariah. ""The witch-hunt worked, and everyone wants to see me burn, and next Thursday I might go to jail because of that."" Mr Dotcom does, however, continue to retain a lawyer in the US, who gave an interview to Radio New Zealand after Mr Dotcom's comments. ""There are assets frozen across the globe, there are mechanisms in place for getting relief from those frozen assets - we're hopeful that courts across the globe, including in Hong Kong and New Zealand, will do the right thing and release funds to counsel,"" said Ira Rothken. ""This is the largest copyright case in the history of the United States and New Zealand. It's a very expensive case. And the governments are making this a war of attrition. ""They're trying to outspend Kim Dotcom. They are trying to win on procedure rather than merit. And we're going to do the best that we can so Kim Dotcom has a fair playing field."" He added there were still about 20 lawyers working on the case. Mr Dotcom launched a follow-up online storage company, Mega, in 2013, and in March said it was valued at 210m New Zealand dollars ($164m; £104m). The business is set to be floated on New Zealand's stock exchange later this year. However, he does not directly own a stake in the business himself and is no longer one of its directors. His wife, Mona, does own 16.2% of its shares, but the two are separated. Ms Dotcom revealed in June that she had moved into a guest house about 50m (164ft) away from Mr Dotcom's mansion so their five children could still be close to their father. Mr Dotcom has revealed that his rent is pre-paid until mid-2015 and he plans to return to court ""soon"" to try to unfreeze more of his assets. The next extradition hearing into his case is not scheduled until February 2015, providing him an opportunity to hire more local lawyers if he can obtain the funds. ""Not having legal representation should not prevent an individual from challenging extradition proceedings if he or she has good grounds to do so,"" Neil Smyth, a partner at the law firm Taylor Wessing, told the BBC. ""However, the process is such that having advisers that are experts on not only the law, but also the procedure and the tactics, undoubtedly gives that individual a greater advantage in fighting extradition."" The US Justice Department claims Megaupload made more than $175m before it was closed and cost film, TV and other rights-holders more than $500m.","Kim Dotcom, the founder of the seized file-sharing site Megaupload, has declared himself ""broke""."
"By James ClaytonNorth America technology reporter One accused the Democrats of ""blatant corruption"". Another said: ""Sleepy Joe allowed his campaign to be taken over by the EXTREME RADICAL LEFT"". Biden's team has been removing attack ads since Mr Trump went into hospital. The Democrats don't want to be seen running personal attacks on a sick President. But this is not a ceasefire. Trump's team has continued to run attack ads. One Facebook advert released on Monday said that Biden would ""stand by"" and let mobs ""cause absolute mayhem"". Another which ran on Sunday accused Joe Biden of making it ""difficult for black people"". Another appeared to mock technical difficulties during a Biden live streaming event. This is despite the Trump campaign on Saturday criticising the Biden campaign for not taking down the attack ads quicker. ""Despite pledging to stop his negative advertising, nearly 100 negative Biden ads slandering the president and lying about his record have aired today while the president is at Walter Reed,"" a Trump spokesman told Fox News on Saturday. Biden's team responded by saying it was difficult to remove some of the ads immediately. Almost all of Biden's Facebook ads live right now are related to getting out the vote. Some of the attack ads were paid for by the ""Trump Make America Great Again Committee"" which is run by both the Republican National Committee and his campaign. Others were paid for by ""Donald J Trump for President, Inc"". The refusal to stop running attack ads puts the Democrats in a difficult position. The Biden campaign national press secretary has already said it is ""inappropriate to use the president's illness to score political points"". But Trump may well have symptoms of the illness for days - potentially even weeks - to come. Subdue attacks And with the election just four weeks away, that could tie Biden's hands - forcing him to subdue his attacks on Facebook. Republican analysts believe Trump's use of targeted negative ads on Facebook helped the campaign in 2016.",The Trump campaign on Monday ran a series of attack ads against Joe Biden.
"The company currently updates a public list of ads run by politicians, their campaigns and political parties. But it has decided that sponsored content, posted by influencers and paid for by politicians, will not be included in its library. Presidential hopeful Michael Bloomberg is one candidate to use the technique. Earlier this week, it was revealed that Mr Bloomberg had been paying influencers to post memes about him on Instagram. 'Different from advertising' When a politician pays to ""boost"" a post on their Facebook page, the post is added to a public ad library. It is designed to offer more transparency and show what sort of messages politicians are paying to amplify. Facebook requires influencers and social media stars to indicate when they have been paid to post something on Facebook and Instagram. But these ""organic"" or ""native"" advertisements, written in the influencer's own voice, will not appear in the political ad library, even if a politician has paid for them. Facebook told the BBC: ""Branded content is different from advertising, but in either case, we believe it's important people know when they're seeing paid content on our platforms. ""We're allowing US-based political candidates to work with creators to run this content, provided the political candidates are authorised and the creators disclose any paid partnerships through our branded content tools."" The social media giant launched new policies for political advertising in the US in 2018 and globally the following year. These rules require political ads to display who had paid for them. They place those ads in a publicly searchable database for seven years. Bloomberg Memes Earlier in the week, it was revealed that Democratic presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg has been paying social media influencers for posts in the hope of reaching younger voters. The campaign for the former New York mayor hired influencers though the company Meme2020 to post images that would ""make him look cool"". The new policy will require these types of posts on Facebook and Instagram to include a label that states that they were done in partnership with a political campaign. Facebook's politics and free speech approach Facebook has come under criticism for its policy towards political advertising. Posts by politicians are not always fact-checked as part of the company's free speech policy. But under its new guidelines, posts by influencers will be fact-checked if they are in the voice of the poster and not the candidate. For example, a post that said ""I will vote for candidate X because they can fly"" would be fact-checked. A post that said ""candidate X says 'vote for me because I can fly'"" would not. So far these new policies only apply in the US.","Facebook will not include sponsored political posts by social media stars in its political ad library, the company has confirmed."
"By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter He runs Biobean, a start-up which is gathering waste from coffee chains such as Costa and converting it into liquid fuel. The firm is due to unveil a coffee-run bus in the capital in a few weeks. In London, the need to get cleaner air is vital - the dense road network coupled with high buildings make it one of the most polluted places in the UK. ""We are going through a period of energy divergence where we are moving from a fossil-fuel based society to one that is increasingly diversified. Bio-fuel will be crucial to that,"" said Mr Kay. The biochemical method by which oil is extracted from a pile of coffee grounds is patented but uses a process which evaporates the grounds via something known as hexane extraction. It extracts around 15 to 20% of oil and the remaining mass is turned into bio-mass pellets which can be burnt as fuel in wood burners. And, said Mr Kay, there is always a ready supply of ingredients. ""As long as people are still drinking coffee, there will be coffee waste. ""In the UK, people consume 500,000 tonnes of coffee each year, and if we could use all of it we could power a city such as Manchester,"" he said Lots of countries are starting to see the benefits of bio-fuel, which can be made out of anything from chocolate to sewage. Sweden created some unwanted headlines a few years ago when it used the carcasses of rabbits - being culled due to over-population - to make fuel. But before that, Sweden had a long history of using bio-fuels and in the capital, Stockholm, 15,000 cars - many of which are taxis - and 300 buses are now run on bio-gas. Initially bio-fuel was created from ethanol - which is generated from Brazilian sugar cane - but following concerns in the mid 1990s that this was unsustainable because it was also a food source - the country focused more on bio-gas, made as a by-product of methane in sewage. In order to increase the use of bio-fuel, it converted the city's own vehicles which encouraged petrol stations to introduce bio-fuel pumps. ""Now we are examining new ways to generate bio-gas from food waste,"" said Gustaf Landahl, head of Stockholm's smart cities project. That includes providing households with different coloured bags to allow them to sort organic waste more easily. ""The city air quality is much better now but there are still some streets that have a problem,"" he said. That is due in part to the rise in popularity of diesel cars in recent years and the use of studded tyres, popular in Sweden during the winter months, which can also release pollutants. In 2009 the EU decided that by 2020, 10% of transport in member nations should be powered by renewable energy but since then there has been a backlash about how sustainable some of these sources are. ""There have been concerns about certain bio-fuels, such as ethanol which is generated from corn or rape-seed because they are also edible and so there is a conflict with using the crops for food,"" explained Dr Cecilia Mondelli, a lecturer for the Advanced Catalysis Engineering group at ETH Zurich. Making such material at scale is also problematic because it requires land to grow, added Dr Mondelli. As a result, more attention has been focused on bio-fuel that can be generated from waste products such as coffee grounds. ""Even if you use a waste, this does not ensure that its conversion process has a mild ecologic impact. One needs to take into account other aspects, mainly the energy and chemical auxiliaries required and the waste produced, to estimate the sustainability of the process in a meaningful manner,"" said Dr Mondelli. She believes that bio-fuels will remain ""a fraction of our future energy system"" alongside other sources such as hydrogen, methanol and renewables such as solar. Some cities are choosing more conventional routes to improving air quality with many pursuing policies that favour electric vehicles. Beijing is the latest to announce plans to convert its fleet of 70,000 taxis to electric, starting this year at a cost of around 9 billion yuan. Norway currently boasts the world's highest number of electric cars per capita and in March announced that electric or hybrid cars represented half of new registrations in the country so far this year. Sales of electric cars accounted for more than 17% of new vehicle registrations in January, and hybrid vehicles 33.8%. Cars with combustion engines are heavily taxed in Norway while electric vehicles are exempt from almost all taxes. Owners also get free access to toll roads, ferries and parking at public car parks. Back in London, car-maker Ford is partnering with Transport for London to pilot electric-only vans in the city. The number of commercial vehicles has increased by 12% in cities as more and more people rely on fast deliveries of online goods. ""As cities grow, and London is growing by the equivalent of two full Tube trains every week, there will be a continuation of that trend,"" said Graham Hoare, Ford's chief engineer. It forces city authorities to look for more innovative ways to reduce congestion and improve air quality. Ford's trial will see 20 plug-in hybrid vans on the roads that will complete ""the majority of drives"" in electric mode, with a conventional engine available to take over on longer trips. While electric trucks are not new, what makes this project more radical is the fact the firm will be geo-fencing London - effectively creating walls around the city, within which the vans must drive in full electric mode. Telematics in the vans will allow engineers to reset this function if drivers are found to be emitting CO2 within the zone. ""It is not that we don't trust drivers,"" explained Mr Hoare. ""It is more so we can guarantee the function of the vehicle in certain environments.""",Green entrepreneur Arthur Kay wants the red buses that have become a landmark of London to run on fuel generated by coffee waste.
"By Chris BaraniukTechnology reporter Mike Hearn, a Zurich-based developer and long-time proponent of Bitcoin, surprised many this weekend when he published a blog calling Bitcoin a ""failed"" project. Mr Hearn, who had until recently been working on new software for the currency, says he has now sold all of his own bitcoins and will no longer take part in the crypto-currency's development. So, is Bitcoin doomed? What is Bitcoin? Bitcoin is a crypto-currency - a system of digitally created and traded tokens to which value is assigned. Computers have to solve cryptographic problems in order to add blocks to the blockchain - a ledger that records every transaction that has ever occurred with Bitcoin. In return, those computers receive bitcoins in a process known as bitcoin ""mining"". Users have a ""bitcoin address"", to which bitcoins may be sent or from which they may be used. Addresses are stored online in wallets that function like bank accounts. Although most people refer to Bitcoin as a currency, it is worth noting that for regulatory reasons many countries - including the United States - have decided to define it as a commodity instead. What are the problems? The biggest issue most bitcoin users acknowledge is how quickly new transactions can be processed. The size of blocks being added to the blockchain has been increasing steadily with the rise of Bitcoin. As a result, the rate at which transactions can be processed has been slowing. Indeed, some transactions face significant delays, hampering payments. Some fear the network will eventually become oversaturated and cease to be usable. Who is Mike Hearn? Mike Hearn is a software developer who has worked on Bitcoin technologies for over five years. In 2014, he left his job at Google to focus on Bitcoin full time. He has worked closely with Bitcoin chief scientist Gavin Andresen on alternative software for Bitcoin called Bitcoin XT, which aims to address capacity issues facing the network. Mr Andresen is generally thought of as next in the chain of influence over the currency's development after Bitcoin's mysterious founder, Satoshi Nakamoto. How might the capacity of the network be increased? Currently, each block can be no more than 1MB. But in May last year, Mr Andresen said bigger ones should be adopted. He later wrote, ""It is more likely people [will] just stop using Bitcoin because transaction confirmation becomes increasingly unreliable."" The Bitcoin XT version developed by Mr Hearn, Mr Andresen and others offers to increase the block size limit to 8MB There are alternatives, however. Nic Cary, co-founder of Bitcoin start-up Blockchain, points to BitcoinClassic, which would increase the block size limit to 2MB. Why is there a dispute over this? Bitcoin's history as a ""decentralised"" currency has led to much hesitation over decisions that might change its fundamental nature. Any proposal relating to Bitcoin is likely to encourage fierce debate and, in some cases, stagnation. Some have argued vehemently against Bitcoin XT, causing a deep divide in the community. The New York Times has reported that death threats had even been made against some Bitcoin developers. Mr Cary says the need to update the block size limit is not as urgent as some say. ""This is a matter of perspective,"" he told the BBC. ""The Bitcoin network has been updated safely dozens of times and will continue to be the most reliable, affordable, and efficient way to send value around the world."" However, there are some who feel that Bitcoin's potential as a currency has already been exhausted. ""I'm sure there are smart people right now working out what the next generation [of Bitcoin] should look like but I have to say I'm not convinced that money or payments is the optimum [use] of the technology,"" Dave Birch, a director at consultancy firm Consult Hyperion, told the BBC. Part of the problem was the lack of consensus over what Bitcoin was and how it should be used, he added. How 'healthy' is Bitcoin? Bitcoin's price fell quite sharply over the weekend, following the publication of Mr Hearn's blog. One bitcoin is now worth $380 (£265), down from about $430 on Thursday. However, the price of Bitcoin is notoriously volatile. It has been classed as the best performing currency in the world in 2015. But authors of that analysis, The Money Project, also noted it was the worst performing currency the previous year. Besides price, Bitcoin has also suffered from a litany of cases in which bitcoins have been stolen from online exchanges in which they were stored, in some cases due to negligence or poor security. Such incidents generally result in a complete loss of funds for the victims, since it is very difficult to trace where stolen bitcoins have been transferred. Meanwhile, the currency continues to grow - a sign of good things to come, say many. What will happen next? Bitcoin remains popular. There is still huge interest in developing both the currency and technologies based on the blockchain idea of recording data. It seems unlikely the currency will collapse overnight. But it certainly look as though fundamental questions over how Bitcoin works are now coming to a head. Whether the community that uses and supports Bitcoin will be able to come to a consensus on these matters remains to be seen. Mr Hearn has lost faith in the project, of that there is no doubt. But many others are refusing to throw in the towel just yet. Update: This report was changed on 19 January 2016 to clarify that some payments can take a considerable time to be processed rather than not going through at all.",A high-profile Bitcoin developer has said the crypto-currency has failed and he will no longer take part in its development.

"The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) wants to find out what happens to data on Americans the NSA scoops up. The lawsuit comes three days after a US judge ruled that a separate NSA spying programme was lawful. More details of the NSA's access to phones and networking hardware have been released by privacy campaigners. Hardware hit The lawsuit was filed by the ACLU and Yale University's Media Freedom and Information Access Clinic, and seeks information about the ""vast quantities"" of data that the NSA has been found to be collecting. It was ""inevitable"" that data sent by Americans would be gathered as part of this surveillance system that targets overseas communication, said ACLU staff attorney Alex Abdo in a blog post. The ACLU wants the courts to make the US government provide details of the executive order that established the overseas spying programme. It said that there being little or no oversight of the programme was cause for concern. ""We now know too well that unchecked surveillance authority can lead to dangerous overreach,"" wrote Mr Abdo. In a separate development, New York District Judge William Pauley dismissed on 27 December a lawsuit filed by the ACLU in June, which claimed that the way the NSA tracked million of calls contravened the US constitution. In his ruling, Judge Pauley said there was no evidence that the ""bulk telephony data"" collected by the NSA was used for anything other than ""investigating and disrupting terrorist attacks"". The ACLU said it would appeal against the ruling. The legal wrangles come as privacy campaigner Jacob Applebaum released details of other NSA spying programmes that targeted hardware. In a speech given to the Chaos Communications Congress in Hamburg, Mr Applebaum said the NSA had managed to put back doors into products made by Cisco, Dell, Apple, HP, Huawei and Juniper Networks. ""Basically their goal is to have total surveillance of everything that they are interested in,"" Mr Applebaum told the conference.",The US government is being sued by civil liberties groups for details about the National Security Agency (NSA) overseas surveillance programme.

"The Chromebook Pixel runs Google's Chrome operating system and has been ""largely built"" by the web giant. The laptop has Intel's Ivy Bridge processors, fast 4G LTE connectivity and a high-resolution screen aimed at challenging Apple's Retina Display. Analysts say the move represents a fresh bid to build market share for Chromebooks against machines running Microsoft and Apple operating systems. Unlike PCs that use installed software such as Microsoft Word, Chrome OS computers run their applications through the firm's web browser and store their files in the cloud. The internet giant told the BBC the device was ""largely built by Google, with components that are manufactured globally"". The laptop's 12.85in (32.64cm) display's resolution is similar to the so-called Retina Display of Apple's MacBook range, aimed to have pixel density high enough for the human eye not to notice pixelation when looking at the screen at a typical viewing distance. ""This Chromebook has the highest pixel density (239 pixels per inch) of any laptop screen on the market today,"" said the company. ""Packed with 4.3 million pixels, the display offers sharp text, vivid colours and extra-wide viewing angles. ""With a screen this rich and engaging, you want to reach out and touch it — so we added touch for a more immersive experience."" Embracing the cloud The first Chrome-powered laptop, built by Samsung, went on sale in June 2011. Chrome laptops that followed were made by Acer, Lenovo and HP. But so far, Chromebooks have had difficulties challenging Windows-powered computers, said CCS Insight analyst Geoff Blaber. ""Chromebooks have struggled for relevance to date, stuck between comparably-priced but entertainment-centric tablets - many of which run Android - and more functional PCs,"" he said. ""[The new computer] won't transform its prospects but Google will hope it serves as a flagship device that has a halo effect for the broader portfolio."" Windows 8, Microsoft's latest operating system launched last year, has touchscreen capabilities. Mr Blaber said: ""Touch is now pervasive across every computing category from phones to high-end PCs. ""The challenge for the Chromebook is that computing is shifting towards tablets whilst most consumers lives are not yet fully embracing the cloud versus local storage.""",Google has unveiled its first touchscreen-enabled laptop.
"The software, called Greyball, sought to identify officials trying to catch its drivers and deny them service, the New York Times reports. Uber has frequently been at odds with governments - and with competitors. Greyball was used to secure early access to cities where its operations had not been authorised. In most cases, local officials wanted to make sure the company was subjected to the same conditions of service required by the legislation. The New York Times said existence of the Greyball program was confirmed by four current and former Uber employees, who were not named. Greyball identified regulators posing as ordinary passengers, by collecting data on the location used when ordering a taxi and determining whether this coincided with government offices. It also checked credit card information to establish whether the user is linked to an institution or law enforcement authority. Uber, the report adds, even visited phone shops to trace smartphones bought by city officials setting up multiple accounts in an effort to catch the company's drivers. Once individuals suspected of attempting to entrap drivers were identified, they would be served a ""fake"" version of the Uber app, with fictitious cabs on view, and where they were successful in ordering a real one, they would have their booking cancelled. Local officials contend this is illegal. Read more ""This program denies ride requests to fraudulent users who are violating our terms of service,"" Uber said in a statement.

"The broadcaster's media service was one of the most prominent online platforms to use Flash. Adobe's plug-in has been criticised by some security experts, who said it was a weak point of many sites. Flash use has been decreasing and the move will provide a further blow, but it will not kill off Adobe's product, said one security expert. The BBC announced the decision to move towards HTML5 on Tuesday. In a blogpost, it said it was ""now confident [it could] achieve the playback quality you'd expect from the BBC without using a third-party plug-in"" such as Flash player. Users have been invited to visit a BBC site where they can set a cookie in their browsers that will allow them to access the HTML5 player when they visit iPlayer in future. However, the Flash version will remain available. 'Upgrade' The BBC said it was testing the new player on a range of browsers, including Google Chrome on all platforms, Firefox 41 and Safari on iOS 5 and above. Others chosen for the test are Opera 32, Internet Explorer 11 and Microsoft Edge on Windows 10 and Blackberry OS 10.3.1. The BBC added that it was also going to ""move away from the BBC Media Player app on Android devices"" with users invited to join a limited beta test in the blogpost. ""We've been working for the last few months to upgrade our existing HTML5 player to make it usable on the desktop as well as mobile and tablet,"" wrote James East, the BBC's product manager for media playout. ""We'll be working over the coming months to improve the HTML5 player to match the abilities of our Flash player and to refine the functionality and design based on your feedback."" He said that most video programmes would be available on HTML5 on iPlayer immediately but, for those that took longer to become playable, users would be able to use the old player. Flash Adobe's Flash is one of many plug-ins used to display multimedia content on websites. HTML5, the latest version of the dictionary used by the majority of the worldwide web, incorporates video hosting, where its predecessors did not. The BBC has joined Netflix and other major firms in adopting HTML5 and information from analytics website Built With shows a downward trend in the number using Flash over the last 12 months. The iPlayer, which the BBC said received 250 million TV and radio requests in July this year, was one of the most prominent. However, many of the internet's largest sites still do use Flash, including Amazon, IMDB and the US video site Hulu. Unfair criticism The plug-in has been repeatedly criticised over its security record and, in June this year, Adobe had to release an emergency software patch after a serious vulnerability was found. But the security expert Chris Green said Flash still had an important role to play and was sometimes unfairly maligned.

"Richard Spencer's page on the social network was removed on Friday along with two other pages he controlled: that of his National Policy Institute think tank, and one promoting his AltRight.com news analysis website. Facebook has not commented, but the BBC understands the blocks are permanent. Mr Spencer continues to have active accounts on Twitter and YouTube. Facebook's action follows its decision to expel the anti-Islamic group Britain First and its leaders last month. The US-based technology giant's terms and conditions state that it does not permit ""hate speech"", which it defines as including content that directly attacks people because of their race or ethnicity. Last week, Facebook's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, told Congress that the ""question of what is hate speech versus what is legitimate political speech"" was an issue that he and his team ""struggle with continuously"". Raised arms Mr Spencer has denied being a ""white supremacist"", but has spoken in favour of creating a North American country restricted to white people. He has also said he was proud of slavery, and has described Islam as being a ""black flag"". The 39-year-old has been active in far-right politics for about a decade and claims to have created the phrase ""alternative right"" for a magazine headline. The article's author has said they in fact ""co-created"" the term. However, he rose to prominence in 2016 when he was filmed celebrating President Trump's election victory by shouting: ""Hail Trump, hail our people, hail victory,"" to an audience, some of whom responded with Nazi-like salutes. Mr Spencer was also filmed making a similar gesture at a karaoke bar that same year. He then played a prominent role in 2017's Charlottesville protests, where he opposed the removal of a statue of Confederate leader Robert E Lee. Subsequent speeches at the University of Florida and Michigan State University's campuses sparked protests of their own. Facebook's decision to act now does not appear to have been triggered by a fresh event involving Mr Spencer. Rather, Vice News has suggested that the move was a response to a question it had fielded about why Facebook had not already taken such action. The news site reported that another page belonging to the far-right Nationalist Initiative had also been blocked. Twitter briefly suspended Mr Spencer in 2016, but said it had done so only because he had run multiple accounts.","Facebook has banned the American white nationalist who popularised the term ""alternative right""."
"Most of the accounts were posing as Democrats, the social media company said. They were taken down in late September and early October. Twitter was alerted to the accounts by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC). The DCCC launched the effort this year following the party's failure to respond to widespread false and negative information on social media about Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election, Reuters reported. Twitter believes that the network of now-deleted accounts was run from the US, CNN reported. The DCCC is reported to be working with contractors to identify misinformation campaigns. Last month the state of California signed legislation that bans the use of undeclared bots during elections. The bill would make it illegal to use the bots to influence voting.","Twitter has deleted an estimated 10,000 automated accounts that were posting messages discouraging people from taking part in next week's US mid-term elections."
"By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor The disclosure follows a report by Gizmodo, which said the artificial intelligence tech was being used to analyse drone footage. The news site said that many of the search giant's workers only learned of the collaboration last week via internal emails. It added that some were ""outraged"". A spokeswoman for Google said that the tie-up involved the provision of software tools to let the US Department of Defense (DoD) make use of its TensorFlow machine learning code. ""The technology flags images for human review, and is for non-offensive uses only,"" she added. ""Military use of machine learning naturally raises valid concerns. ""We're actively discussing this important topic internally and with others as we continue to develop policies and safeguards around the development and use of our machine learning technologies."" Although Google's former chairman Eric Schmidt became an advisor to the Pentagon in 2016, the firm has otherwise been cautious about being linked to the US military. It previously pulled one of its robots from a Pentagon-organised competition, despite it being the favourite to win, in part because of such concerns. Data glut Gizmodo identified the drone initiative involved as being Project Maven - a scheme announced last July to use computer algorithms to identify objects of concern from ""massive amounts of moving or still imagery"". The idea is to focus human efforts on sections of footage flagged for further analysis and avoid them having them having to wade through all the other hours of recorded material. The DoD said that its immediate focus would be 38 classes of objects related to the fight against the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria. ""There is no 'black box' that delivers the AI system the government needs, at least not now,"" said Colonel Drew Cukor at the time. ""The only way to do that is with commercial partners alongside us."" Google declined to discuss its involvement further. But the BBC understands that the algorithms it has shared were not designed for face detection, but were instead developed to identify generic objects including cars, birds and trees. It is believed that they are not being used to fly or otherwise operate the drones themselves. Google is not the only US firm to be involved. Chip-maker Nvidia has previously blogged about Project Maven and is also understood to be working with the DoD on the effort. One expert said the relatively cheap cost of operating drones such as the MQ-1 Predator and MQ-9 Reaper had led to a glut of video material. ""The vast quantities of data produced by the US Air Force and CIA - as well as allies like the UK who operate these [drones] in conflict zones like Iraq and Afghanistan - have long outstripped the processing and exploitation capacity of the traditional human-centric intelligence processing organisations within these countries,"" commented Justin Bronk, a research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute think tank. ""As a leading developer of AI technology, Google is an obvious choice for the DoD to partner with, albeit one whose employees and shareholders might be less than 100% enthusiastic about the prospect of working with the military."" Mr Bronk added that the UK's Royal Air Force had an even more acute shortage of imagery intelligence analysts, and would probably wish to share access to Google's AI tech if that became possible. The BBC has asked the Ministry of Defence for comment.",Google has confirmed that it is allowing the Pentagon to use some of its image recognition technologies as part of a military project.
"By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor The UK's communications watchdog Ofcom aims to help users avoid overpaying. It said more than 20 million people have stuck with subscriptions beyond their lock-in, often without realising. And those that opt not to move to another package need to be reminded they can still do so on a yearly basis. The watchdog first announced its plan to help people secure end-of-contract deals in July 2018. Relevant companies have nine months to update their systems and must start sending out the notifications from 15 February 2020. Service providers will need to text, email or send a letter to their consumers between 10 to 40 days before their contracts come to an end saying: ""This will put power in the hands of millions of people who're paying more than necessary when they're no longer tied to a contract,"" said Lindsey Fussell, Ofcom's consumer group director. About 14% of customers do not know whether or not they are still tied to their current contracts, according to research commissioned by the regulator. It added that customers can typically cut the cost of a bundle of the services involved by about 20% if they sign up to a new deal rather than remain on a contract beyond its minimum period, However, some consumer rights organisations still have concerns the measures do not go far enough. During the consultation, Citizens Advice had told Ofcom that it believed providers should be made to send out more than one notification to each customer and that the companies should also be made to disclose how many of their subscribers are out-of-contract and how much extra on average they are paying compared to in-contract users. ""Almost nine in 10 people think that charging loyal customers more is unfair, and we agree,"" commented Gillian Guy, Citizens Advice's chief executive. ""We look forward to hearing about the concrete actions Ofcom will take to end this systematic scam."" A trade group has also raised concern that small internet providers that specialise in serving business customers might struggle with the cost and complexity of adapting their systems to meet the rules. ""[The Internet Services Providers' Association] is concerned at the lack of clarity around small business customers... as it does not seem to take into account the scale and nature of this market,"" said a spokesman for the organisation. ""We hope that Ofcom will address this going forward.""","Broadband, pay-TV, mobile phone and landline customers must be told when their contracts are about to end and be informed of their providers' best alternative deals, under new rules."
"By Dave LeeNorth America technology reporter The @CCHQPress account - the Tory press office - was renamed ""factcheckUK"" for Tuesday's live TV debate involving Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn. After the debate, the account reverted to its original branding. Twitter said it would take ""decisive corrective action"" if a similar stunt was attempted again. But the firm does not appear to have taken any action over this particular incident. ""Twitter is committed to facilitating healthy debate throughout the UK general election,"" a spokesperson said. ""We have global rules in place that prohibit behaviour that can mislead people, including those with verified accounts. Any further attempts to mislead people by editing verified profile information - in a manner seen during the UK Election Debate - will result in decisive corrective action."" The Tories were earlier criticised by genuine fact-checking agency Full Fact, which said in a statement: ""It is inappropriate and misleading for the Conservative press office to rename their twitter account 'factcheckUK' during this debate. ""Please do not mistake it for an independent fact checking service such as FullFact, FactCheck or FactCheckNI."" Conservative Party chairman James Cleverly defended the rebranding. He told BBC Newsnight: ""The Twitter handle of the CCHQ press office remained CCHQPress, so it's clear the nature of the site."" Mr Cleverly added the decision to rebrand the account would have been made by the party's digital team, which he said operated within his remit. He said he was ""absolutely comfortable"" with the party ""calling out when the Labour Party put what they know to be complete fabrications in the public domain"". Reacting to the decision, the Labour Party tweeted: ""The Conservatives' laughable attempt to dupe those watching the #ITVDebate by renaming their twitter account shows you can't trust a word they say."" The Liberal Democrats, meanwhile, said the ploy was ""straight out of Donald Trump or Putin's playbook"", adding the Tories were ""deliberately misleading the public"". Twitter is a minority interest. Journalists are over-represented on this platform compared to other social media, creating a profound danger that they misinterpret what happens on Twitter as representative of the wider world. Nevertheless, an important threshold has now been repeatedly breached by Britain's party of government, and Twitter is the site where it happened. It is perhaps arguable that, like the doctored video of Sir Keir Starmer a fortnight ago, the re-branding of CCHQ as a fact-checking service falls into the broad category known as satire. But that is a stretch. The effect will have been to dupe many unknowing members of the public, who genuinely thought it was a fact-checking service when it gave opinions on Jeremy Corbyn. This is not to patronise voters, who are wise; rather, it is to recognise that in a world of information overload, what cuts through are stunts. Which is why, ironically, in CCHQ this morning there will be younger staff who chalk this up as a victory. Journalists thus face a dilemma: call out disinformation, and you play to the worst of social media, distracting from questions of policy; but ignore it, and the truth recedes ever further from view. Twitter has policies regarding deceptive behaviour on the platform. The company said it can remove an account’s “verified” status if the account owner is said to be “intentionally misleading people on Twitter by changing one's display name or bio”. Other users on the platform subsequently changed their display names to mock the move. Among them, writer Charlie Brooker, who tweeted: “We have always been at war with Eastasia”, a reference to George Orwell’s dystopian novel, Nineteen Eighty-Four. This latest controversial move on social media comes less than a month after the Conservative Party was criticised for posting a ""doctored"" video involving Labour's Sir Keir Starmer, in which the shadow Brexit secretary was made to look as if he met a question, posed by ITV's Piers Morgan, with silence. Conservative Party chairman James Cleverly said the video, since taken down, was meant to be ""light-hearted"". The party later posted an extended version of the interview. Full Fact, which is a charity supported by donations from the likes of Google, described the incident as ""irresponsible"".",Social networking site Twitter has said the Conservative Party misled the public when it rebranded one of its Twitter accounts.
"The campaign was organised by Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian. It urges people to phone the watchdog and oppose it allowing telecom firms to charge for prioritised data delivery. The Federal Communications Commission's five-member board will decide whether to proceed with drafted guidelines on Thursday. Ahead of the vote, the FCC's senior lawyer hosted a Twitter chat in which she provided further details about the draft document being considered, which has not yet been made public. Gigi Sohn tweeted that the document ""asks if paid prioritization should be banned outright & seeks comment on best ways 2 protect innovators"". She added that the public would be given 60 days to comment on the proposals, and a further 60 to reply to others' posts before the FCC made a final decision. But critics fear that the ""open internet"" proposals will fail to prevent the broadband firms charging content providers for a premium data transmission option. ""[They will] kill the idea of net neutrality and replace it with a 'cable-ised' version that costs more for consumers, enables discrimination across services that make use of the net, and makes it harder to access the stuff that we access each day today (from video streaming to file saving and sharing),"" wrote Mr Ohanian. ""On top of all that, it'd have a chilling effect on entrepreneurship - all for the benefit of a few cable companies."" Social media campaign The adverts have been placed at 30 bus stops in the US capital after a fundraising effort on Crowdtilt's website raised more than $21,000 (£12,520). Electronic versions of the ad are also being shared across social media. However, Mr Ohanian was not able to achieve his original plan to place the ad on a billboard ""right in the FCC's backyard"" - mirroring a similar tactic mounted against the author of a controversial anti-piracy law. The FCC denies it is deliberately trying to destroy the principle of net neutrality but argues that it needs to clarify regulations after a court ruling earlier this year. The US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia sided with telecoms firm Verizon in January after the firm challenged the FCC's previous instruction that broadband providers must treat all traffic equally. Since then both Verizon and Comcast, another cable firm, have begun charging Netflix for direct access to their networks to ensure that its TV shows and movies are delivered at high speeds to avoid the problem of buffering. ""Right now there r no rules 2 protect open internet,"" tweeted Ms Sohn during the Twitter chat. ""Chairman wants 2 ensure all Americans can get unfettered access 2 the content & application they want."" Regulation dilemma The FCC's chairman, Tom Wheeler, added that one ""viable option"" being considered was to have broadband internet access reclassified as a Title II ""telecommunications service"" rather than its current status as an ""information service"". Doing so would potentially allow the regulator to block priority-access deals. However, telecoms industry leaders have questioned whether the FCC has the power to do this, and warned of negative consequences. ""America's economic future... critically depends on continued investment and innovation in our broadband infrastructure and app economy to drive improvements in health care, education and energy,"" 28 of the industry's leaders wrote in a letter to the watchdog. ""Under Title II, new service offerings, options, and features would be delayed or altogether foregone. ""An era of differentiation, innovation, and experimentation would be replaced with a series of 'Government may I?' requests from American entrepreneurs."" Mr Wheeler has said another option would be to try to block deals that were not ""commercially viable"" by making reference to a section of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. However, the Save The Internet Campaign - supported by Mr Ohanian - suggests that this tactic would be destined to fail. ""If and when the FCC tried to prevent bad deals, the agency would lose again in court,"" it said. ""The revisions to Wheeler's [earlier] draft are encouraging on one level. They show that the chairman is trying to respond to the massive protests against his proposal. He just isn't listening closely enough.""",Crowdfunded ads that aim to put pressure on a US regulator before it proposes new net neutrality rules have appeared in Washington DC.
"By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter Talks between BT and regulator Ofcom to find a voluntary solution to the problem seem to have broken down. Ofcom has now begun the formal process of forcing a legal split. The big question is what will it all mean for consumers. Why do the two need to split? The argument for separation centres around whether the firm that provides the vast majority of the UK's broadband infrastructure (Openreach) should be part of the same parent group as one of the UK's leading internet service provides (BT). Rivals have long argued that this is bad for competition and the consumer. TalkTalk's Dido Harding was one of the first to welcome Ofcom's new tough stance: ""Openreach has been letting consumers down for far too long, unable to meet promises of even minor improvements and becoming a household name for all the wrong reasons."" Ofcom agrees and, now too, does the government: ""We've been clear that we need a more independent Openreach. It needs to offer genuinely fair and equal access to the country's telecoms infrastructure to BT's competitors,"" said a spokesman for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. This is the best way to ensure consumers get the service they need, and the country gets the digital infrastructure it needs,"" he added. I live in a rural broadband notspot - how would a split improve life for me? Slow and non-existent broadband is still an issue in remote areas and most agree that is unacceptable in an age where telecoms are as important as gas, electricity and water. Openreach has been criticised for the slow rollout of rural broadband and for failing to offer radical new technologies. But, on the flipside, there are no large queues of other operators lining up to fix the problem, which is expensive and technically challenging. The Countryside and Landowners' Alliance pointed out that any split must make sure that the work Openreach is doing to close the digital divide can continue unhindered. ""Any formal break between BT and Openreach must not lose sight of the goal to deliver broadband to rural areas. Ofcom must make it clear that the conditions of the separation include guarantees for future investment to further support rural digital connectivity,"" it said in a statement. Will a split lead to better, cheaper broadband? What consumers really need, according to Andrew Ferguson, founder of the broadband news website ThinkBroadband, is ""fibre to the home with gigabit speeds for £20 to £35 per month"". Fibre-to-the-home technology offers faster speeds than the majority of current broadband connections, which are known as ""fibre to the cabinet"", meaning the final connection to homes is delivered over slower copper wire. Mr Ferguson told the BBC that no-one currently knows whether a legal separation will deliver this faster option. ""The split has the potential to be very transformational and start the UK down a path of 95% fibre-to-the-premises coverage in 10 years, but that was a possibility yesterday too. The key is whether the split means more money will be available and if a fibre-to-the-premises (home) product is adopted by operators like Sky and TalkTalk,"" he said. ""The hope is that by reducing the influence of BT Group on Openreach, it would be likely to invest more in faster broadband technology that allows more providers, such as Sky and TalkTalk as well as BT, to offer a better service to their customers."" But, he added, there is a counter-argument that an independent Openreach could create ""a stock market that gets jittery which means that Openreach is starved of capital and struggles to meet what its critics have said are already unambitious rollout targets"". Most agree that a separation of BT and Openreach would not alone solve the UK's broadband problems. Richard Neudegg, head of regulation at uSwitch, said: ""Ofcom needs to act across the board to ensure competition and service improvements. This includes universal service obligations, quality of service requirements on regulated products and automatic compensation when providers fail to deliver. Some believe that the real problem with the UK's broadband is that the copper network simply does not offer the bandwidth and reliability to support our increasingly data-rich needs. Founder of Mimosa Networks, Jaime Fink thinks it is time to consider other technologies: ""Openreach and other UK service providers must change their approach and look at new technologies that can profitably deliver a superfast sustainable broadband network."" He pointed to the US where new entrants such as Google and Facebook have shaken up the market with fixed wireless solutions, which are less expensive than fibre. Will a split improve customer service? You have a broadband fault but it is taking weeks to fix. Sound familiar? One of the biggest arguments in favour of a split is that Openreach has just not provided adequate levels of customer service. Critics say this is because it is not a customer-facing firm so all complaints are channelled via a customer's ISP, giving it no incentive to get on with repairs. ""Millions of people have suffered woeful levels of service from Openreach, so these reforms must lead to significant improvements for customers who have been let down for too long,"" said Which's Alex Neill, managing director of Home and Legal. But will a separation deliver this? It may depend on how the separation looks, thinks Ovum analyst Matthew Howett. ""The improvements in quality and availability of service that Ofcom hopes legal separation will bring about will likely to be delivered much sooner if BT can get on and deliver them today as a result of a voluntary agreement, rather than wait for a lengthy and uncertain process to run its course at the EU level,"" he told the BBC. In order to start the legal separation, Ofcom must now prepare a formal notification to the European Commission to start the process. Mr Howett believes that the door is still open for a voluntary agreement from BT. ""In many ways that would be a better outcome than a forced legal separation, not least because the EU route is uncertain, untested and likely to take much longer to achieve. It is also of course made more complex by the decision from Britain to leave the EU.""",It is one of the most dragged-out divorces in corporate history but it seems that BT and Openreach will definitely go their separate ways.

"Dave LeeNorth America technology reporter In its ever-escalating war against connectivity ports, Apple’s latest computers do away with the SD card port, a full-size USB port, and the HDMI port. Instead, you’ll need a dongle to convert those “legacy” connectors, as Apple put it on Friday, into the new, smaller USB-C port. ""We recognize that many users, especially pros, rely on legacy connectors to get work done today and they face a transition,” the company said in a statement, without acknowledging that Apple’s newest iPhone, released just last month, is one such “legacy” device - without a dongle (or a different cable, sold separately), you can’t connect Apple’s new smartphone to Apple’s new laptop. “We want to help them move to the latest technology and peripherals, as well as accelerate the growth of this new ecosystem."" That help will be a decent discount on the price of the dongles - it calls them adapters - until the end of this year. The most popular one is likely to be the USB to USB-C adapter - which will be $9, down from $19. For connecting iPhones (both new and old), you’ll need a $19 Lightning to USB dongle - although you could use an old Lightning to USB cable if you bought the USB to USB-C adapter. Keeping up? Dongle spaghetti It’s an acknowledgement that Apple’s pro users aren’t exactly thrilled with the latest offering from the company considered to offer the gold standard in laptops. The bigger issue here, and one that was expertly discussed in a Medium post by technology journalist Owen Williams, is what many see as a muddle at the heart of Apple’s newest products. For a company that rightly prides itself on creating products that “just work”, it’s literally descended into something of a tangled mess. Apple has, Mr Williams argued, created computers that lack a core selling point. For pro users, the types that use their Macs for graphic design and video editing, the new range only serves to take away functionality existing Macbooks provide. If you’re not a pro user, that’s fine. But along with Apple’s announcement of new hardware came the news that the prices were going up. Dramatically so, if you’re living in Brexit Britain. (Though Apple certainly isn’t alone there. Marmite, anyone?) Those factors combined mean the dongle issue, one Apple might have got away with in the past, has caused added frustration to the faithful who had been waiting for a serious Macbook upgrade for some time. Dongles get lost, forgotten and broken. They’re an added source of vulnerability when it comes to things accidentally being pulled out when uploading some data, corrupting the lot. The Macbook future, at least for a short while, is a rag-tag spaghetti junction of dongles strewn across a desk or stuffed into a bag. In offices around the world, inboxes will fill with passive aggressive requests for “whoever took my iPhone dongle” to “please put it back where you found it, no questions asked”. And when something doesn’t work, you’ll now need to ascertain: is it the device that’s broken? Or the cable? Or the port? Or the dongle? Competitors moving in But hold up. Apple has form here, and history mostly proves them right. Where Apple goes, others normally follow. Earlier Macbook models already did away with ethernet ports and the CD/DVD drive - a move which seemed absurd at the time, but I’d argue Apple was ultimately exonerated. When was the last time you put a CD into your computer? So in time, the accessories we use every day will become USB-C as standard, no question about that, and the dongles will no longer be needed. But in the short term, Apple is left with a product that that no longer caters to either end of the market. Data suggests schools, parents and bosses are looking to Google’s cheaper Chromebooks, which this year began outselling MacBooks. And if we’re looking at MacBooks as being as part of the bigger Apple planet, we’re left with a company that appears to be behind in many areas. Its iPhone is still king, but sales have been in decline. Apple doesn’t have any virtual reality hardware. It doesn’t have any augmented reality hardware. Or a car - autonomous, electric or otherwise. In artificial intelligence, Apple's Siri is considered to be the least smart of the mainstream smart assistants, and unlike Google and Amazon, it can’t yet be found in a family-friendly home device. Tim Cook appears to be throwing money at the problem(s). Spending on research and development has ballooned in the past three years, though Mr Cook is staying typically mum about what exactly the company is working on - only to tell worried investors that his company has the ""strongest pipeline that we've ever had and we're really confident about the things in it”. Only an idiot would write off Apple and its future. I don’t intend to be that idiot. Apple wasn’t the first to market with the smartphone, not even close, but it went on to define the industry and produce the most profitable piece of technology ever made. It could do that again and again in these new areas. As the world’s richest company, it has time and resources on its side. But with that in mind, couldn’t it afford to pop a dongle or two in the box to make its present-day customers a little happier? Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC and on Facebook",A tweet posted shortly after Apple’s recent Macbook launch event underlined the absurdity: Apple now sells 17 different types of dongle.
"The Uber car struck and killed pedestrian Elaine Herzberg, 49, of Tempe, Arizona in March. The police report suggests the car's driver was streaming an episode of talent show The Voice rather than monitoring the car's progress. It suggests she could face charges of vehicle manslaughter. No action The Tempe police report said the crash was ""entirely avoidable"" if the Uber operator, Rafaela Vasquez, had been watching the road while the car was operating autonomously. County prosecutors have received a copy of the police report, which was released on 21 June following a freedom of information request. In its experiments with driverless cars, Uber has mandated that a human operator pays attention at all times so they can take over in difficult situations or when the vehicle encounters a situation it does not know how to handle. Ms Vasquez looked up from her phone screen about 0.5 seconds before the crash, said the report, but had been concentrating on her phone for about 5.3 seconds previously. At the time, the driverless Volvo car was travelling at 44mph (70km/h). In a statement, Uber said it was ""cooperating fully"" with the continuing investigations while it did its own internal safety review. It added: ""We have a strict policy prohibiting mobile device usage for anyone operating our self-driving vehicles. We plan to share more on the changes we'll make to our program soon."" The Tempe police report comes less than a month after a preliminary investigation into the crash was released by the US National Transportation Safety Board. This revealed the Uber car had about six seconds to react after spotting Ms Herzberg crossing the road in the dark ahead of it. The car ""failed"" to identify Ms Herzberg as a pedestrian, it found, and took no action to avoid hitting her nor did it perform an emergency stop.","The ""safety operator"" of a self-driving Uber car was watching TV just before the vehicle was involved in a fatal collision, a police report reveals."
"The case centred on a claim the iPhone maker should have licensed a feature that lets its handsets ignore touches when held close to users' heads. Google had acquired the contested patent as part of its $12.5bn (£8.2bn) takeover of Motorola Mobility. Apple could have faced an import ban on its mobiles had it lost. Although Apple is based in the US, it outsources production of its mobiles to factories in China and Brazil making them vulnerable to such a challenge. Dropped claims Motorola accused Apple of infringing six of its inventions when it launched the case in October 2010, 10 months before Google announced it was buying the Motorola division. Since then, the US's International Trade Commission has ruled three of the complaints were illegitimate and Motorola willingly dropped another two. The Google-owned division briefly pursued a further seven claims against Apple in a separate complaint filed with the ITC in August 2012, but it dropped the case without explanation two months later. The ITC dismissed the final outstanding claim on Tuesday after accepting Apple's argument that the sensor technology used to touch-protect its phones was ""obvious"" bearing in mind other earlier efforts by tech firms to tackle the problem of accidental dialling. Although the latest ruling brings to an end the firms' legal clashes at the ITC, Google has the right to challenge the agency's judgement at the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. ""We're disappointed with this outcome and are evaluating our options,"" said a spokesman for the Android software developer. Apple declined to comment. Overvalued patents? Google has always said the Motorola acquisition was more about the value of the firm's patents rather than its desire to get into the mobile hardware business. ""Motorola Mobility's patent portfolio will help protect the Android ecosystem,"" it said in a press release. ""Android, which is open-source software, is vital to competition in the mobile device space, ensuring hardware manufacturers, mobile phone carriers, applications developers and consumers all have choice."" Since completing the deal, Google has pursued cases against Apple and Microsoft in the European and US courts. Success would strengthen its negotiating position to challenge its rivals' own infringement claims against individual manufacturers that make Android devices. Google's most notable success was forcing Apple to suspend its push email service in Germany, but when it subsequently attempted to challenge Microsoft's use of the same message-synchronisation technology, a UK judge ruled the patent at the heart of the case was invalid. One legal expert suggested Google's legal tussles demonstrated how difficult it was to value its acquired assets. ""Patents are hugely difficult things - they have to be novel and inventive over what other people have done before,"" Vicki Salmon, chair of the UK's Chartered Institute of Patent Attorneys' litigation committee, told the BBC. ""We are finding in Europe that a lot of the patents granted in the information, technology and communications space prove not to be valid when tested in court. ""When we look at some of the values that the patent portfolios went for in recent years, they were just extraordinary. Were they really worth that much? I'm not too sure. ""Although we are seeing the public fights and tend to notice the big wins and losses, we may not publically see the real value... there may be other licensing deals happening in private which we don't know about and which may be returning some value on those portfolios.""",Google has failed in its latest attempt to convince a US trade agency that Apple has infringed its intellectual property.
"The German chancellor joined Instagram in early June and has posted more than 50 pictures to the account. Many of the pictures have attracted comments in Russian criticising her and praising Russian leader Vladimir Putin.

Others warned that Russians would ""soon be in Berlin again"". Since then, almost every image posted by Mrs Merkel's office of her in meetings and summits has attracted comments in Russian criticising her and her policies. An image of the chancellor talking to Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko won many abusive comments. The only positive comments in Russian were added to an image featuring Russian President Vladimir Putin. People leaving comments called him a ""great man"" and the ""best president"". Staff in Mrs Merkel's office have been deleting comments but some remain despite the purge. Many people re-posted their comments once the originals were removed. The deluge of comments comes soon after Radio Free Europe and the New York Times revealed that Russia has created at least one ""troll factory"" that employs people to push pro-Kremlin propaganda and hoaxes via social media in Russia and elsewhere. Some of the 400 or so people employed at the agency also attack people critical of the Russian government.",Russian trolls are targeting Angela Merkel's newly created Instagram account with hostile and critical comments.
"Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent@BBCRoryCJon Twitter Kickstarter responded in a creative way - by commissioning an investigative journalist to find out what went wrong. Now his report has been published. Mark Harris, a technology writer based in Seattle, travelled to South Wales, spent six weeks speaking to as many people as he could reach and produced an epic account of the history of the Zano. In more than 13,000 words he describes the origins of the Torquing Group, a business that was essentially the personal mission of self-taught engineer Ivan Reedman to build a marketable drone; how clever - though misleading - marketing turned the Zano into a Kickstarter sensation, galloping past its original funding target; and then the disaster which unfolded as Reedman and his colleagues discovered they just did not have the skills or the experience to mass produce the mini-drone. It is the backers for whom this work was designed and many of them will be hoping for a smoking gun to reinforce their belief that the whole project was just a scam to get them to part with their money. They will be disappointed. Mr Harris concludes that this was case of foul-up, not foul play. ""Torquing's directors managed their business poorly and spent the Kickstarter money too freely, but I've found no evidence that any of them ended up rich on the backs of the crowd,"" concluded Harris. He does raise serious questions about the video which excited so much interest in the project. Reedman denies that CGI, other drones or even selfie sticks were used to create a misleading picture of what the Zano could do but admits that the video shows features that were not operational at the time it was shot. In fact, as I found when I came to shoot a demo of the project last August, the Zano never delivered what was promised in the video. But it was not only potential backers who swallowed exaggerations in the marketing campaign. Kickstarter chose Zano as a ""staff pick"" and the tech news site Engadget shortlisted it for its best of CES 2015 award, even though the Torquing team could not demonstrate the drone flying at the show. As late as October, Popular Science chose it as one of its 100 most amazing innovations of 2015. The writer does not accuse the Torquing team of dishonesty but says that as production problems mounted and the money began to run out they showed ""a dangerous lack of self-awareness of the problems the company was making for itself"". Harris has only managed to speak on the record to Reedman, but he concludes that neither he nor the other members of the team ""possessed the technical or commercial competencies necessary to deliver the Zano as specified in the original campaign"". But the most significant lessons to be drawn from his account are for Kickstarter. The crowdfunding platform, which paid for his work, was allowed to look at the finished article before publication but not to change anything. He says all crowdfunding platforms need to reconsider the way they deal with projects involving complex hardware, massive overfunding, or large sums of money. He wants them to look at bringing in mentors to advise projects like Zano which suddenly find themselves taking on far more than they had planned. He also wants Kickstarter to be far more explicit about the nature of the risk backers are taking - and more active in weeding out weak projects before they are funded. Harris interviewed Kickstarter's co-founder Yancey Strickler and though he appears to find a few of the suggestions helpful, he is robust in rejecting most of the criticisms. He says that while the platform does have rules about realistic videos showing a genuine prototype, they are hard to enforce. Tightening up the rules can only go so far, he argues, and it is essential for backers to understand that it is up to them to evaluate a project. ""If you want 100% success with hardware and new products, I think the only solution is that you just shop on Amazon,"" he adds. And in the end, Harris seems to agree. If we want an alternative to banks and venture capital as a funding source for high-risk tech start-ups, he says, we may have to accept the occasional Zano alongside the Pebbles and Oculus Rifts. Now, some of the thousands of people who lost money backing this doomed project will look cynically at a piece of journalism funded by the very organisation they see as partly responsible for their losses. But what Harris - and Kickstarter - have produced is a valuable contribution to our understanding of the risky nature of any technology hardware start-up.","When Europe's biggest Kickstarter project, the Zano mini-drone, crashed to earth last November there was plenty of blame to go round. But many of the 12,000 backers - who had put in £2.3m and ended up with nothing - had angry words for the crowdfunding platform."
"Some of the models duped by the owners and operators of the GirlsDoPorn website had become suicidal, he said. They were told the videos were for a private collector or overseas DVDs, according to the 181-page judgement. The women - aged 18-23 when they shot the videos - were also assured the videos would never appear online. But they were uploaded to GirlsDoPorn's subscription-based amateur porn website, and clips were shared on some of the world's most popular free-to-view adult websites. San Diego Superior Court Judge Kevin Enright ordered GirlsDoPorn chief executive Michael Pratt, 36, videographer Matthew Wolfe, 37, and porn actor Ruben Garcia, 31, to take the videos down from GirlsDoPorn and take steps to get them removed from other sites too. GirlsDoPorn markets itself on the premise that the women in the videos are not professional porn stars. 'One-time-only' It claims to feature women filming their first and only porn videos, and many of the women on the site are students in need of extra money, according to court documents. Due to the one-time-only amateur paradigm, GirlsDoPorn required a constant stream of new models to keep the content on the website fresh. The San Diego court ruled that the site used fraudulent practices to recruit new models including taking ""calculated steps to falsely assure prospective models that their videos will never be posted online, come to light in the United States, or be seen by anyone who might known them"". The website operators had also assured models that their real names would never be linked to the videos. However, the court heard evidence that the accused had shared private and identifying information about the models on third-party forums that resulted in some of them and their families, being harassed online. Complex contracts In a bid to recruit new talent, GirlsDoPorn persuaded former models to text words of reassurance to prospective models who were worried that the videos might be posted online. On the day of the shoot, models were often given alcohol and cannabis before being asked to sign an eight-page contract. Judge Enright awarded the 22 women $9.48m in compensatory damages and $3.3m in punitive damages. Each woman will receive $300,000 to $550,000. He said that the videos had become common knowledge to the women's friends and family due to the tactics used by those behind GirlsDoPorn. ""As a result, plaintiffs have suffered and continue to suffer far-reaching and often tragic consequences,"" he wrote. ""Collectively, they have experienced severe harassment, emotional and psychological trauma, and reputational harm; lost jobs, academic and professional opportunities and family and personal relationships; and had their lives derailed and uprooted,"" he continued. ""They have become pariahs in their communities. Several plaintiffs have become suicidal."" Judge Enright gave both sides 15 days to appeal against his decision. 'My heart just wept' The defendants also face criminal charges filed in federal court in October. The allegations filed against them are the same as those in the civil case. Wolfe and Garcia are currently in federal custody. Pratt is a fugitive believed to be in New Zealand, his home country. ""Our clients were real,"" said Ed Chaplin, the lawyer representing the women, according to CourtHouseNews. ""They had similar stories because the defendants told the same lies to everyone,"" he said. ""I sat and talked to a lot of women. My heart just wept for them, how their lives have been impacted by this and how they were sucked into doing what they did. ""The attitude these defendants expressed when the women complained [and] the scheme to shut them up was despicable."" CourtHouseNews reported that lawyers for GirlsDoPorn declined to comment when approached.","A US judge has awarded $12.8m (£9.8m) to 22 unnamed women, ruling that they were tricked into appearing in widely distributed online porn videos."
"By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter So what help is available? How many laptops has the government provided? As of 31 January, the government has delivered 927,689 laptops and tablets as part of its bid to get more than a million devices to schools and colleges during the Covid-19 crisis. Its calculations are based on the number of children entitled to free school meals. Schools requiring devices for their pupils have to place orders via the Get Help with Technology scheme. Devices are being made available to: According to Ofcom, between 1.1 million and 1.8 million children do not have access to a laptop, desktop or tablet at home, which suggests the government scheme may not be enough. Some private firms and charities are hoping to fill this gap. The London Grid for Learning (LGFL) has a scheme called Bridge the Divide, which is leading a nationwide procurement scheme for two million cheap Chromebooks and WinBooks. The Good Things Foundation's Connecting Families programme delivered 1,870 devices, connectivity and support to families between August and December 2020. In some cases though, demand for devices is outstripping the supply. One academy in Norwich ordered 60 iPads in the summer but has not yet received any. What are mobile providers doing to help? More than 880,000 children live in a household with only a mobile internet connection, according to the regulator Ofcom, and many of these connections include a limited monthly data allowance. During the first lockdown, the Child Poverty Action Group reported that many parents were burning though their mobile allowance to support their children's learning. This time, mobile operators have promised to zero-rate certain educational sites. So far EE, BT Mobile, Plusnet Mobile, Virgin Mobile, O2, Three and Vodafone have said the online materials provided by the Oak National Academy educational website will be free to access until schools reopen, although only BT has confirmed a start date - the end of January. The concession only applies to content published on the Oak National Academy website itself. Some of its videos are also available on YouTube, but firms cannot offer free access to those without zero-rating all of YouTube, which would seriously damage their business models. BT, Plusnet and EE are also offering free access to BBC Bitesize resources. BT has asked the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish administrations to each suggest one additional online resource for children in its regions, which it will zero-rate as well. But Vodafone has said that it does not think it is feasible to ring-fence BBC Bitesize content, and has expressed scepticism that other companies will be able to do it. There are also strict rules - known as net neutrality - which state that providers should treat all internet traffic equally, although Ofcom is expected to waive this requirement given the circumstances. Hundreds of other educational apps and online resources will continue to cost money to access, so the Department for Education has also agreed with mobile operators that schools and local authorities can request free mobile data increases for some of its families. Meanwhile, Vodafone is giving 350,000 free data Sim cards to disadvantaged children. Can people get other help with broadband costs? According to the Office of National Statistics, only 51% of households earning £6,000-£10,000 have home internet access compared to 99% of households with an income of more than £40,000. As part of its wider Lockdown Learning programme, BT is offering a £10 monthly fixed broadband tariff for low-income families called BT Basic. Meanwhile, superfast provider Hyperoptic - which operates in cities such as London, Leeds and Newcastle - is offering free full-fibre broadband (50mbps) for the rest of the school year to households that are able to get its network. It hopes to connect at least 2,500 families, and says there will be no obligation to keep the service once the free contract expires. Virgin is giving more than a million customers who pay for speeds under 100MBps a free boost to higher speeds during lockdown. Can I donate a laptop? A number of charities and groups are collecting unwanted laptops and tablets for schoolchildren to use at home. Many schools are accepting equipment directly, but local BBC radio stations are also helping to coordinate donations by liaising with organisations across the UK. The BBC's Make A Difference: Give A Laptop campaign has seen 17,645 devices donated since 7 January with a further 30,000 devices pledged by businesses across England. In addition, £700,535 has been donated to the campaign.","Home-schooling can be impossible for families who do not have internet devices, or a reliable broadband connection, especially when several people need to be online at the same time."
"That has left many of its 1.5 billion users wondering how safe the ""simple and secure"" messaging app really is. On Wednesday, chip-maker Intel confirmed that new problems discovered with some of its processors could reveal secret information to attacks. How trustworthy are apps and devices? Was WhatsApp's encryption broken? No. Messages on WhatsApp are end-to-end encrypted, meaning they are scrambled when they leave the sender's device. The messages can be decrypted by the recipient's device only. That means law enforcement, service providers and cyber-criminals cannot read any messages they intercept as they travel across the internet. However, there are some caveats. Messages can be read before they are encrypted or after they are decrypted. That means any spyware dropped on the phone by an attacker could read the messages. On Tuesday, news site Bloomberg published an opinion article calling WhatsApp's encryption ""pointless"", given the security breach. However, that viewpoint has been widely ridiculed by cyber-security experts. ""I don't think it's helpful to say end-to-end encryption is pointless just because a vulnerability is occasionally found,"" said Dr Jessica Barker from the cyber-security company Cygenta. ""Encryption is a good thing that does offer us protection in most cases."" Cyber-security is often a game of cat and mouse. End-to-end encryption makes it much harder for attackers to read messages, even if they do eventually find a way to access some of them. What about back-ups? WhatsApp gives the option to back up chats to Google Drive or iCloud but those back-up copies are not protected by the end-to-end encryption. An attacker could access old chats if they broke into a cloud storage account. Of course, even if users decide not to back up chats, the people they message may still upload a copy to their cloud storage. Should people stop using WhatsApp? Ultimately, any app could contain a security vulnerability that leaves a phone open to attackers. WhatsApp is owned by Facebook, which typically issues software fixes quickly. Of course, even large companies can make mistakes and Facebook has had its share of data and privacy breaches over the years. There is no guarantee a rival chat app would not experience a similar security lapse. At least, following the disclosure of this flaw, WhatsApp is slightly more secure than it was a week ago. Some rival chat apps are open-source projects, which means anybody can look at the code powering the app and suggest improvements. ""Open-source software has its value in that it be can tested more widely but it doesn't necessarily mean it's more secure,"" said Dr Barker. ""Vulnerabilities can still be found with any tech, so it's not the answer to our prayers."" And if someone did decide to switch to a rival chat app, they would still have to convince their contacts to do the same. A chat app without friends is not much use. Is any device ever safe? In theory, any device or service could be hacked. In fact, security researchers often joyfully pile in on companies that claim their products are ""unhackable"". They quickly discover vulnerabilities and the embarrassed companies retract their claims. If people are worried data may be stolen from their computer, one option is to ""air gap"" the device: disconnect it from the internet entirely. That stops remote hackers accessing the machine - but even an air gap would not stop an attacker with physical access to the device. Dr Barker stressed the importance of installing software updates for apps and operating systems. ""WhatsApp pushed out an update and consumers might not have realised that security fixes are often included in updates,"" she told BBC News. WhatsApp did not help the cause, however, by describing the latest update as adding ""full-size stickers"", and not mentioning the security breach. ""People need to be made aware that updates are really important. The quicker we can update our apps, the more secure we are,"" said Dr Barker. As always, there are simple security steps to remember:",WhatsApp has confirmed that a security flaw in the app let attackers install spy software on their targets' smartphones.
"The UK's most senior military officer has warned that these cables should be protected as a priority in the face of a new threat posed by Russia. Air Chief Marshal Sir Stuart Peach said it would be an ""immediately and potentially catastrophic"" hit to the economy if they were cut or disrupted. There are approximately 428 submarine cables, running 683,508 miles (1.1m km) around the globe providing internet and communications links. Such networks can become overloaded if major failures occur - particularly if so-called ""pinch points"" are hit by natural disasters. The port of Alexandria in Egypt - at the centre of the map above - is often at risk from ships dropping anchor and severing cables - putting strain on connections between Europe, Africa and Asia. .","Hundreds of thousands of miles of undersea cables circle the globe, providing internet and communications links between nations and continents."
"Called Daniel's Hosting, the site was sitting on the hidden Tor network and many people used it to host pages they did not want to publish on the wider web. Administrator Daniel Winzen said no back-ups were kept of the pages it hosted. He said the site should be back in service in December. ""Around 6,500 hidden services were hosted on the server,"" wrote Mr Winzen in a message put on the welcome page of the web companion to the site. ""There is no way to recover from this breach, all data is gone."" Tor, or The Onion Router, is a way of organising web-like pages so it is hard to work out where the information is located and who is running them. Web pages sited on the Tor network get a .onion suffix. The Tor browser also lets people browse the web in a way that conceals their location and obscures their identity. Daniel's Hosting became one of the most popular sites for .onion site owners after the previously biggest host went offline in early 2017. Daniel's hosted a very wide variety of material including fan fiction, political tracts, philosophy books, porn, hacked files, videos, web marketplaces, crypto-cash forums and places where whistleblowers could leave documents. Mr Winzen told the BBC that he was still trying to work out how hackers had accessed the site on 15 November, when all the data was deleted. ""As of now, I haven't found the vulnerability,"" he said. The prime candidate is a newly discovered vulnerability in PHP - a computer scripting language used for website development - that was being circulated in some hacker circles shortly before Danwin was attacked. However, Mr Winzen told ZDNet that he was not sure that this was the route the hackers took to gain access. When the site returns, he said he would take the chance to change ""some bad design choices of the past"" and improve how it runs. It is also not clear who broke into Daniel's Hosting or why the data was deleted. The Anonymous hacking collective has been behind takedowns of other dark web hosts but, so far, there is no sign of that group's involvement in this attack.","Hackers have deleted more than 6,500 sites being held on a popular dark web server."
"By Dave LeeTechnology reporter, BBC News Promobay.org had been blocked by ISPs due to its close ties with the torrent-sharing site which contained links to download pirated content. The Promo Bay does not contain any links itself and rights campaigners said it should therefore be accessible. On Wednesday the UK's music industry body told ISPs to unblock the site. The British Phonographic Industry (BPI), which won the court blocking order, wrote to the Open Rights Group (ORG) to inform them of the change of heart. ""Until very recently, the domain name 'promobay.org' linked directly to The Pirate Bay and it was therefore a domain name blocked by the ISPs under the court orders,"" wrote BPI chairman Geoff Taylor. ""The newly reinvented Promobay.org website appears not to be engaged in copyright infringement and we therefore asked the relevant ISPs yesterday to no longer block it."" The BPI could not be reached for further comment on Wednesday, but the BBC understands that Promobay.org will be made available again within 24 hours. Legal alternatives The decision follows pressure from both open internet campaigners and ISPs. A petition was launched to gather signatures against the blocking. The BBC understands that Virgin Media wrote to the BPI earlier this week to request they ""review the reason"" for blocking the site. In a further statement, Virgin Media said: ""Promobay.org had been included on the list of URLs Virgin Media is required to block under UK law following the ruling of the High Court against the Pirate Bay. ""As a responsible ISP, Virgin Media complies with court orders addressed to the company but strongly believes compelling legal alternatives are needed to give consumers access to great content at the right price."" The Promo Bay was among a group of sites named in a successful High Court order in April that forced the UK's major ISPs into preventing its users from accessing The Pirate Bay. As a side project, the Promo Bay site was set up to help independent artists publicise their work. Artists could submit their own material - the best of which would be featured on the Pirate Bay homepage in a manner similar to that of Google with its Doodles concept.",UK internet service providers (ISPs) have been told they no longer have to block a website which had close links to banned site The Pirate Bay.
"Dave LeeNorth America technology reporter Project Aquila, first announced in 2014, failed to achieve the long flight times managed by airborne connectivity efforts from rivals including Google. In one test, Facebook’s craft suffered a broken wing as it came in to land. On Tuesday the company said it would instead partner with firms such as Airbus to continue its efforts to connect more people to the internet. The decision means the closure of a facility in Bridgwater, UK, that had been used to build the technology. “It's been exciting to see leading companies in the aerospace industry start investing in this technology too - including the design and construction of new high-altitude aircraft,” wrote Yael Maguire, Facebook’s Director of Engineering, in a blog post. ""Given these developments, we've decided not to design or build our own aircraft any longer.” The Project Aquila craft had the wingspan of a Boeing 737 and weighed the same as a typical family car. It was solar-powered during the day and battery-powered at night, and in testing managed 90 minutes in the air. However, Facebook's efforts paled in comparison to Project Loon, a similar idea using high-altitude balloons rather than drones. It is being worked on by X, the experimental arm of Google parent company Alphabet. Project Loon balloons have flown more than 15 million miles of tests, the company has said, with the longest continuous flight lasting almost 190 days. In 2017, the balloons were used by residents of hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico. _______ Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC Do you have more information about this or any other technology story?

"This follows a Reuters report that Google threatened to remove developers' software from its store unless they accepted payments exclusively using its own payment service. Google told the BBC its app distribution agreement had always made developers use Google Wallet. But the internet search giant refused to say if it has started enforcing its payment rules more rigorously. The story emerged just days after Android Market was merged into Google Play, an online store similar to Apple's iTunes. It offers music, movies and music as well as apps for its Android mobile phone operating system. Todd Hooper, chief executive of Seattle-based Zipline Games, said that Google appeared to be changing its approach to payments. ""On Android it used to be laissez faire - you could use any payment provider you liked,"" he said. ""It's probably naive of developers to think they could keep choosing different payment providers."" Reuters reported that several developers that offered payment methods such as Paypal, Zong and Boku had been warned that their apps faced removal from Android Market. An email sent by Google in August to a developer and obtained by Reuters said the developer had 30 days to comply, otherwise the developer's apps would be ""suspended"" from the market. System 'benefits' Unlike Apple, Google does not vet every app before it is made available for sale in its app store. That means that Google can normally enforce its policy after an app has appeared in the store. Apple has taken a far stricter approach to app payments, insisting that all purchases are made using its iTunes payment system, including purchases of ebooks and magazine subscriptions. ""This is one of the things that has helped Apple succeed,"" said Charles Hudson of Bionic Panda Games, a San Francisco-based games company. ""Every single developer is using the Apple payment system. Google sees the benefits that provides for the Apple platform and wants to create a similar system."" Research in Motion, which makes Blackberry phones, allows multiple payment methods for apps sold in its Blackberry App World. Google only permits alternative payment services for certain types of ""in-app"" transactions made using apps sold in its store. These include purchases of physical goods or digital content such as ebooks or movies. These exceptions allow retailers such as Amazon to sell their goods from within their own apps without having to pay a cut to Google. Developers are still free to sell applications using any payment methods that they want from alternative sites such as their own web-based stores.",Google says it has made no changes to its Android Market payment policies.
"By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor The health secretary Matt Hancock announced the move at the government's daily pandemic press briefing. He said the NHS was ""working closely with the world's leading tech companies"" on the initiative. But one expert who has advised the effort has raised doubts about it. The BBC has learned that NHSX - the health service's digital innovation unit - will test a pre-release version of the software with families at a secure location in the North of England next week. At present, the idea is that people who have self-diagnosed as having coronavirus will be able to declare their status in the app. The software will then send the equivalent of a yellow alert to any other users who they have recently been close to for an extended period of time. If a medical test confirms that the original user is indeed infected, then a stronger warning - effectively a red alert - will be sent instead, signalling that the other users should go into quarantine. To report testing positive, the user would have to enter a verification code, which they would have received alongside their Covid-19 status. Mr Hancock signalled that using the app would be voluntary, in the brief comments he made about it. ""If you become unwell with the symptoms of coronavirus, you can securely tell this new NHS app,"" he explained. ""And the app will then send an alert anonymously to other app users that you've been in significant contact with over the past few days, even before you had symptoms, so that they know and can act accordingly. ""All data will be handled according to the highest ethical and security standards, and would only be used for NHS care and research. ""And we won't hold it any longer than is needed."" His reference to a tie-up with tech companies was a nod to Apple and Google, which announced on Friday that they were working on a software building block, known as an API, to make it easier for others to build contact tracing apps. NHSX was not aware of this project beforehand, but now plans to integrate the technology into its own product. Its system will keep track of handsets that came close to each other by recording when they detected each others' Bluetooth signals. One benefit of using Apple and Google's API is that the NHS app will not have to employ workarounds to keep monitoring the signals even when the app is not active. Part of the reason Apple and Google say they developed their own idea was to ensure that iOS and Android users' privacy would not be compromised. Their method is designed so that citizens can trigger and receive alerts without the authorities being notified of who was involved. But one cyber-security expert who has been consulted about the app listed a series of worries about the project in a blog. The University of Cambridge's Prof Ross Anderson: ""I recognise the overwhelming force of the public-health arguments for a centralised system, but I also have 25 years' experience of the NHS being incompetent at developing systems and repeatedly breaking their privacy promises when they do manage to collect some data of value to somebody else,"" added the professor of security engineering. ""I'm really uneasy about collecting lots of lightly-anonymised data in a system that becomes integrated into a whole-of-government response to the pandemic. We might never get rid of it."" The Behavioural Insights Team - a private company also known as the Nudge Unit - is advising the government on how to encourage as many people to download and use the app as possible. NHSX believes more than half the population going outside needs to be using it for automated contact tracing to be effective.",The UK has confirmed plans for an app that will warn users if they have recently been in close proximity to someone suspected to be infected with the coronavirus.
"The improvised weapons consist of a plastic tube attached to a consumer camera drone to carry explosives. The images were taken by former US Army special forces officer Mitch Utterback, who was in the country as a journalist. Last week a US Army commander said so-called Islamic State fighters were using such weapons as they tried to avoid losing control of the city. ""It's not as if it is a large, armed UAV [unmanned aerial vehicle] that is dropping munitions from the wings - but literally, a very small quadcopter that drops a small munition in a somewhat imprecise manner,"" said Col Brett Sylvia. Islamic State has previously used drones to record footage for propaganda videos and for aerial surveillance, as well as creating improvised weapons. In October, two Kurdish Peshmerga fighters were killed in northern Iraq when a modified drone exploded. Many off-the-shelf drones can fly for up to half an hour, have a range of several miles and retail for less than £1,000. making them affordable for militant groups. ""The group is known for turning things they can get hold of into weapons,"" said Justin Bronk, a research fellow at the UK military think tank Rusi. ""While it shows innovation, the main threat from drones is far and away the ability to hover a camera drone and adjust aim of more direct weapons."" Mr Utterback told the BBC the devices' electronics had been modified to release grenades. ""We saw these every day. The Iraqi forces are very concerned with them,"" he said. Drones can be difficult to shoot down, but new weapons are being developed to tackle them. Some aim to disable to devices by blocking the radio signals they require to be controlled. ""Commercial drones tend to operate in the 2.4 gigahertz range, they are relatively easy to jam,"" said Mr Bronk. ""They are difficult to spot and shoot down, but if you have jamming capabilities you can deny them airspace."" Mr Utterback said the Iraqi forces he had been visiting had had some success shooting down the drones. ""When spotted, every rifle and man-carried machine gun opens up to try and shoot them down,"" he told the BBC. ""Almost half the time, they are successful.""","Photos taken in Mosul, Iraq, appear to show grenade-dropping drones used against the Iraqi security forces."
"By Joe MillerTechnology reporter The site, where members answer questions posed by others, has been linked to teenage suicides in the UK and elsewhere and has been criticised for not doing enough to prevent cyberbullying. IAC, the US company behind the deal, said it would invest ""millions"" into improving safety on the site. Ask.fm's founders will leave the firm. The New York state attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, announced a safety agreement with the new owners. ""Under the terms of the agreement, Ask.fm will revamp its safety policies and procedures,"" his office said in a statement. It said Ask.fm had committed to dealing with user complaints within 24 hours and removing users that have been the subject of multiple complaints. ""An independent safety and security examiner will be appointed to examine the changes and report on compliance to the Attorney General's Office for three years,"" the statement added. Public criticism The company was started in 2010 by two Latvian brothers, Ilja and Mark Terebin. It now boasts 180 million monthly users - almost two-thirds the size of rivals Twitter - with roughly 700 posts made each second. The site, which is very popular among young adults, came under fire last summer following the suicide of 14-year-old Hannah Smith, when it was claimed that abusive comments seen on Ask.fm had contributed to her death. Similar stories soon surfaced, and the Riga-based firm was heavily criticised for not adequately policing its site. It has also been denounced for hosting pages belonging to Islamic extremists fighting in Syria and Iraq, who had used Ask.fm as a recruiting tool. June 2010 December 2011 September 2012 August 2013 August 2013 August 2013 September 2013 February 2014 June 2010 Ask.fm is set up by brothers Ilja and Mark Terebin as a rival to question and answer based social network Formspring. December 2011 Privacy settings introduced to Ask.fm, including the option to disable anonymous questions. September 2013 Ciara Pugsley, 15, is found dead in woodland near her home in County Leitrim, Ireland. This was the first of several teen suicides linked to abuse via ask fm. August 2013 Hannah Smith, 14, is found hanged at her home in Lutterworth, Leicestershire. It is believed she killed herself after she was bullied on the site. August 2013 Prime Minister David Cameron urges people to boycott sites which do not 'step up to the plate' and tackle online abuse. He said that after the 'absolutely tragic' death of Hannah Smith, those running the websites had to 'clean up their act'. 19 August 2013 Changes made to make Ask.fm safer in the wake of online bullying cases. It said it would view all reports within 24 hours, make the report button more visible, and include bullying and harassment as a category for a report. September 2013 In the 2013 Annual Cyberbullying Survey by charity Ditch the Label, Ask.fm is named as one of the three most likely places teenagers experience cyberbullying, alongside Facebook and Twitter. February 2014 Ask.fm launches a 'Safety Center' containing advice and guidance for users of the site and their parents. The network's new owners, IAC, say they are committed to improving child safety and will pour millions of dollars into hiring more moderators and installing better detection systems. ""We wouldn't be getting involved if we didn't think we could make it safer,"" said Doug Leeds, chief executive of Ask.com, the IAC subsidiary behind the deal. Analysis, Rory Cellan-Jones, technology correspondent Why would anyone want to buy a brand as toxic as Ask.fm? It's probably best known - among adults at least - as the social network that David Cameron wanted to see boycotted over cyberbullying. I understand that Ask.com first got interested in the site when it started legal action to protect its own brand from contamination. Then the US firm and its parent group saw just how big and engaged an audience the Latvia-based network had, and began to wonder about a different course of action. Now the new owners need to move quickly to prove they can to make Ask.fm a safe place for its young users without annoying them so much that they head elsewhere. What they have is the financial firepower which the buccaneering Latvian founders lacked - it's just that much easier to build and grow a web business in the United States than in Europe. Mr Leeds added that under new leadership, Ask.fm would pledge to deal with safety complaints within 24 hours. The site would do so by expanding the existing team of 60 staff, he said. IAC has also recruited Annie Mullins, a member of the UK government's task force on child protection on the internet, to help improve safety at Ask.fm, as well as Catherine Davis Teitelbaum, who previously worked on safety policy at Yahoo. Ask.com, known as Ask Jeeves in the UK, is owned by the New York firm InterActiveCorp, also known as IAC. IAC owns several popular internet brands, including: In making the deal, Ask.com has joined forces with the venture capitalists (VCs) behind Ask.fm, who retain a minority stake in the firm. ""Our intentions for the company aligned with the VC's,"" said Mr Leeds. The founders, who operated under what Mr Leeds terms a ""philosophy that's different than ours"" have been effectively bought out, and will no longer be involved with Ask.fm ""They had a laissez-faire, libertarian attitude,"" Mr Leeds added, emphasising that under the new regime, threats of violence and other distressing content would ""not be welcome"".",The controversial social network Ask.fm has been bought by the owners of Tinder and Ask.com for an undisclosed fee.
"Advertising data firm Semrush analysed 25,000 pages for the study. It looked at 1,000 results for 25 search terms including laptop, watches, speakers and smoke detectors on Google. Products sold by Google's parent firm Alphabet dominated the top of the results. Google said it had strict rules for buying its advertising space. A spokesman said that the firm's marketing policies were ""consciously and carefully designed"" so as not to intervene with ad pricing. ""All our bids are excluded from the auction when determining the price paid by other advertisers and we have strict rules and processes - set to tougher levels than our customers - to govern the use of our own ads products,"" he said. The Wall Street Journal reported that in all 1,000 searches for the term ""laptop"" in the study, the top result was for Google's Chromebook. Additionally 98% of searches for ""watches"" resulted in links to Android smartwatch retailers appearing on top. Android and Chromebook are both owned by Alphabet. It also noted that alarm products by another Alphabet firm, Nest, featured highly in searches for smoke detectors. The paper added that after sharing the results with Google many of the ads disappeared - and a BBC test found that other brands including Apple, Lenovo and Apollo now appear to dominate the top of results pages for these terms. In July 2016 the European Commission alleged that Google had abused its dominance in internet shopping and restricted competition - which the firm denied. 'Algorithmic world' ""We think when we look at the screen that Google is placing its ads above others but advertising doesn't work in that way,"" said Daniel Knapp, senior analyst at IHS. ""It may be that Google is willing to pay more than others or that it has better targeting data for identifying users. The method of the [Wall Street Journal] experiment may also be flawed."" The advertising auctions are automated and run by algorithms, he added. ""We live in an algorithmic world. How are these algorithms making decisions on our behalf and how is that distorting markets and society in general?"" he said. ""This is an example of a much bigger underlying issue.""","Adverts for Google products occupied 91% of the top ad slots on the firm's search results pages, in a study done for the Wall Street Journal."
"Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent@BBCRoryCJon Twitter E-sports, where game play is watched by audiences in stadiums and on TV, have been big business in the Far East for more than a decade. But now, as I found out in a report for Friday's World at One on Radio 4, the phenomenon is really taking off in Britain. If UK e-sports have an Alex Ferguson equivalent then it's Michael O'Dell - but then as the owner and manager of Team Dignitas he's also the sport's Roman Abramovich. O'Dell was once a semi-professional games player himself, then built a team of 58 professional players based around the world. ""It's gone from playing in our bedrooms, earning twenty quid in a tournament - and we were happy - to now where we could be earning a million dollars in a tournament, and that's not just one a year, there are a lot of tournaments with a lot of prize money."" On top of that, the team has lucrative sponsorship and merchandise deals. He still lives in a modest home in Surrey with an office in the back garden from where he keeps tabs on his players. We watched as his star player Michael Santana - a gaming celebrity who goes by the name ""Imaqtpie"" - talked his fans through a session of League of Legends from the Team Dignitas Los Angeles base. Streaming on Twitch TV he had attracted an audience of more than 14,000 fans just to watch him practice. Even between tournaments, that earns Imaqtpie a lot of money, upwards of ten thousand pounds a month just from the adverts that appear on his Twitch channel. It is the huge popularity of San Francisco based Twitch, recently acquired by the online retailer Amazon, that has helped fuel the growth of esports around the world. The service allows anyone, amateur or professional, to become a broadcaster, talking to their friends or a global audience as they play games. Jon ""Carnage"" - his streaming name on Twitch - started as just one performer on the channel and is now director of content. He says it is changing television:""For so many years TV has just been one-sided where you view a show as opposed to being a part of a show. Twitch bridges that gap between you and the host - you can talk directly to them."" I caught up with Mr Carnage at London's EGX games show, where Twitch had a sizeable operation. In another corner of the Earl's Court exhibition centre I came across a rather smaller business which hopes to be Britain's biggest e-sports promoter. Gfinity had put on a more modest League of Legends contest than the one taking place in Seoul, with amateur teams and a couple of commentators trying to whip up some excitement amongst the small crowd of onlookers. But Neville Upton, who runs Gfinity, says the potential in the UK is massive: ""You've got 16 million people playing games. What's interesting is that they're not just playing, they like watching as well. We had over eight million watching online during our recent tournament at the Copper Box on the Olympic Park."" And for the first time teenage gamers in the UK are wondering whether they might make careers as professional gamers. The latest signing at Team Dignitas is 17-year-old James ""Greensheep"" Luo from Blackpool. Michael O'Dell spotted him playing a relatively new game called Hearthstone and winning a tournament in Europe. As I watch James playing on his Twitch channel (in front of a tiny crowd compared to those watching Imaqtpie) a sign pops up saying $100 (£62) has been donated. Michael O'Dell explains that well-wishers often donate money to favourite gamers just to show their appreciation of their talent. James isn't making a living from games yet - in fact he's still at school and puts in hours of practice after finishing his homework. ""I just practice, practice practice, learn more about the game and try to get better,"" he tells me. ""I think every gamer's ambition is to make this their full time job. I guess that's my dream as well."" British players are yet to join the e-sports elite who can earn millions. But who knows - maybe in a few years time someone like James Luo will be competing in an e-sports World Cup final in front of a huge global audience. That may be far-fetched - then again it might be more likely than seeing our footballers make it to a final.","Next weekend, the World Cup Final takes place in Seoul in front of 60,000 spectators and a huge global TV audience. No, I'm not confused and this is not football. The contest in question pits Korea's Samsung White against China's Star Horn Royal Club and what they are playing is a video game called League of Legends."
"By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor With many reviews focusing on how long models last between charges, manufacturers are trying to pack in more powerful batteries or find other ways to extend their life. Recently released models have abandoned the built-in cameras found in Samsung's original devices. Instead heart-rate monitors and ambient light sensors - which adjust the screen's brightness - are becoming preferred components. There are still several operating systems powering the tech, but many of the leading manufacturers have opted to release watches powered by Google's new Android Wear operating system over recent weeks, suggesting it will become at least one of the dominant options.","As the number of smartwatches on the market continues to grow, a few things are becoming clear."
"The firm said the problem affected customers in all 29 of the states in which it offered broadband connections. The problem started in the early hours of Wednesday morning, which will have limited its effect. The company said that most, but not all, of its 11.4 million internet subscribers were back online within four hours of the problem's start. ""Unfortunately, I do not have an estimate time of repair,"" the service's Twitter account responded to one user who asked when his home connection would be restored. ""During an overnight network maintenance activity in which we were managing IP [internet protocol] addresses, an erroneous configuration was propagated throughout our national backbone, resulting in a network outage,"" explained a company spokesman. ""We immediately identified and corrected the root cause of the issue and restored service by 07.30 ET. ""We apologise for any inconvenience this caused our customers. A failure of this size is very serious and we are taking the necessary steps to improve our processes with the objective of making sure this doesn't happen again."" Time Warner Cable is in the process of being acquired by Comcast, another US internet service provider. In a separate development, TWC has been ordered to pay a fine following earlier problems with its network. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) said that the company had failed to report the disruptions in a timely manner. As part of a settlement, TWC has agreed to pay a $1.1m (£660,000) penalty and implement a three-year compliance plan.",A fault with Time Warner Cable's network left millions of people cut off from the internet in the US.
"By Zoe KleinmanTechnology reporter Financial paperwork in the study could be read by zooming in on the image. It included a shares dividend cheque, an insurance policy document and an invoice for a stairlift. Some family photos had also been left unblurred. Fowlers estate agent said the private data in the virtual tour had ""slipped past"" its staff and the home owner. The house was available on the property platform Rightmove, and appears to have been live since October 2020. Additional stills photographs of the property showed empty rooms. The firm's owner Philip Fowler told the BBC that his company had withdrawn the 3D tour along with all of its others for further review and said the estate agent ""takes our clients' privacy very seriously"". The owner of the home had given ""verbal permission"" for the video to be used, he added. ""We will be more diligent in the future,"" Mr Fowler said. He also said that people choosing the 3D tour to help sell their properties were advised to put away sensitive material before the photos were taken. Other identifiable data about the home-owners in the property included the names of their pets on a photograph (pet names are commonly used as passwords), clues about their political views based on their choices of reading material, and their health - an asthma inhaler was visible in one of the bedrooms. The BBC has alerted the Information Commissioner's Office. The video was discovered by Carole Theriault, co-host of the Smashing Security podcast, who said she was ""gobsmacked"" by the amount of personal information on display. ""There is way too much information on show for anybody watching the 3D virtual tour to see,"" she said. ""It's a treasure trove of private data - a veritable goldmine for identity thieves, phishers, you name it."" 3D tours have become more popular for house-sellers, especially during the pandemic. Carissa Veliz, author of Privacy is Power, said the estate agent should have taken more care. ""We are much better at collecting personal data than we are at keeping it safe, but if we can't keep it safe, we shouldn't be collecting it in the first place,"" she said.",An estate agent has apologised after a 3D tour of a house for sale in Devon was published with a substantial amount of personal information visible.
"By Zoe KleinmanTechnology reporter, BBC News It means the firm no longer has a connection with making PCs or laptops. Sharp bought 80% of Toshiba's personal computing arm in 2018 for $36m (£27m), and has now bought the remaining shares, Toshiba said in a statement. Toshiba's first laptop, the T1100, launched in 1985. It weighed 4kg (8.8 pounds) and worked with 3.5 inch (8.8cm) floppy disks. It was launched at first only in Europe with an annual sales target of 10,000 units, according to the Toshiba Science Museum website. In 2011 Toshiba sold more than 17m PCs but by 2017 this had fallen to 1.9m, reported Reuters at the time. In 2016, it had ceased making consumer laptops for the European market, focusing only on hardware for businesses. Recent years have been difficult for the conglomerate: in 2015, the firm posted a full-year loss of $318m. That same year its president and vice-president resigned after an independent panel found the company had overstated its profits for the previous six years. In 2019, it wound up its nuclear business NuGen in the UK after failing to find a buyer for it. Consumer demand for laptops has soared in the last few months because of the Coronavirus pandemic and global lockdowns, but overall, the market for personal computers has been tough for quite a while, said analyst Marina Koytcheva from the firm CCS Insight. ""Only those who have managed to sustain scale and price (like Lenovo), or have a premium brand (like Apple) have succeeded in the unforgiving PC market, where volumes have been falling for years,"" she said.",The Japanese giant Toshiba has sold its final stake in the personal computer maker Dynabook.
"By Mark WardTechnology correspondent, BBC News The sophisticated malware is among the first to target the industrial equipment used in power plants and other large scale installations. New research suggests it was designed to disrupt centrifuges often used to enrich uranium. Detailed analysis of the worm has revealed more about the team behind it and what it was supposed to do. Code secrets The close look at the code inside Stuxnet was carried out by Tom Parker from security firm Securicon who specialises in picking out the digital fingerprints hackers leave behind in malware. His analysis of Stuxnet shows it is made of several distinct blocks. One part targets industrial control systems, another handles the worm's methods of spreading itself and another concerns the way its creators planned to communicate with and control it. The most sophisticated part of Stuxnet targeted the Programmable Logic Controllers used in industrial plants to automate the operation of components such as motors or pumps. Subverting PLCs required detailed knowledge of one manufacturer's product line, the programming language written for it and insight into how it could be subverted. That meant, said Mr Parker, the list of suspects was pretty short. ""I do believe the PLC components were written in the West,"" he said. ""It's western companies that are investing most heavily in automation of industrial processes, whether it's putting coke in cans or nuclear enrichment."" ""However, the bits that drop it into a system and the command and control parts are not that advanced at all,"" said Mr Parker. ""I've compared this less advanced code to other malware and it does not score very highly,"" he said. Dedicated hi-tech criminals would not have used such crude methods of distribution and control, he said, suggesting that it was put together by a nation rather than organised crime. What this implies, he said, is that whichever country put Stuxnet together commissioned the creation of the PLC part from a Western nation, then added its own distribution and control code to it. The analysis suggests that a team of 6-10 people were behind Stuxnet and were involved with it for some time. Whoever wrote it would also need information about and access to industrial plants in Iran if that was the actual target, said Mr Parker. Motor control More information has also emerged about how Stuxnet disrupts the industrial control systems it managed to compromise. Research by security firm Symantec has shown that the likely target were frequency controllers that many PLCs are hooked up to in order to regulate a motor. In particular, said Symantec, Stuxnet targeted those operating at frequencies between 807 and 1210Hz. ""There's a limited amount of equipment operating at that speed,"" said Orla Cox, security operations manager at Symantec. ""It knew exactly what it was going after."" ""Those operating at 600hz or above are regulated for export by the US because they can be used to control centrifuges for uranium enrichment,"" she said. If Stuxnet did manage to infect a PLC connected to a centrifuge, it would seriously disrupt its working, said Ms Cox. What is not clear, said Ms Cox, is whether Stuxnet hit its target. If it did not, she said, then the fact that the command and control system has been taken over by security firms has ended any chance of it being used again. ""Our expectation is that the attack is done at this point,"" she said. ""We've not seen any more variants out there and I don't suspect we will."" Mr Parker said that whoever did write it failed in one respect because Stuxnet has not stayed live for as long as its creators hoped. The control system set up needed to have been in place for years to have a seriously disruptive effect on its intended targets, he said. ""Someone has serious egg on their face because they are never going to be able to use this investment ever again,"" he said.",Detailed analysis of the code in the Stuxnet worm has narrowed the list of suspects who could have created it.
"Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent@BBCRoryCJon Twitter SB.TV The first is 21-year-old Jamal Edwards. He grew up on a west London housing estate and left school with few qualifications, but he now has a business called SB.TV, offering all sorts of original video content on YouTube and making some serious money from it. When I popped into his recently acquired offices in Ladbroke Grove, where three of his staff were hard at work, he told me how it got started: ""When I was 14 or 15, I got a video camera for Christmas and I started going out on my estate and filming lots of rappers - and from there it snowballed. I just kept filming every day."" While working by day in a clothes shop, by night he taught himself about making videos and running a business by watching online tutorials. Eventually a cheque arrived from YouTube for the revenue from adverts placed around his videos. ""I thought yeah I can give up working at Topman and make it a business."" The channel has had over 100 million views, and Jamal is very proud that every bit of the content has been filmed by his team. Some artists that have been featured on SB.TV from Jessie J to Ed Sheeran have seen their profiles boosted - for others it's been the only way to get their music to an audience. Jamal says the key for his business is to build a community, and respond to what its members want. Google has already featured Jamal Edwards in an advert, and mainstream TV and music firms are watching SB.TV very closely, desperate to understand the connection it has with its audience. I would not be surprised to see an approach from a potential buyer, but Jamal says he's just concentrating on growing his channel: ""I'm just trying to think of new fresh ideas, keep it buzzing. It's gonna go worldwide man!"" he told me. ""Music, fashion, sport comedy, just gonna build it up."" Unless you're a teenage gamer, you may never have heard of Yogscast, but it is an even bigger video phenomenon than SB.TV. Much bigger, in fact, with one billion views to its YouTube channel so far, and three million people tuning in each day. I first spotted it when browsing through the ""most viewed"" section on YouTube. It seems to be packed with videos about games, all of them accompanied by a slightly eccentric commentary by two young men. ""That's Simon and Lewis from Yogscast, dad,"" my teenage online game-obsessed son explained, in a voice which suggested that anyone who hadn't heard of them must have been asleep for 100 years. So I went to meet Lewis Brindley and Simon Lane in their shiny new offices in Bristol, global headquarters of a business which has only recently moved out of their respective bedrooms. Lewis was working as a freelance journalist four years ago and played online games with a group of people including Simon. ""We would all group together to kill virtual dragons."" He decided that the entertaining chat that happened during the games needed to be put online, so he started making videos featuring him and Simon - who he hadn't even met in real life at that stage. Their double act soon proved popular, especially when they began to focus on Minecraft, a creative game which allows players to build their own worlds and adventures. Then came a key moment: ""I woke up on Christmas Day in 2010 and we were the most viewed video on YouTube,"" Lewis explained. ""That was when it hit me that this was maybe worth quitting our jobs for and having a good go at it."" They have certainly had a good go. Yogscast has assembled a team of more than a dozen people who can all make and edit videos in their new studios in Bristol. Every day, they upload at least one video, with an average length of 15 minutes, and they are working on improving the production values. ""If you don't produce good quality videos, then people won't come back,"" says Lewis. ""We listen very carefully to what our community says."" They are building a network of people making similar videos, and there is an exciting new project, their own video game. Using the crowdfunding site Kickstarter they have raised over $500,000 to create Yogventures, in collaboration with a Los Angeles based game developer. It sounds rather like Minecraft, and if it succeeds on that scale when it launches next year, then Yogscast will be a serious player in the games world as well as in online video. So what are their ambitions? ""I want to be the next Rupert Murdoch,"" Simon told me - though I'm not entirely clear how serious he was. But Lewis, the straight man in the comedy duo, seems pretty focussed on expanding Yogscast and making increasingly professional video content. But has either of these businesses really got a chance to make an impact on TV? When I spoke to the respected media analyst Theresa Wise she freely admitted she'd never heard of either of them - but was impressed by what I told her about their ambitions. She warned, however, that this was a hits-driven business: ""There are two issues - keeping generating the hits and convincing people you're still cool. When dads start to like you there's a danger that people switch to other things."" It is, in her words, a ""fickle old business"". But wouldn't it be great to see Jamal Edwards and the Yogscast duo Simon and Lewis prove that in the internet age Britain can create TV tycoons with staying power?","What do you need to run a TV channel? Not much these days - get a cheap video camera and access to the internet, and you can soon be a TV tycoon, albeit on a very small scale. But I've been meeting two channels run by young British entrepreneurs who are showing the TV establishment the way to connect audiences and grow businesses in a hurry."
"The company said that since Tuesday, data use on its network had increased by between 35-60%. On Thursday, Netflix said it would lower the picture quality of movies in Europe, to reduce data use. But BT said daytime and evening usage was still much lower than the highest levels it had ever recorded. In a statement, BT said: ""The additional load... is well within manageable limits and we have plenty of headroom for it to grow still further"". The highest rate of traffic BT has ever seen on its own network is 17.5 terabits per second (Tbps), on an evening where there was high demand for video games downloads and streaming football. At a data rate of 1Tbps, 125 gigabytes (GB) is downloaded every second - the equivalent of about 55 high-definition movies. By comparison, average daytime use on BT's network this week has been 7.5Tbps - far below the highest peak that the company said it had been able to handle. While analysing its data, BT said it discovered that: However, it warned that mobile phone voice calls could be affected if demand increased. It said current use was ""well within the levels the network is built to handle"", but encouraged customers to use a landline phone if they have one, or internet voice-calling services such as Skype, WhatsApp or Zoom instead. Virgin Media said it was seeing a similar 50% boost to the amount of downloaded data during the day - but added that this was still below its evening peaks. Uploads, meanwhile, were 80% higher than normal during daytime hours. Virgin said the number of voice calls via its landlines were also up by 80% during the busiest time of the day. Movie streaming On Thursday, Netflix said it would reduce the bitrate of movies in Europe, to reduce data use by about 25%. The company said it was in response to ""the extraordinary challenges raised by the coronavirus"". Other video-providers are considering similar moves. Amazon's Prime Video said it was talking to local authorities, and had ""already begun the effort to reduce streaming bitrates whilst maintaining a quality streaming experience"" in Europe - including the UK. A spokesman for BBC's iPlayer service said: ""We're in contact with the relevant organisations to determine what action to take."" Several factors influence how much data is used when streaming a movie online. One of them is video resolution, including whether a video is high-definition (HD) or ultra-high definition 4K. Another is bitrate, which influences how clear and smooth videos look when streamed online Videos with a higher bitrate tend to look less ""blocky"" or pixelated, but use more data. Out of these two, Netflix says it will cut its streaming bitrates. Customers who pay for higher-definition services will still get higher-resolution video. BT said that Netflix's decision was based on the needs of all European operators - but that the UK's network was resilient. ""The UK has a very capable core network because UK consumers are more heavily invested in HD-streaming video, including live football, Netflix, than many other nations,"" a spokesman said. ""So in the UK there isn't a pressing need to reduce bitrates at the current time, but we are supportive of the move, as clearly the situation is unprecedented and it is common sense to do it."" With all the extra people working from home, daytime use has only jumped by half, it said, from 5tbps to 7.5tbps. ""I've seen a flurry of media stories reflecting an understandable concern that our networks will be unable to cope with the additional traffic of millions of home-workers,"" Howard Watson, BT's technology officer, said. ""However the UK's communications infrastructure is well within its capacity limits, and has significant headroom for growth in demand.""","BT says its broadband infrastructure has plenty of ""headroom"" to cope with increased demand as more people stay home due to coronavirus."
"There had been much speculation about whether the Xbox Series X or PlayStation 5 would be first to be priced. Last time around, Sony substantially undercut its rival after waiting to go second. However, one expert said the Japanese firm would be hard pushed to do so again given its finances. Microsoft tweeted that the new machine would cost £449 in the UK, €500 in Europe and $499 in the States. And in a surprise move, it added that EA's Play games subscription service would be bundled with its own Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, to offer members a wider range of titles to choose from. The announcement came the day after the US tech giant revealed that a second less powerful version of the next-generation console, called the Xbox Series S, would cost £250. ""This is aggressive pricing for the technology that's included in the Series X,"" Piers Harding-Rolls from Ampere Analysis told the BBC. ""And Microsoft must feel confident about the offer in deciding to go first."" He added that in theory this gave its competitor a chance to steal an advantage by again going for a lower price tag. In 2013, Sony revealed the basic PS4 would be £80 cheaper than the equivalent Xbox One, hours after Microsoft had disclosed its launch plans, helping Sony claim to offer better value But the analyst said it was unlikely to repeat the trick as its recent performance gave it less room to manoeuvre. Microsoft's last full year profit was 13% higher than the previous period at $44.3bn. Its Xbox division only accounted for 9% of its sales. By contrast, Sony's net profit contracted by 36% to $5.4bn. And it is more dependent on its PlayStation unit, which generated 24% of its sales. The PlayStation 4 has outsold the Xbox One by a healthy margin. But Mr Harding-Rolls suggested Microsoft had ""deeper pockets"" to invest this time round, and should also benefit from its Games Pass subscription including new first-party blockbuster releases. Sony's equivalent PlayStation Now is limited to older titles. Microsoft has said that pre-orders for both its new consoles would begin on 22 September ahead of their 10 November release. That puts pressure on Sony to reveal its own pricing and do likewise to help secure sales at a time when the coronavirus is causing uncertainty for consumers' own personal finances.","Microsoft has revealed what its next flagship games console will cost, opting to do so before its rival Sony."
"Classed as ""external communications"", such activity can be covered by a broad warrant and intercepted without extra clearance, spy boss Charles Farr said. The policy was revealed as part of a legal battle with campaign group Privacy International (PI). PI labelled the policy ""patronising"". It is the first time the UK has commented on how its legal framework allows the mass interception of communications, as outlined by US whistleblower Edward Snowden in his leaks about global government surveillance. The former National Security Agency contractor revealed extensive details of internet and phone snooping and has since fled the US and sought temporary asylum in Russia. Charles Farr, director general of the Office for Security and Counter-Terrorism, told PI that Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and web searches on Google - as well as webmail services such as Hotmail and Yahoo - were classified as ""external communications"", which meant they could be intercepted without the need for additional legal clearance. Internal communications between citizens can only be intercepted when a targeted warrant is issued. Warrants must be signed by a minister and can only be issued when there is suspicion of illegal activity. But when someone searches for something on Google or posts on Facebook they are sending information overseas - constituting an act of external communication that could be collected under a broader warrant which does not need to be signed by a minister, explained Mr Farr in a 48-page written statement. However, he said data collected in this way ""cannot be read, looked at or listened to"" except in strictly limited circumstances. Mr Farr said there was a ""significant distinction"" between intercepting material and a person actually reading, looking at or listening it. Although this is the first time Mr Farr has publicly commented on the matter, the issue was previously raised by privacy researcher Caspar Bowden. He briefed the House of Lords in 2000 ahead of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act coming into effect, which granted GCHQ the relevant power. However, he told the BBC that his testimony was only presented to a near-empty House of Lords and was not reported outside of Hansard. Analysis - Gordon Corera, security correspondent British intelligence has always said that its activities are lawful. But one of the problems has been that the law surrounding interception is incredibly hard to understand. Charles Farr's statement provides new details of how the government believes it applies to different forms of communications. It reveals that a Google search by someone in Britain may be considered an external communication because the request and the result go abroad to Google's computers. That means it could be swept up under the broader warrant covering ""external ""communications. However, Mr Farr says that actually reading or examining a Briton's communications swept up in this way would still require a domestic, more targeted warrant. Much of the debate over whether the state does conduct mass surveillance comes down to a central question - does the act of computers collecting information constitute surveillance or does it take a person reading or accessing that data for someone's privacy to be invaded? Speak to privacy advocates and government officials and you get a radically different answer. Mr Farr did not reveal the extent to which GCHQ used its power to intercept external communications. In a statement, GCHQ said all its work was ""carried out in accordance with a strict legal and policy framework which ensures that our activities are authorised, necessary and proportionate"". 'Byzantine' laws But civil liberty groups were outraged by the revelations. James Welch, legal director of human rights group Liberty, said: ""The security services consider that they're entitled to read, listen and analyse all our communications on Facebook, Google and other US-based platforms. ""If there was any remaining doubt that our snooping laws need a radical overhaul there can be no longer."" Meanwhile, Eric King, deputy director of Privacy International, said the revelation showed that spy agencies operated under their own laws. ""Intelligence agencies cannot be considered accountable to Parliament and to the public they serve when their actions are obfuscated through secret interpretations of Byzantine laws."" But some others did not find the revelations surprising. Alan Woodward, a security expert who has undertaken consultancy work for GCHQ, said: ""I think what is happening is that people are just becoming familiar with legislation that has been in place for many years, probably because of all the civil liberty groups raising concerns. As you can see from the Act, it has never been a secret. ""The bit that people tend to forget is that RIPA [Regulation of Investigatory Powers] has protections as well, something you won't find in many other countries. The difference in the UK is that civil liberty organisations have the right to challenge these things, a right which they would not have in, say, Russia."" However, Mr Bowden suggested the relevant statute had been obscurely worded. ""Interpreting that section requires the unravelling of a triple-nested inversion of meanings across six cross-referenced subsections, linked to a dozen other cross-linked definitions, which are all dependent on a highly ambiguous 'notwithstanding',"" he said. The legal challenge, brought by PI, Amnesty, the American Civil Liberties Union and six other national civil liberties organisations, was a direct response to the revelations made by Mr Snowden about the UK's global digital surveillance.","UK intelligence service GCHQ can legally snoop on British use of Google, Facebook and web-based email without specific warrants because the firms are based abroad, the government has said."
"The virtual currency peaked at $5,103.91 in the early hours of Saturday, according to CoinDesk's price index. The record high helped push the total value of publicly traded crypto-currencies - including Ethereum and the Bitcoin-offshoot Bitcoin Cash - to more than $176bn. However, there has since been a sell-off. At time of writing, Bitcoin was 12% off its peak, at $4,485. Sell orders At the start of the year, one bitcoin traded for less than $1,000, and as recently as July some market watchers feared that the currency could crash lower as a result of a mooted ""civil war"" over its future. However, since then, its value has been boosted, after most of its developers and miners - those who authorise transactions by contributing computing power - began implementing a compromise plan to let the technology handle more transactions per minute. In addition, August's ""fork"" of the underlying blockchain - the ledger of past Bitcoin transfers - created the new virtual currency Bitcoin Cash without causing major disruption to the original asset. Both events attracted media attention, which has been linked to Bitcoin's subsequent climb. Despite the current fallback, one expert said he expected Bitcoin to continue to rise over the medium term. ""We've seen drops like this happen before when a particular number is hit - often because people have placed orders with exchanges to exit a currency when it reaches a certain value,"" said Eitan Jankelewitz, a specialist in crypto-currencies at the London-based law firm Sheridans. ""And it's human nature to pick a round number [like $5,000]. ""But traditional investors are starting to view having crypto-currency as a small part of their diversified portfolios as an acceptable way to add risk. ""Plus, there are more companies that are making it easy to buy Bitcoin at scale without having to understand how the technology works or how to keep it safe.""","Bitcoin has crossed the $5,000 (£3,862) threshold for the first time."
"By Tim WeberBusiness editor, BBC News website The consumer electronics giant is now officially the world's largest maker of phones. By some reckoning it is also the biggest maker of smartphones (although that is debateable). For the company's bottom line that hardly matters. After all, most of Apple's products could quite as well carry the label ""Samsung inside"", with the South Korean firm providing most of the key hardware components in Apple's mobile devices. Many of Samsung's and Apples rivals have faltered in recent years - not just Nokia, but also Sony and HTC. They failed to innovate fast enough and lost the buzz that no mobile phone maker can do without. Samsung is different. Its designers and engineers have not relaxed while the firm was riding on a high. With the new Galaxy S3 they have clearly managed to move to the front of the smartphone field, ahead of mighty Apple itself. The S3 with its 4.8 inch screen is a big phone, but very slim as well. Tiny hands won't be able to grasp it comfortably. But it feels surprisingly light, weighing in at a mere 133 grams. The Samsung marketing team speaks of an ""organic design,"" which is pushing it a bit, but the phone is very comfortable to the touch. Most impressive is probably the 8 megapixel camera, which boasts ""zero shutter lag"" and a burst speed of 3.3 pictures per second, for up to 20 pictures. Staying awake Samsung's new quad core processor - much faster and more energy efficient - plays high-definition video without lag or shuddering, even when I played the video in a minimised window in the foreground and used other applications in the background. Never mind Apple's ""retina display"", the S3's Super HD Amoled screen is stunning. It's too early to judge battery life, but on paper the S3 should not suffer the fate of the many smartphones that die during the second half of the day. There are also nice software touches. The screen does not go to sleep as long as one looks at it. The phone is ""social""; it recognises the faces of your friends in a picture you've just taken, and offers to send it to them at the touch of a button. Samsung's phone-to-phone sharing of videos and pictures is less likely to take off, as it requires that your friends' phones sport the same software. Overall, the Galaxy S3 is an impressive phone, likely to capture an even larger marketshare than its S2 predecessor managed to carve out. However, Samsung's lead may not last for long. In the mind of many consumers, Apple is still THE trendsetter of the smartphone world, and if the rumours are true and the launch of the iPhone 5 is imminent, then Samsung can enjoy just a few months' worth of technological advantage. Still, Samsung has learned from Apple, with the Galaxy S3 on sale just a few weeks after the big unveiling. And if Apple fails to refresh its iPhone line-up soon, Samsung should be able to have its smartphone cake and eat it.","If there is one company challenging Apple in the smartphone world, it is Samsung."
"Currently the search giant has limited its roll-out to Kansas City, where residents can get up to one gigabit per second speeds for $70 (£44) per month. In December Google chairman Eric Schmidt said the firm was looking for new cities to expand into. On its website announcing that fibre was coming to Austin, it invited people to sign up for the service. The announcement was made by Google, along with Mayor of Austin Lee Leffingwell. Google said it planned to start connecting homes by mid-2014. Dark fibre On its blog Google said that it had chosen Austin because the city was ""a mecca for creativity and entrepreneurialism, with thriving artistic and tech communities"". Currently Google is offering its fibre service in Kansas City, which straddles the border between the states of Kansas and Missouri, and its environs. ""We're sure these folks will do amazing things with gigabit access and we feel very privileged to have been welcomed to their community, said Milo Medin, vice-president of Google Fiber. The gigabit service is likely to be offered with the same tariffs as in Kansas, with no installation charge. This package also comes with 1TB (terabyte) of storage on Google Drive. Alternatively subscribers can opt for a broadband plus TV service at a price of $120 (£75). The third option is to pay a one-off $300 (£189) installation fee in return for free broadband at speeds of 5Mbps. Steven Hartley, an analyst with research firm Ovum, thinks the move will give US incumbent broadband operators cause to sit up and take notice. ""Google has a long way to go before it becomes a nationwide ISP but clearly it feels that the Kansas experiment was a success and it is in a position to cherry-pick its locations,"" he said. Google's Fiber project was first announced in 2010. Interest in the idea was huge with more than 1,000 towns and cities applying to be part of it. Kansas City was the eventual winner and services began rolling out in November 2012. Google is able to make the foray into broadband installation because it has been buying up so-called dark fibre from telecoms firms in the US in order to link up its data centres which are dotted around the country. It has also been investing in cheap fibre that has been laid by companies that have subsequently gone bankrupt before completing roll-outs.","Google has confirmed that it will be extending its super-fast fibre broadband service to Austin, Texas."
"By Cristina CriddleTechnology reporter More than 160,000 people were trying to access Currys PC World website at one point on Wednesday, which had only a limited supply. The recommended retail price starts at £449 - but eBay bids are currently running to thousands of pounds. Experts said a rise in bots buying consoles added to the high demand had led to technical difficulties. Sold out PlayStation said the demand was unprecedented. On Wednesday morning, a message on the Currys PC World site said it ""now has limited PS5 stock"". But it sold out in under an hour. And thousands were left in a virtual queue on the website throughout the day - with a warning message displayed to customers about heavy traffic, hours after the items sold. High demand ""This morning, a limited number of PlayStation 5 [consoles] were made available online for purchase at the original RRP of £449,"" said Currys PC World gaming head Nick Hayden said. ""The website received a surge in traffic. ""And we sold out of stock within the hour. ""Due to very high demand for this product, we operated an online queuing system. ""We apologise if this caused any frustrations for our customers."" Both Game and John Lewis also recently received new stock of the console and rapidly sold out. Ampere Analysis senior gaming analyst Louise Shorthouse said: “Many [retailers] likely knew they would have problems beforehand. “But ensuring your website is capable of withstanding a huge influx of visitors is expensive. ""And for an infrequent event like this, it is simply not worth the cost.” Netacea e-commerce head Thomas Platt said: “This is certainly the highest online demand for a console we’ve ever seen. “Much of the demand is driven by the fact consumers can’t wait in line and enter physical stores to pick up their consoles.” 'Getting easier' Automated retail bots scan websites around the world for the exact second an item goes on sale And one dedicated toy bot, Carnage Bot, tweeted it had secured 2,000 PS5 consoles from Game's supply of fresh stock. “Over 2,000 checkouts successfully logged for today’s Game restock on the PS5,"" it said, ""just keeps getting easier each time.” But Game told Gaming Bible it would be checking orders to remove multiple sales to the same buyer. ""At the present time, these orders are still pre-orders,"" it said. ""And as such, no payments have yet been taken from customers. ""Payments will commence once our order checks have been completed."" Carnage Bot has since set its account to private. And its website is no longer working. “The bots that targeted the original launch of the PS5 back in November will have advanced and developed new ways to conceal their identity, some posing as real customers, giving bot actors the opportunity to still escape with the goods,” Mr Platt said. Ms Shorthouse said: “Scalpers using bots is certainly a huge problem and one we have seen before in other areas, such as concert-ticket sales [although events are easier to regulate]. “If more genuine consumers are able to purchase the console, there is a knock-on effect. “Less sales then take place via resale sites like eBay. ""And a decrease in demand makes the whole operation less appealing and less lucrative for the scalpers. “This is all exacerbated by the shift to online. ""It is very difficult to contend with bots. ""And more people than ever are now choosing to buy online. ""Scalpers would not be able to pull this off in a physical store.”",New stock of the PlayStation 5 console has led to thousands of gamers waiting in virtual queues online.
"Twitter's Amplify product will insert advertising into relevant videos based on categories chosen by the advertiser. It bears similarities to the model used by YouTube, which offers payment to YouTubers for featuring short ads before their own content. Twitter has not yet revealed what cut of advertising revenue it will take. Pre-roll ads are currently only available to US advertisers and video publishers, though Twitter has said it plans to roll out the feature globally over time. The BBC understands that the company will take a 30% cut of revenue, with the rest going to publishers who agree to have ads played before their content. Many of the ads are likely to be repurposed from television, according to IHS analyst Eleni Marouli. ""It's a way to compete with TV ad budgets, which are the biggest in the industry,"" she said. ""Every online platform is trying to grab a piece of those ad budgets."" However, Ms Marouli also commented that Twitter might have a hard time getting users to feel comfortable with pre-roll ads on the platform compared with YouTube. ""With Twitter it's a little bit more challenging because they have this more immediate, 140 character scroll-through product,"" she said.","Twitter users will have to watch pre-roll advertising on videos in tweets, thanks to a new service on the platform."
"Amazon has accused its rival of attempting to ""bully"" the IT companies into picking a rival platform. The row follows a report by the Wall Street Journal, which said other unnamed large retailers had also asked vendors to shun Amazon Web Services. The row comes at a time Amazon is expanding its shopping operations. Last Friday, the Seattle-based business announced a $13.7bn (£10.8bn) takeover of the groceries chain Whole Foods. And this week it revealed it had struck a deal with Nike to sell the sportswear-maker's shoes directly, and that it was launching Prime Wardrobe - a service that lets customers order and try clothes for seven days before deciding which to buy and keep. Amazon's Web Services division may not be as well known to the public as the company's retail operations, but it is a huge money-earner. In April, the company reported the unit had generated $3.7bn in sales over the previous three months. The business provides computing power, online storage, security protection and developer tools to third parties. Its clients include Netflix, Airbnb, General Electric and the CIA. According to market research company Gartner, AWS leads the market in its field. However, Walmart uses Microsoft's rival Azure service. A spokesman for Walmart acknowledged it had concerns about its suppliers' use of AWS. ""Our vendors have the choice of using any cloud provider that meets their needs and their customers' needs,"" he said. ""It shouldn't be a big surprise that there are cases in which we'd prefer our most sensitive data isn't sitting on a competitor's platform."" Amazon suggested this approach was misguided. ""We've heard that Walmart continues to try to bully their suppliers into not using AWS because they have an incorrect view that AWS is somehow supporting Amazon's retail business,"" said a spokesman. ""Plenty of suppliers are standing up to Walmart and refusing to be told that they can't use [us]. ""Tactics like this are bad for business and customers and rarely carry the day."" AWS's use of encryption means that its own staff cannot peer into the data stored on its computer servers by its customers. But one analyst said it was still understandable Walmart and others might not want to help send business its way. ""AWS is a separate part of Amazon's business, but ultimately this comes back to being frightened of being disrupted, especially in light of the recent acquisition of Whole Foods,"" said Nick McQuire, from the consultancy CCS Insight. ""The question is whether this fear now will cause a wider backlash among retailers, where you get many within the community switching from using AWS in the cloud to Google, Microsoft or someone else.""","Walmart, the US's biggest retail chain, has been accused of trying to coerce its technology suppliers into shunning Amazon's cloud computing service."
"The Microsoft Band will retail for $199 (£125) on the company's online store. The device can operate for two days on a single charge and has 10 sensors that can track heart rate, calories, stress and even a person's sun exposure. It marks Microsoft's latest push into digital health after its medical record initiative HealthVault in 2007. ""This is just the beginning of a multi-year vision for Microsoft in the health & fitness and wearables category,"" the company said in an emailed statement. ""We want to enter this space in a deliberate and measured fashion and as such are launching first in the United States."" Technology giants Apple, Samsung and Google have all released health initiatives and are looking to further develop the growing demand for wearable devices. However, Microsoft's device is distinctive because it will work with all major mobile operating systems as well as connect to social networks such as Facebook and Twitter. ""Consumers now have an overwhelming choice of health-related cloud platforms to choose from,"" Ben Wood from CCS Insight told the BBC. ""They can be forgiven for being confused by the multitude of options. It's going to be a tough decision to choose whether to place their loyalty with Apple, Google or Microsoft given the immaturity of all three platforms. Furthermore, once they choose a platform they risk locking themselves into a long term commitment if they want to keep a lifetime of health-related data in one place."" Analysis: Richard Taylor, BBC North American technology correspondent Microsoft had long been rumoured to be working on a health-centric wearable - and its timing, ahead of the busy holiday season, is no surprise either. More than anything, Microsoft cannot be seen to be left behind, especially when other tech giants like Google and Apple are entering the burgeoning health-tech arena. The Band will compete in an increasingly crowded marketplace. Smaller startups like FitBit and Jawbone initially kick-started the sector, and today other consumer electronics hardware giants (notably Samsung) already have some traction and offer an array of devices. However, Microsoft appears to be offering something a little different. Unlike many of the more recent smartwatches which have recently come to market, the Band's dazzling array of sensors suggests a primary focus on fitness-tracking rather than attempting to be a multi-purpose smartphone accessory. And whereas others work largely with one mobile operating system, the Band and its companion Health app are cross-platform. Microsoft's cloud-based health service is also a key differentiator; harnessing Redmond's strength in cloud computing, it will offer users deep insights of data gathered from other fitness devices and rival smartphones too. Critics will say this openness was somewhat inevitable, as its own Windows Phone has negligible market share. But it could well prove a canny move, broadening its appeal not just to consumers but also to other hardware partners, who will be able to licence Microsoft's core sensor technology to make new gadgets of their own. Leaked details Details about the Microsoft Band were leaked on Wednesday after companion applications for Windows, Android and Mac phones appeared on its website ahead of an official announcement. A Microsoft Band Sync app appeared in the Mac App Store and revealed what the product looks like. Some analysts believe Microsoft will face stiff competition in the wearables market because ""the company has little or no brand"". ""Microsoft is targeting the higher tiers of the fitness band market - it's going to have to make a big marketing investment to raise awareness with US consumers,"" Mr Wood said. ""The number of fitness bands that have been launched this year is overwhelming - personally I'm already testing two on each wrist and I'm rapidly running out of places to wear them. It must be a daunting prospect for consumers trying to decide which one to buy.""",Microsoft has unveiled its first wearable device that can track a user's sleep and exercise as well as connect to a health service on smartphones.
"Net neutrality is the principle that ISPs should not block web traffic for customers who pay less to give faster speeds to those who pay more. The US Federal Communication Commission (FCC) adopted the rules in 2010. They were challenged by ISP Verizon, which claimed the FCC was overstepping its legal authority. The court agreed. Supporters of net neutrality said the ruling was a major threat to how people use the internet. 'Free speech' The rules were designed to ensure that small or start-up organisations had as much chance of reaching an online audience as a large, established company. But broadband providers argue that some traffic-heavy sites - for example, YouTube or Netflix - put a strain on their infrastructure. They say they should be able to charge such content providers so that users who pay more can get faster access to those sites than other customers. As a consequence, companies who did not pay would find that access to their services could be slower for customers. Verizon had said in September 2013 that if it were not for net neutrality rules they would be looking at different pricing models. In a statement released after the ruling Verizon said that the court's decision would not affect customers' ability to access and use the internet as they do now. ""The court's decision will allow more room for innovation, and consumers will have more choices to determine for themselves how they access and experience the internet,"" it said. The boss of BitTorrent - a system for sharing large files using peer-to-peer technology - warned that the court's decision would be a major threat to innovation, free speech and ""the internet as we know it."" ""For the ISPs, it's a momentous decision. This ruling will consolidate their powerful role as arbiters of culture and speech. ""And we can expect this consolidation to escalate now that big content and big networks have been given an unambiguous green light. ""For everyone else, permission to play - the ability to even compete - will come at a cost,"" said chief executive Eric Klinker The FCC said it would consider appealing. Chairman Tom Wheeler said: ""We will consider all available options, including those for appeal, to ensure that these networks on which the internet depends continue to provide a free and open platform for innovation and expressions.""",A US federal appeals court has rejected rules intended to prevent internet service providers (ISPs) from prioritising certain types of content.
"Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent@BBCRoryCJon Twitter How worried should we be - and even if we are convinced this is harmful is there anything that can be done about it? And isn't it the job of parents, not regulators, to keep children safe online? ATVOD has an interesting analysis of how the business model for pornography has changed, and how that has made it much more likely that children will stumble across it - or find it easier to seek out. The regulator says that it used to be quite hard to find this material, especially without handing over credit card details. But then they took inspiration from the likes of YouTube and began to offer hours of video for nothing, making money from adverts, and getting users to ""trade up"" to premium services. The result is that hardcore material is just one click away - the ""tube"" sites don't even post a warning site, so any child arriving on their homepages will immediately see explicit material. Many parents will be deeply shocked by the numbers in the ATVOD report, and will doubtless cheer the regulator on as it asks the government for new powers to pursue sites that don't even try to keep children out. The problem is that just about every one of these sites is based abroad, mainly in North America. ATVOD's idea is to follow the money - get credit and debit card companies to withdraw their facilities from the websites unless they show they are doing effective age checks. The payment firms say they will act if it is shown that the sites are breaking the law, but the regulator accepts that means new legislation. One of the biggest operators of these pornography sites - including the one named by ATVOD as having attracted 112,000 underage visitors in December - is a business called MindGeek. It describes itself on its very respectable corporate website as ""a global industry-leading information technology firm"" with headquarters in Luxembourg - but on a blog it also trumpets the fact that is ""the world's biggest porn site"". We contacted Mindgeek to seek a response to ATVOD's research, and its call for payment firms to stop dealing with porn firms which don't impose age restrictions. A spokeswoman in the firm's Montreal office provided a statement. She said the company did require adults to go through an age verification process in countries where that was required. But the statement went on: ""The entire issue of verifying age online is an on-going struggle with no easy solution. Unfortunately, the truth of the matter is that there is no simple answer when it comes to protecting children in a digital age."" As for blocking payments services, MindGeek claimed that would hurt its advertisers rather than its own operation - though that may hardly be a concern for the regulator. The porn company maintains that the best approach is to help parents by promoting the use of internet filters. That's a view which may be more widely shared - the government has responded to ATVOD's report by trumpeting its action last year to make British ISPs provide family-friendly filters with the default setting switched to on. The regulator says that filters aren't foolproof, and it's lobbying hard to get ministers to take a tougher stance. Libertarians will see this as a censorship move which in any case won't work. ATVOD accepts that there's no way of keeping all children away from online pornography, but argues that even a small reduction in the numbers will be worthwhile. In all kinds of areas, from pornography to online gambling to illegal file-sharing, regulators are trying to exercise national control over the global web. They've had a few victories - the UK is acting to stop gambling sites reaching underage gamblers. But mostly the web remains ungovernable.","Today's research from Nielsen for the online video regulator ATVOD confirms something not particularly surprising - that pornography on the web is very popular and is a huge business. But by showing that large numbers of children are getting unrestricted access to hardcore pornography, ATVOD is raising some difficult questions."
"Traditionally a place for studios to show off what they have been working on, this year the gaming industry extravaganza has shaped up a little differently. Publisher EA has decided to run a separate event aimed at gamers, while rival Activision is letting the console companies promote its games, rather than having its own showcase. ""Usually it has been a retail show connecting publishers with buyers, but that is less relevant now due to the digital opportunities in gaming,"" said Piers Harding-Rolls, director of games at consultancy IHS Technology. ""But E3 still has an important role to play. It's where people learn about new products coming to market."" And plenty of studios have capitalised on the excitement around E3 to tease their new releases, many squeezing out announcements before doors open on 14 June. Of course, if previous years are anything to go by, there are likely to be a few surprises during the week. Game developer's ones to watch Harvey Smith has worked on critically acclaimed games including cyberpunk role-playing adventure Deus Ex, and stealth-action thriller Dishonored, which won the Bafta award for best game in 2013. The BBC asked him to share the games he's most looking forward to at E3. Overland I'm a big fan of Adam Saltsman. His game Capsule - an incredibly tense and claustrophobic space travel game - is sublime. Overland is a thoughtful, soulful, post-apocalyptic road trip game with a beautifully laconic art style. Every year, there's an indie game or two that just feels like it was made for me. This year, it might be Overland. Luna I really like Robin Hunicke's work and the art style is super cute - but it goes beyond that. I love that you're not really sure what kind of game it will be. It's the combination of looking sweet and naive on the surface, but somehow hinting at something more complex and sophisticated. I suspect it's a bit of a Trojan horse in that respect. No Man's Sky We play games for a variety of reasons. Some people play games to demonstrate mastery over systems; some play to marvel at a reality beyond ours; some play to feel a sense of wonder at the ecological grandeur of the world. No Man's Sky promises all of that, seducing us with unknown possibilities. Deus Ex: Mankind Divided As one of the people to have participated in the genesis of the Deus Ex brand of dystopia, I am full of hope for the new Deus Ex game. If it's all I want it to be, it will present players with a gritty world gone wrong, challenging moral terrain, and flexible game systems that lead to improvisational ""play"" in the true sense of the word. State of Decay 2 (Rumoured) As a fan of often nihilistic zombie fiction, I was really drawn to State of Decay. The original was a gem in the rough. The best thing about the game was the way it kept enabling player-driven stories. So many times, I got into a tight spot of my own making, then managed to get out of it through creative play. Some moments left me sweating and yelling when I got back to home base, and those moments were generally unscripted. If the new game is more polished, this could be really strong. Red Dead Redemption 2 (Rumoured) I grew up watching spaghetti westerns. They're problematic, but they occupy a mythic place in my soul. I loved Red Dead Redemption for its pacing and exploration value - watching a good western is cool, but inhabiting one is another thing entirely. I still miss my beautiful horse, killed by a pair of mountain lions, both of which I shot dead and skinned. I hope the developers took note of the stories players told after engaging with the game. Hardware reboot Three short years have passed since the PlayStation 4 (PS4) and Xbox One went on sale, but there is an expectation that both consoles will soon be refreshed. In the past, Microsoft and Sony refined their consoles during their lifecycles with cosmetic changes and occasionally some useful upgrades such as a larger hard drive. But this time round more significant changes are planned. Sony revealed to the Financial Times on Friday that it is working on an upgraded PS4 codenamed Neo. It said it would be able to handle 4K output - four times the detail of 1080p high definition - but would not be ready to unveil at E3. Sony added it would be more expensive than the basic version, which will continue to be made, but did not say by how much. ""I do not believe the new PS4 will be possible of native 4K gaming,"" commented Mr Harding-Rolls. ""The cost implications on both the device and content creation make this unfeasible. ""It is likely to support 4K video - as this is where the majority of 4K content is emerging - and will probably upscale PS4 games to 4K output. ""Whether this upscaling significantly improves the visuals probably depends on the game, the size of the 4K TV it is shown on and the quality of upscaling."" Gaming blogs have also suggested that a smaller Xbox One could be unveiled at E3. The console has been criticised for being bulkier than its predecessor, although Microsoft designer Carl Ledbetter has explained the size helps keep the machine cool and allows it to run quietly. Nintendo has already confirmed it is working on a new console - codenamed NX - but has said it will not be showing the device at E3. Virtual becomes reality Virtual reality was expected to steal the show at last year's E3, but despite high-profile backing from the likes of Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, gamers with VR headsets are still few and far between. Headsets such as the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive are finally making their way onto gamers' faces, so 2016 could be the year that blockbuster titles that attract the masses are announced. Sony's PlayStation VR is due out in October - perhaps perfectly timed for the highly anticipated space exploration game No Man's Sky to be revealed as a launch title. Creator Sean Murray has said it would be a ""perfect fit"" for VR, and it has been tested in Oculus - but he has yet to reveal more. Microsoft currently has no VR hardware of its own, instead focusing on its Hololens augmented reality helmet, which superimposes graphics over real-world views. But the Xbox controller already works with the Oculus Rift headset, and there is speculation that Microsoft will announce a tie-up with the Oculus platform. ""Microsoft has been looking at an open approach to VR, inviting manufacturers to use its Windows platform to build their businesses on,"" said Mr Harding-Rolls. ""I think it would be a stretch to go from those ideas, to announcing an exclusive agreement to bring a particular VR headset manufacturer to Xbox One. ""But it has to put forward strategies to convince Xbox 360 users who haven't converted yet to upgrade."" And for the players? The PS4 has pulled ahead of Xbox One in the console race, so gamers will be watching Microsoft closely for exclusives. Gaming blogs have suggested two series featuring the undead will be revived. ""We're expecting Dead Rising 4, and State of Decay 2 - both have performed well on the Xbox platform before,"" said Tom Phillips, deputy news editor at Eurogamer. Some of last year's biggest announcements - such as first-person shooter Gears of War 4, and role-playing game Scalebound - have yet to be released. Sony too has yet to deliver on some of its previous announcements, such as The Last Guardian, a fantasy-adventure about a boy who befriends a cat-bird hybrid creature. It was first announced at E3 in 2009. ""The Last Guardian has achieved an almost mythical quality by this point,"" said Mr Phillips. ""It's finally coming out this year, so hopefully it's the last time we'll see it trailed at E3. But it does feel like when these big games do come out, they are generally well received, as with Uncharted. ""This year, I think we'll see Sony hand over the stage to some of the games it has tie-ins with, such as Call of Duty."" The military-inspired shooter began as a Windows game in 2003, but now offers some add-on content to PlayStation gamers first. It's shaping up to be a relatively quiet E3 for Nintendo, but it is likely to attract attention with its much-delayed Legend of Zelda game, with a new quest for the young sword-wielding hero Link. It is one of the bestselling series of all time, but the latest instalment has been repeatedly delayed. First announced in 2014, is now tipped to be a launch title for the NX console, and could end up being the last big home-grown game Nintendo releases for the Wii U. Not everything promised at E3 is successfully delivered. Ubisoft was criticised after its 2012 demo of Watch Dogs featured superior graphics to those that appeared in the released console games. A San Francisco-set sequel has been teased ahead of E3. ""First time round there was huge interest in the game, but it didn't quite live up to expectations,"" said Mr Phillips. ""Ubisoft has a history of having a good idea but not quite getting it right until the second release, as with Assassin's Creed. ""Hopefully with this sequel they have had time to refine it.""

"It said theresolution of the display was 2,048 by 1,536 pixels. The tablet is also powered by a new A5X chip with improved graphics performance. Chief executive Tim Cook claimed to have ""redefined once again the category Apple created"". Apple dominates the market but should face a fresh challenge later this year when tablets running the full Windows 8 system are expected to go on sale. The new iPad - which is simply called by that name - also features a 5-megapixel camera sensor. It will be able to run on 4G LTE networks where the service is available and can act as a wi-fi hotspot for other devices if carriers allow the function. It is 9.4mm deep, slightly thicker than the 8.8mm profile of the iPad 2. The basic 16GB model with only wi-fi will cost £399 and the top of the range 64GB model with wi-fi and 4G will cost £659. Apple's marketing chief Phil Schiller said the tablet has the same 10-hour estimated battery life as the previous model using only wi-fi. That limit shortens by an hour when using 4G. It is due to go on sale on 16 March in the UK, US, Canada, Germany, France, Switzerland, Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia and Japan. The previous model will stay on sale at a reduced price, starting at £329. Mr Schiller said that would make it more affordable for schools to buy the machine. The firm also announced an upgraded TV box which can now handle 1080p video. Films and TV shows will be sold via its iTunes store in the high-definition format. Mixed reactions IMS Research said Apple accounted for 62% of the global tablet market in 2011. Ahead of the press conference it said it expected that share to rise to 70% this year. Analysts at Gartner said they expected Apple to maintain its lead and increase the volume of tablets sold - but added that the launch did not contain any news to cause them to increase their ""bullish"" forecasts. ""I'd call the new iPad an evolutionary device with some revolutionary experiences,"" said research director Michael Gartenberg. Others expressed disappointment following the news noting that the new device's display did not include haptic touch-feedback technology or access to the iPhone 4S' voice-controlled Siri ""intelligent assistant"" as rumoured. ""As tablets are increasingly being used for personal media consumption, it is promising to see a better screen resolution,"" said Fred Huet, managing director of Greenwich Consulting. ""But will this be enough to ensure Apple's competitive lead in the marketplace? No."" However, the new iPad won praise from journalists at Engadget who were among the first to try out the tablet. They noted that the improved screen resolution should lead to improved apps. ""Apple just put an insane amount of real estate in the hands of crafty developers, and frankly, we can't wait to see what they cook up,""wrote Darren Murphy. Apple's shares closed 0.08% higher on Wall Street at $530.69.",Apple has unveiled a new iPad with a high-definition screen.
"Federal investigators say Tesla ""lacked understanding"" of the semi-autonomous Autopilot's limitations. The NTSB recommended that car manufacturers and regulators take steps to ensure such systems are not misused. It said the collision should never have happened. The crash, in May 2016, led to the death of Tesla driver Joshua Brown, 40. The driver of the truck, which was pulling a trailer, was unhurt. ""In this crash, Tesla's system worked as designed, but it was designed to perform limited tasks in a limited range of environments,"" Christopher Hart, a member of the NTSB said in a meeting to discuss the findings of its investigation. ""Tesla allowed the driver to use the system outside of the environment for which it was designed, and the system gave far more leeway to the driver to divert his attention to something other than driving."" Semi-autonomous driving In June, the NTSB released a 500-page report stating that in 37 minutes of driving, Mr Brown had his hands on the wheel for just 25 seconds. At the time, the lorry driver told the Associated Press that Mr Brown had been watching a Harry Potter film when the collision occurred. However, the NTSB said today that there was no evidence that Mr Brown was watching a film while he was driving. The safety board added that the lorry driver refused to be interviewed for its investigation. Primary factors The NTSB found that both Mr Brown and the lorry driver had sufficient sight distance to afford time for either party to have acted to prevent the collision. The investigation found that Mr Brown's inattention and the lorry driver's unwillingness to give way were both primary factors of the crash. The investigators could not find a reason why Mr Brown was inattentive. However, they confirmed that neither driver was fatigued or impaired by alcohol and drugs, and neither driver was distracted by a mobile device. Following the meeting, the NTSB's report included seven safety recommendations requiring car manufacturers to add safeguards to prevent automated vehicle control systems from being used outside the conditions for which they were designed. ""At Tesla, the safety of our customers comes first, and one thing is very clear: Autopilot significantly increases safety, as NHTSA has found that it reduces accident rates by 40%,"" the car-maker said in a statement. ""We appreciate the NTSB's analysis of last year's tragic accident and we will evaluate their recommendations as we continue to evolve our technology. ""We will also continue to be extremely clear with current and potential customers that Autopilot is not a fully self-driving technology and drivers need to remain attentive at all times.""",The US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has found that Tesla's Autopilot system was partly to blame for a fatal accident in which a Model S collided with a lorry.
"NHS staff have used Frontline.Live, launched on Saturday, to report a lack of life-saving equipment such as hand sanitiser, masks, goggles and gowns. They can tweet the items they need, their work postcode, a photo and the hashtag #FrontlineMap or, and to remain anonymous, complete an online form. At least 19 NHS staff have died with coronavirus. The PPE requests are plotted on a real-time map that can be viewed by policymakers and suppliers. Frontline.Live is a collaboration between technologists, social-enterprise founders and volunteers. It was initiated after serial entrepreneur Katz Kiely, chief executive of innovation agency Beep, and her team identified 25,000 tweets last month from NHS staff about PPE shortages. “We just felt like we needed to make a difference,” Ms Kiely told BBC News. Military help “We thought if we had live open data, that could only help the decision-makers make better decisions.” Those working in care homes and sheltered housing can also make PPE requests via Frontline.Live. The government says there is enough PPE to go around and it has called in the military to help with distribution. However, many NHS workers are still experiencing shortages. Supplies of gowns, for example, are critically low in some hospitals, according to Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers in England. Royal College of Surgeons of England president elect Prof Neil Mortensen said: “We need to protect our medical, dental and nursing staff as they put themselves in harms way for us. “Ready availability of appropriate personal protection equipment is the key to keeping them safe. ""An open data platform that shows front-line needs in real time can help us do just that.”",A new web-based app is allowing front-line workers to report personal protective equipment (PPE) shortages.
"By Chris BaraniukTechnology reporter At the push of a button, the vehicle's ""highway pilot"" helped it avoid other road users via a radar and camera sensing system. The company reiterated the requirement that a human driver be present and focused on the road at all times. Earlier in the year, Daimler had expressed its desire to carry out such a test by the end of 2015. ""As soon as we are on the highway, we will start the autonomous driving mode,"" said Daimler executive Wolfgang Bernhard as he steered the Mercedes-Benz Actros truck towards a busy stretch of motorway in Baden-Wurttemberg last week. Then, at the push of a blue button on the vehicle's dashboard, the autonomous driving system took over. It successfully piloted the vehicle along the motorway, reaching speeds up to 80km/h (50mph). Mr Bernhard and Winfried Kretschmann, Minister-President for Baden-Wurttemberg, shared a coffee in the cab, as Mr Bernhard continued to describe how the technology worked. The system identifies markings on the road as well as other vehicles and obstacles with a camera and radar mounted at the front of the lorry. 'Never tired' At an earlier press event, Mr Bernhard had emphasised the system's reliability. ""The highway pilot brings more safety because it is never inattentive, it is never tired, it is always present 100%,"" he said. ""It never loses concentration or focus."" The lorry, he said, was, therefore, safer and more efficient than any human driver. ""No matter how well you accelerate, slow down or steer a truck you can never do it as good as the highway pilot can,"" he said. Alan Stevens, of the Transport Research Laboratory, told the BBC: ""I'm pleased that the trucks have proven safe enough to now undergo realistic road trials. ""Such trials are really the only way to understand the real economic and safety benefits. ""The behaviour of other drivers will be very interesting to see so I look forward to the result."" Driving Japanese News of Daimler's test comes as a Japanese company, Robot Taxi Inc, reveals a plan to provide self-driving cars to people in Kanagawa, just south of Tokyo, in 2016. About 50 people will be selected to take part in the trial. The cars will be able to self-drive only along a 3km stretch of public road in the area. Those selected for the trial will be accompanied by a human driver, who will control the vehicle at all other times, and a second person on-hand for safety reasons. The company is also hoping to provide self-driving vehicles to visitors to the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. Ultimately, it aims to develop driverless cars that require no human driver at all. ""Unlike many automakers, we are aiming for what the US government calls Level 4 driverless technology - which doesn't call for any human intervention,"" a spokesman told the BBC.","A driverless lorry developed by Daimler has been tested on a public road for the first time, in Germany."
"By Michael FitzpatrickTokyo There are even TV commercials that dominate the front of 10-storey buildings and animated pitchmen placed above urinals. So in an effort to grab attention, Japan's Mad Men have to work twice as hard to get their messages across. The country's biggest advertising outfit, Dentsu, thinks it may have an edge with the latest image recognition technology that encourages smartphone owners to snap at ads, magazine covers and even the seemingly empty ether above their heads with their camera-equipped mobiles. In return, users of Dentsu's Scan It app are rewarded by being whisked to the advertiser's website or receiving special offers, free music, film clips and digital coupons. ""We plan to use Scan It as content for digital and smartphone campaigns,"" says Mr Naoki Mori, a creative director at Dentsu, Tokyo and the mastermind behind the new marketing drive. Bonus material Dentsu also plans to use its tool for adding bonus material in newspapers, magazines and even product packaging, he adds. The technology is basically a much advanced version of the 2D barcodes - known as QR codes - for mobiles that surfaced recently in the West and have been used for years in Japan. QR (Quick Response) codes are small, square printed bar-coded tattoos that resemble a splattered space invader icon and are printed on posters and billboards, and in magazines. They provide a quick means for anyone with a camera-enabled phone to access web addresses housing everything from information on competitions to addresses and maps for retail outlets. Instead of tapping out of web addresses, users just snap the code and let their smartphone do the rest. Dentsu's Scan It application, available on the iPhone, works on a similar principle only it is trained to recognise normal, flat printed images using a method, which for the moment, Dentsu is unwilling to reveal. Hidden histories So far, Scan It is only configured to work with images in a sports car catalogue, the cover of popular Manga magazine Jump SQ and, more curiously, Japanese banknotes. Photographing the portrait of Hideyo Noguchi, the bacteriologist who discovered the agent of syphilis who features on a 1000 Yen note, launches a film detailing the history of Japanese money. Capture Jump magazine's front cover, and a free animated Manga tale starts up on your smartphone screen. ""You can see the potential,"" says Paul Papadimitriou, mobile technology consultant and publisher of the mobileinjapan.com blog. ""There's lots to do with such an app: scan an ad and get to a campaign site. Imagine - scan a pack of gum and get to an micro site; scan a dedicated image in a shop and get a coupon. Treasure-hunt all images, scan them and win some prize. It's QR code redux,"" he adds. The technology used means the phone actually recognises that picture, unlike technology such as Google Goggles that analyses the image then compares it those on the internet to create a list of related pictures and sites. With images acting as QR codes alternatives, it sends users to specific sites, eliminating the guess work. Picture perfect Similar image recognition technology is also emerging elsewhere. Zurich-based Kooaba, for example, has created what it calls Smart Visuals - a technology it says matches that of Dentsu's. By using image recognition technology and the automatic crawling of a large reference database of objects, Kooaba's Smart Visuals apps can recognise printed and digital images taken with a smartphone, web cam or any other digital camera. ""Our algorithms determine and discriminate regions in images and are able to subsequently match them to other views of the same object,"" says Kooaba founder Herbert Bay. ""By relying on regions in the image rather than on the whole image, we are able to identify the correct match even under challenging conditions,"" he adds. Kooaba claims Smart Visuals works well for all kinds of pictures, including book covers, DVDs, games, newspapers and magazines, even buildings. However, images of animals, plants, cars, furniture, or apparel are not common in its database and consequently do not work so well with its current software. In future, it may be possible to add face recognition too, say both Dentsu and Kooaba. But the Swiss company is more cautious: ""Besides the technological challenges there are also serious privacy issues,"" it says. So far Kooaba has used Smart Visuals to create mobile apps such as Kooaba Paperboy, which makes print media interactive via smartphones. Instead of making a mental note to download or share an article you may be reading in a newspaper, you can snap the page with your iPhone and be taken to a results page, where you can share it with friends, bookmark a digital version, or go to a related web page. So far this neat trick is only available in a few European countries, but the firm hopes to roll out the service world-wide making a wide range of print titles interactive with a smartphone. The service will be free of charge to publishers, says Mr Bay. Butterfly effect Dentsu meanwhile plans to add augmented reality (AR) functions to its app similar to those demonstrated in Japan with ""iButterfly"" - an entertaining iPhone application that uses AR, the iPhone's camera, motion sensor and GPS functions to collect coupons. This had users all over Japan this summer chasing virtual butterflies, only visible to iPhone users. Once spotted on screen, a deft flick with the phone would capture the fluttering AR butterfly and reward the user with a coupon. Adding this AR function to future versions of Scan It will enable the app to interact with 3D objects as well says Dentsu. Shopping in the future then could take a sci-fi turn. The ability to augment your knowledge about an object by just looking at it via your phone's camera would help you bring up information about a product and where to buy it. At which point the whole world becomes a billboard and the ad mans job to stand out begins again.","Tokyo is probably the most ad-soaked fragment of the planet. Bombarded by visuals shilling something, to someone, somewhere, advertisers vie constantly to attract eyeballs."
"By Zoe KleinmanTechnology reporter In tests, it achieved a 98.5% success rate among people who had received an official positive coronavirus test result, rising to 100% in those who had no other symptoms. The researchers would need regulatory approval to develop it into an app. They said the crucial difference in the sound of an asymptomatic-Covid-patient cough could not be heard by human ears. 'Pool testing' The artificial-intelligence (AI) algorithm was built at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) lab. MIT scientist Brian Subirana, who co-authored the paper, published in the IEEE Journal of Engineering in Medicine and Biology, said: ""The way you produce sound changes when you have Covid, even if you're asymptomatic."" ""Practical use cases could be for daily screening of students, workers and public, as schools, jobs, and transport reopen, or for pool testing to quickly alert of outbreaks in groups,"" the report says. Several organisations, including Cambridge University, Carnegie Mellon University and UK health start-up Novoic, have been working on similar projects. Sample sounds In July, Cambridge's Covid-19 Sounds project reported an 80% success rate in identifying positive coronavirus cases based on a combination of breath and cough sounds. By May, it had a dataset of 459 cough and breath sample sounds submitted by 378 members of the public, and it says it now has around 30,000 recordings. But the MIT lab has collected about 70,000 audio samples each containing a number of coughs. Of those, 2,500 are from people with confirmed cases of coronavirus. 'Detect cancer' Artificial-intelligence expert Calum Chace described the algorithm as ""a classic piece of AI"". ""It's the same principle as feeding a machine a lot of X-rays so it learns to detect cancer,"" he said. ""It's an example of AI being helpful. ""And, for once, I don't see a lot of downside in this.""",An algorithm developed in the US has correctly identified people with Covid-19 only by the sound of their coughs.
"Culver City's fire service said the Tesla had ""ploughed into the rear"" of one of its fire engines parked at the scene of an accident on Monday. The car's owner subsequently claimed it had been in Autopilot mode at the time. The GM incident resulted in a collision with a motorbike in San Francisco. The rider says the car - which was using GM's Cruise Automation technology - caused him serious injury and is now suing GM, according to local newspaper The Mercury News. GM has alleged the motorcyclist was at fault. The event dates back to December, but has come to light only now. Car-makers suggest self-drive technologies should make the roads safer, but at present California requires a driver to remain behind the wheel so they can retake control at short notice. However, the state's Department of Motor Vehicles is currently considering new regulations that would allow tests on public roads without a human sitting in the driver's seat. The US National Transportation Board (NTSB) has said it will investigate the Tesla crash. According to a tweet by the Culver City Firefighters, the Model S was travelling at 65mph (105km/h) when the impact occurred. ""Amazingly, there were no injuries,"" an official said. Tesla has the ability to analyse data gathered by its vehicles' on-board computers to determine the cause of crashes, and has shared information with the press about previous high-profile accidents. However, for now the car company has limited itself to saying that ""Autopilot is intended for use only with a fully attentive driver"" and that it has instructed drivers to keep their hands on the steering wheel while employing it. The NTSB previously investigated Tesla after a Model S crash in 2016 in which the driver died. It held the company partly accountable saying the Autopilot system had given the victim ""leeway... to divert his attention to something other than driving"". Since the accident, Tesla has introduced an update that brings its cars to a halt if they detect a driver's hands are not on the wheel. 'Wobbled and fell' The Chevy Bolt accident was on 7 December during the morning commute. The injured motorcyclist, Oscar Nilsson, is a commercial photographer who had previously worked with GM and other car brands on commercial projects. According to an accident report filed by GM, its vehicle had been changing lanes when the gap ahead closed. While the Chevy Bolt had been re-centring itself in the original lane, GM said, a Honda motorcycle travelling at a faster speed had moved into the car's way, glanced off its side, wobbled and fallen over. ""Safety is our primary focus when it comes to developing and testing our self-driving technology,"" a GM spokesman told the BBC. ""In this matter, the SFPD [San Francisco Police Department] collision report stated that the motorcyclist merged into our lane before it was safe to do so."" However, Mr Nilsson disputes this account and alleges the car ""suddenly veered"" into his lane. His lawyer has further alleged the Chevy's back-up driver had tried to grab the wheel to prevent the accident but was too late to do so. ""Why don't these folks take some responsibility?"" the lawyer told the Mercury News. Mr Nilsson claims he has suffered neck and shoulder injuries, adding he has had to take sick leave, and is claiming damages. Details of the legal dispute have emerged a week after GM published its annual self-driving safety report. It also announced that it hoped to deploy test vehicles with no steering wheel or pedals as soon as next year.",Two vehicles reportedly engaged in self-drive modes - a Tesla Model S and a General Motors Chevy Bolt - have been involved in separate road accidents in California.
"Ashley Madison - 32m accounts leaked Last year, real-world account details of millions of people using the Ashley Madison site were leaked. They had all been using a site intended for married people who wanted to find somebody to cheat on their spouse with. In terms of numbers, this was not the biggest hack of recent years by a long shot. But it had a huge impact on peoples' lives. Some relationships ended. Other people lived in fear that their significant others - who might never have heard of the website before the breach - would find out they were looking for the chance to have affairs. The hack also damaged the firm's most valuable commodity - trust in its website. Ashley Madison had assured users they were entering an ""anonymous"" website, but their details were made public. It had even offered a ""delete"" service that turned out not to work. People who had paid $19 (£15) for a ""full delete"" found their names and email addresses were still on the searchable database. Two women explain how the Ashley Madison hack changed their lives But there were extremely serious consequences worldwide. Police in Canada said two people's suicides were linked to the data leakage. And activists warned that being publicly outed put many LGBT people at risk worldwide, especially in places where they might be beaten up or worse. TalkTalk - repeated breaches The UK phone and broadband provider TalkTalk suffered three data breaches in the course of a year. In one case, after hundreds of thousands of customer names and email address and 21,000 bank account details were hacked, police arrested six people under the age of 21. The company lost more than 100,000 subscribers in the third quarter of 2016 after that attack. Its profits more than halved, although it said part of that loss was due to the money it spent on boosting security. Why do companies keep getting hacked? MySpace - 359m logins put up for sale In May this year, hundreds of millions of passwords to the MySpace social media site went up for sale online. The logins were thought to have been stolen several years before. The techniques used to protect the passwords had been quite weak. MySpace said it had invalidated passwords used before 2013 and was using automated tools to ""identify and block"" suspicious activity. The website was long past its heyday, having been overtaken in popularity by sites like Facebook and Twitter, so the impact was not huge. But it may have put people at risk who were using the same password across multiple online accounts. LinkedIn accounts - 164m accounts compromised Also in May this year, the same person (or at least somebody with the same username) tried to sell more than 100 million logins for the LinkedIn business-focused and recruitment social network. These logins were four years old but third parties found some of the passwords still worked. The social network had tried to secure accounts after a previous, smaller, attack but some tech experts said they should have broadened their efforts to all users. Security researcher Troy Hunt was one of those to comment on the spate of events. He said there must be ""some catalyst"" behind why MySpace, Tumblr and LinkedIn hacks all came to light at the same time. What have companies changed about how they protect our data? It is hard to say. Companies tend to keep the methods used under wraps, and it is usually not until security details are breached that such information comes to light. As Steven Murdoch from University College London says: ""If the criminals don't know what security measures they're using, it's obviously better for the companies."" Quoting an old maxim, ""security through obscurity"", he says that although companies ""shouldn't depend on it, it does help"". Internet security experts agree that these hacks threw the spotlight onto the shortcomings of certain types of password protection. Rik Ferguson from the security software company Trend Micro says that one algorithm used by some of these companies, known as MD5, is 10 years out of date and that if they are still storing passwords ""the same way they have always done it"", then they are ""absolutely not doing anything"". He argues that all companies, no matter how small, should be using the techniques of ""salting and hashing"". ""Salting"" = adding random characters to every password to make it harder to break ""Hashing"" = turning the password's string of text into a string of numbers But all agree that some of the responsibility lies with people who are making passwords - that is, us. Unless, Dr Murdoch says, you do not care if your account is hacked. Then ""it really doesn't matter which password you use"".","As half a billion people's Yahoo account information appears to have been stolen by hackers , we take a look at the most well-known recent hacks and ask what happened next - for customers, companies and the rest of us."
"Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent@BBCRoryCJon Twitter The other day I got an excited call from a PR acting for Amazon. He told me that on Friday the online retailer was completely revamping its Lovefilm Instant streaming video offering in the UK. That sounds interesting - since Amazon bought Lovefilm three years ago it has struggled to make the streaming side of the business stand out against competitors like Netflix and Sky. But now, it seems, there is going to be compelling new content which will shake up the market. When the Facebook/WhatsApp story came along, I forgot about Amazon's video ambitions until this morning when I looked at their press release. The story begins to look slightly different. The headline reads ""The Countdown Begins - Unlimited Streaming of More than 15,000 Popular Movies and TV Episodes Coming to Amazon Prime Next Week."" The release goes on to explain that Amazon Prime, the service where you pay an annual fee to get faster delivery, is being combined with Lovefilm Instant. ""With the addition of Prime Instant Video"", it says, ""Prime will be offered at the low price of £79 a year - a 35% saving for what were previously separate services."" What does not appear in the release is one key fact - that Amazon Prime currently costs £49 a year, so the customers who currently want fast delivery but are not interested in the video service will now face a 60% price increase. Ah yes, says the Amazon PR team when I ask about this, but many customers are currently both Prime and Lovefilm Instant members, so combining the two is providing them great value. How many is ""many"" I want to know - what proportion of Prime customers are also paying for Lovefilm? ""We don't disclose exact figures on subscriptions"", comes the reply. ""Much like our competitors it's simply confidential information that we don't share publicly."" My guess is that only quite a small minority of customers have both services. Today's move appears to be designed as a way of cutting the high costs of delivering the Prime service, while boosting a video offering which has looked a little lightweight to many. That is a perfectly sensible business strategy for a firm which, like other web giants, wants its customers to spend more time in its company. But Amazon UK customers who look at the site today will see a message telling them about the ""great news"" about unlimited streaming of movies and TV episodes. What they won't see is any mention of a price rise. Perhaps most Amazon Prime customers will see an extra £30 a year as a good deal for a choice of 15,000 movies and programmes. Or perhaps they will look at the range of video content - not much stronger, as far as I can see - and decide not to renew their subscription. Amazon is undertaking what could be a dangerous experiment with consumer behaviour - though of course we are unlikely to be told the results.",Amazon has announced changes to its Lovefilm and Prime services. But are customers getting a better deal?
"The case marks the first time that the invention-acquiring business has been awarded a payout by a jury. Intellectual Ventures charges others for the rights to use the inventions it has purchased and created, but makes few products of its own. Several critics have described it as ""the ultimate patent troll"". But Symantec was barred by the judge in the case from making use of the term. The ruling was not, however, a total victory for Intellectual Ventures. It had originally sought close to $300m in damages after claiming that three of its software cybersecurity patents had been infringed by Symantec. The Delaware jury ruled that only two of the patents had in fact been infringed: While the jury recognised that a third patent - describing a way to detect spam - was also valid, it decided it had not been infringed by Symantec. Furthermore, it rejected Intellectual Venture's demand for continuing royalty payments. ""We are grateful to the jury for their hard work and for confirming the validity of these patents,"" responded Melissa Finocchio, chief litigation counsel for Intellectual Ventures. ""We remain committed to defending inventor rights and protecting the interests of our investors and customers."" A spokesman for Symantec said: ""We are pleased the verdict came back for substantially less than the amount that Intellectual Ventures was seeking, and are considering our options to reduce the damages even further."" 'Most hated' Intellectual Ventures had already settled claims involving the same patents with Check Point and Intel's McAfee division. But Trend Micro - another security firm - has also refused to pay. Its dispute is set to go to court in May. California-based Intellectual Ventures - which was founded by Microsoft's former chief technology officer Nathan Myhrvold - initially avoided suing other companies directly. Instead, for about a decade, much of its business model relied on licensing its inventions to others, so that they could use them defensively or offensively in their own disputes. However, its strategy changed in December 2010, when it filed cases of its own against nine companies, including Symantec. The first of these disputes, which was against Motorola Mobility - then owned by Google, came to court last year. But the judge ruled it a mis-trial after the jurors could not agree on a verdict. Bloomberg Businessweek subsequently described Intellectual Ventures as ""Silicon Valley's most hated patent troll"", saying it hoarded ideas and wielded its intellectual property portfolio ""like a weapon"". However, Mr Myhrvold has argued that his business benefits both the inventors it buys patents from and the researchers it employs itself. ""The world needs more inventions and my goal is to show that investing in invention is a good way of ensuring it gets them, provided you have the resources to scale this model up,"" he said. Android patents In a separate development, Microsoft has announced that a patent dispute with Samsung over unpaid fees has been resolved. The Windows-developer had claimed the South Korean firm had failed to pay it on schedule for the use of inventions that featured in the Android operating system. Although Google leads development of Android, Microsoft lays claim to some of the processes the software uses and has successfully pursued dozens of manufacturers for payments. Microsoft began legal action against Samsung in 2013. However, it has provided little detail about how the matter had been resolved. ""Samsung and Microsoft are pleased to announce that they have ended their contract dispute,"" it said it in a brief statement. ""Terms of the agreement are confidential.""","Intellectual Ventures - the self-proclaimed ""world's largest buyer"" of patents - has won a $17m (£11.1m) court victory against security firm Symantec."

The US Consumer Safety Commission (CPSC) said more than six million of the affected cables had been sold in the US and Canada alone.

The announcement comes nine months after a separate issue forced the company to pull its Chromebook laptops from sale after reports that their chargers had been overheating. Minor burns The latest case involves power cords marked with LS-15 on their sides that were sold alongside HP and Compaq ""notebook"" and ""mini notebook"" PCs as well as other hardware.

A CPSC webpage adds details of previous incidents: ""HP has received 29 reports of power cords overheating and melting or charring resulting in two claims of minor burns and 13 claims of minor property damage."" HP is not the only computer-maker to have been involved in such action over recent months:","HP has ordered a worldwide recall of power cords that had been sold with its laptop computers and other accessories, including docking stations."
"Media exposure of live facial recognition at the site prompted the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) to look into how it was being used. The ICO will inspect the technology in place and how it is operated to ensure it does not break data protection laws. The regulator said it was ""deeply concerned"" about the growing use of facial-recognition technology. Fair and transparent The Financial Times was the first to report a live face-scanning system was being used across the 67-acre (0.3-sq-km) site around King's Cross station in London. Developer Argent said it used the technology to ""ensure public safety"" and it was just one of ""a number of detection and tracking methods"" in place at the site. But the use of cameras and databases to work out who is passing through and using the site has proved controversial. So far, Argent has not said how long it has been using facial-recognition cameras, what is the legal basis for their use, or what systems it has in place to protect the data it collects. In its statement, the ICO said: ""Scanning people's faces as they lawfully go about their daily lives, in order to identify them, is a potential threat to privacy that should concern us all."" The regulator said it was keen to ensure that King's Cross developer was using the technology in accordance with UK laws governing the use of data. ""Put simply, any organisations wanting to use facial recognition technology must comply with the law - and they must do so in a fair, transparent and accountable way,"" said the ICO. It must have documented how and why it believed its use of the technology was legal, proportionate and justified, it added. Argent has not yet responded to a request for comment by BBC News. The mayor of London is also quizzing developer Argent about its use of facial-recognition systems. Sadiq Khan wrote to the company and said there was ""serious and widespread concern"" about the legality of facial recognition.",The facial-recognition system at King's Cross is to be investigated by the UK's data-protection watchdog.
"It follows the arrest of an Uber driver in the city who is accused of raping a female passenger. In response the Delhi authorities banned all net-based taxi services. Uber apologised for what happened and acknowledged that it ""must do better"". It will conduct a full audit of the way it screens drivers. ""We are sorry and deeply saddened by what happened over the weekend in New Delhi. Our hearts go out to the victim of this horrible crime. We have been [doing] and will continue to do everything in our power to assist the authorities to help bring the perpetrator to justice,"" Uber India said in a statement. Previously the taxi service, which uses an online platform to connect drivers and passengers, had said that it would work with organisations in the city championing women's safety. This latest apology goes further: ""The events of this week have made us reflect on our operations in India and we are immediately undertaking a number of important actions. During this review we will suspend operations in New Delhi,"" it said. Acknowledging that ""we must do better"", the US-based firm promised to conduct a full audit of its rider feedback processes. ""We are implementing measures to ensure that critical rider feedback is escalated immediately and immediate action is taken in every instance. ""We are also re-reviewing rider feedback on every driver partner across India to make sure nothing has been missed."" It said it would also assess all driver screening processes and look at whether additional screening options and background checks are necessary. The way it screens its drivers has come in for close scrutiny not just in India but in other cities around the world. Two Californian cities, Los Angeles and San Francisco, are taking legal action against the firm, partly over the quality of its background checks.",Internet-based taxi firm Uber has said that it will suspend operations in Delhi while it reviews its service in India.
"Somebody added the illegal images to the core ledger of Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV) by using a payment processor. This ledger, known as the blockchain, is a running record of crypto-currency transactions, shared among users of the platform. Experts have warned that abuse of blockchain tech is a growing problem. How did this happen? The blockchain is central to the way many crypto-currencies such as Bitcoin work and in theory stops people making fake transactions or manipulating their account balance. One key feature of the blockchain is that information added to it cannot be changed without significant effort. In January, the amount of data that could be added to the BSV blockchain was increased significantly. Before that, people could generally add only short chunks of text or web links to the blockchain. But now it is possible to add full images in an encoded format. Payment system Money Button said its service had been used to post the illegal images on the BSV blockchain in early February. UK laws state that the simple possession of indecent photographs of children is an offence and any distribution of such material can warrant a longer prison sentence. Zero tolerance Jimmy Nguyen, founder of crypto-cash company nChain, which oversees the BSV currency, said it had ""zero tolerance"" for illegal use of the system. ""The Bitcoin SV blockchain is not a place for criminal activity - and if you use it for illegal purposes, you will leave a digitally signed evidence trail that cannot be erased,"" he told BBC News. ""We stand ready to work with global law enforcement authorities to stamp out this and any other illegal misuse of Bitcoin."" Ryan Charles, founder of Money Button, said: ""Since most businesses increased the size of allowed data recently, making it possible to post large files, criminals are trying to push the limits."" Easily accessible The abuse images embedded in the BSV blockchain were spotted when they appeared on Bitcoinfiles.org. The website lets people browse a rolling list of messages and other content added to the blockchain. The appearance of the images prompted police to investigate. Bitcoinfiles.org has since closed the blockchain browsing service. In addition, Money Button has banned the user that uploaded the material. It has also put in place filtering systems to spot when anyone tries to upload similar content. Money Button is part-funded by nChain. ""Criminals should understand that everything on the blockchain is signed, time-stamped, and linked to everything else,"" said Mr Charles. ""We have all the information we need to track down criminals and prosecute them."" Information about the person who uploaded the images has been passed to the authorities. 'Not yet mature' Eric Erstu, who runs the Cryptograffiti website that lets people read messages embedded in the Bitcoin blockchain, said: ""There is nothing that could have prevented this from happening in other blockchains. ""It takes special care to seek and find illegal content from any block chain, as it is not a trivial process,"" he told BBC News. ""As for law enforcement, they would have to do the good old detective work in hope of tracking down the person who uploaded the illegal content on the block chain. ""Since everything you do on the blockchain is immutable, tracking down criminals is not too difficult."" Blockchain researcher Roman Matzutt, from the University of Aachen, in Germany, who has studied the problem of people uploading illegal content to the blockchain, warned it had become a ""pressing issue"". He said there was ""ongoing research"" to find ways to remove such content from blockchains but these were ""not yet mature"". And there was a ""lack of sufficient sustainable solutions apart from making content insertion into public blockchains hard"".",Images of child sexual abuse have been found embedded in the system powering a high-profile crypto-currency.
"The US maintained its position, holding first and second place with the two most powerful computers in the world. At number one is Summit, with peak processing power of 200 petaflops - 200 quadrillion calculations per second.

That is an increase of 10% from six months ago, when the combined processing power reached 1.41 exaflops. One exaflop is roughly equivalent to every human on Earth doing calculation per second, for four years. The combined power of the Top500 could more than double in 2021, as the US is expected to fire up two new supercomputers, Frontier and Aurora, which each pack at least one exaflop.

"By James Waterhouse and Kirsty GrantBBC Victoria Derbyshire programme ""It's like a proper business,"" the 26-year-old says. ""It's like people that sing, or go and gig, or artists that sell their own paintings. I'm just selling pictures and videos of me."" Jodie refers to herself as a ""Snapchat Premium girl"". For a monthly fee - of between £20 and £200 - she sends her subscribers sexually explicit photos and videos via the regular Snapchat app. Such material is banned and removed when found, Snapchat says, but Jodie has been doing it since 2016. She advertises her service on other social media sites such as Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, and says she is careful to check the accounts belong to real people before accepting. But it has also led to her receiving many hurtful comments - sent online from those who object to what she does for a living. They contain offensive language. ""People call me 'slut' and things like that. And it does upset me,"" she explains. Within 20 minutes of filming with the Victoria Derbyshire programme, she receives a message from a man she has never spoken to before that reads: ""You are a hoe though. You're gorgeous, don't get me wrong, but shame you sell your body or pictures. No morals unfortunately in this world."" Jodie explains: ""I get a message like that every hour, or every half an hour, all day long. ""Tonight my friend will say, 'How did filming go?'... and then I'll break down. ""But,"" she reflects, ""I was miserable in my office job, and I love the money."" Maintaining her Snapchat has now become her full-time job, she explains, often because her 40 or so subscribers demand extra material. Content can range from a striptease to videos of her masturbating. Lawyers say no laws are being broken by those selling such content, unless they do so to under-18s or upload especially depraved material. But as a result of the Victoria Derbyshire programme showing Instagram its findings, that social media site has now blocked all hashtags associated with Premium Snapchat that were being used by people to advertise their services. Snapchat said in a statement it does not allow ""pornographic content to be promoted or distributed"". ""Accounts that privately distribute pornographic content are an intentional abuse of the terms of service of our platform,"" it added in a statement. ""We remove them when reported."" Hurtful comments Jodie sees Snapchat as a safe environment to make money, as she says she never needs to meet her clients. ""I'm not an escort. I've been offered thousands of pounds to meet men and I say 'no',"" she explains. But she admits it has also taken a toll on her personal life. She has not had a boyfriend for months and says many men judge her. ""They don't really want to date me after [I tell them my job]. Or they do, but for the wrong reasons,"" she says. And she admits her family is concerned about the long-term implications. Jodie allows her subscribers who pay her £200 a month to save the material she sends them to their phones. It means she loses control of the content, and does not know how it will be used. 'Future careers ruined' Laura Higgins, who founded the Revenge Porn Helpline, argues more protections are needed. She says the charity receives regular calls from people like Jodie, who have been blackmailed or had their future careers ruined by the resurfacing of sexual content they originally sold online. And she says the videos they produce can even go on to be used by others for sextortion - luring men to send explicit pictures of themselves to what they think is a good-looking woman, and then blackmailing them. A spokesperson for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said it expected ""online platforms to... ensure the services they offer are age appropriate"". It added: ""Working with tech companies, children's charities and other stakeholders, we are developing new laws to help make the UK the safest place in the world to be online."" Jodie explains she will continue selling material on Snapchat ""until it's not convenient for me any more"". She says the money - four times what she earned before - makes it worth it, having struggled to afford to feed herself two years ago. And it allows her to live a flexible lifestyle. But she does not hide the downsides. ""When [sexualised comments are] the only attention you're getting as a woman, it can make you feel quite worthless,"" she says. ""All I get is like, 'show me your boobs' or 'I want to see you in underwear now', or 'you're dirty, you're filthy'. ""I sometimes cry. It's very upsetting, because I don't actually get any nice attention."" Follow the Victoria Derbyshire programme on Facebook and Twitter - and see more of our stories here.","Snapchat is being used to sell explicit images and videos online, the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme has found. Jodie says she makes £4,000 a month on the app, but it's not without a cost to her personal life, and she has been subject to online abuse."
"By Prof William WebbChief technology officer, Neul A world where each parking space is monitored and cars directed to specific empty slots as they enter a city. For all those sitting on the M25 yet again or driving round and round a multi-storey car park this may seem fantasy, but in principle it is a dream we could bring about. Monitoring traffic flow is relatively easy, as is deducing where congestion is occurring and working out where to reroute cars. But there is a big piece missing from the puzzle at the moment - a way to get information from sensors to control centres and from control centres back to cars, traffic lights, roadside signage and more. Cost concerns Wireless connectivity is the only viable solution. For moving vehicles this is obviously so, but even for sensors such as those on bridges or embedded into car-parking spaces, the cost of running wires to each one would be prohibitive. In a world of the iPhone and mobile broadband it is easy to imagine this connectivity problem is solved. It isn't. A mobile broadband connection into each car-parking space would be very expensive both in terms of the electronics needed and the cellular subscription to be paid. Batteries would need changing far too often to be viable. And all those sensors would load the cellular networks to such a level that there would be no capacity left for people to access Facebook. Mobile networks are great for people but terrible for machines. The needs and applications are so different that trying to use one network for both is like combining goods trains with passenger expresses. In fact, the reason we don't yet have a congestion-free world is that we don't have a wireless network designed for sensors, traffic lights, or more generally ""machines"". Sleep mode Such a network would share many characteristics with mobile networks. It would consist of base stations located across the country, providing coverage everywhere - ideally better than today's cellular networks. Wireless chips, embedded in machines, would ""talk"" to these base stations and messages would be routed across networks to control centres. But the wireless technology would be quite different. It would deliberately use much lower data rates than mobile broadband in order to allow greater range, simpler and cheaper chip sets and longer battery life. It would be optimised for large numbers of short messages sent intermittently rather than rapid connection and multi-media download. It would allow machines to ""sleep"" for much of the time to conserve their batteries for up to 10 years. It would require only low-power transmitters to keep the cost of a chip set to about £1. It would allow for broadcast messages to groups of machines, such as all traffic lights in a city. If we had such a network we could embed wireless connectivity everywhere - not just in cars, parking spaces and traffic lights, but in electricity meters, heart-rate monitors, cat collars, washing machines… the list is endless. Finding spectrum To date such a network has not emerged due to a combination of a lack of vision and a lack of radio spectrum. Spectrum is a rarely mentioned necessity for all wireless communications, although occasionally it makes the headlines, as in 2000 when a chunk of cellular spectrum was sold in the UK for £22bn. Spectrum comes in different shapes and sizes (well, different frequencies and bandwidths, to be precise) and a machine system needs spectrum with very particular characteristics. It needs spectrum where radio signals travel far, where there is enough capacity for perhaps one billion devices in the UK alone, and crucially spectrum that is much less expensive than £22bn because car park sensors won't pay as much per month as iPhone users. Only recently has some spectrum that fits these characteristics been found, and work is still under way in the UK to make it available for commercial use. 'Weightless' wireless Based on this, engineers in my company and others, many belonging to institutions such as the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers), have got together to develop a standardised technology that will work well with the spectrum identified - ""white space spectrum"" - and be optimal for machines. This technology is called ""Weightless"" although if all goes to plan you may never hear about it. We expect Weightless chips to fall rapidly to around £1 each, to be embedded everywhere and for nationwide and indeed global networks to be deployed from 2013 onwards. Weightless chips will communicate behind the scenes with networks, databases and control centres making things work better - traffic will flow well, meters will be read automatically and washing machines will be able to send your smartphone a message telling you their outlet pipe is getting blocked. So when your car journey to work becomes congestion-free you'll know that it is ""wait-less"" because of a standard called ""Weightless"". It might just change our world. Professor William Webb is a Fellow of the IEEE and the chief technology officer of Neul, one of the companies behind the Weightless standard. He is the author of the recently published book Understanding Weightless.","The executive chairman of Ford, Bill Ford Jr, recently set out a vision of a world mostly free of traffic congestion as intelligent systems watched over traffic flow and directed vehicles accordingly."
"By Chris BaraniukTechnology reporter Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks work by overloading websites or other online services with traffic. They have the power to knock whole sites offline and are usually carried out by automated bots or programs. Victims of such attacks in the past month include the Irish National Lottery and the BBC while in 2014 the popular videogame Wurm was also hit. 'Arms race' Darren Antsee, chief security technologist at software company Arbor Networks, believes the world is in an ""arms race"" between those carrying out DDoS attacks and those who try to defend against them His firm conducts an annual survey of internet service providers on the subject and the company also takes in data from its ""Atlas"" system - which monitors 300 providers every hour. Mr Antsee says this gives the firm an idea of what's happening across ""about a third of the internet"". A newly published report from the company suggests attacks are getting bigger and more sophisticated - with more and more businesses suffering. More than 200 of the reported attacks in 2015 summoned 100 gigabits per second (Gbps) of traffic, with the largest of these clocking in at 500 Gbps - enough to disrupt an entire internet service provider's network. To put that in context, in 2014 internet connectivity for the entire country of Kenya was about 500 Gbps. But Mr Antsee says the larger attacks are not the real story. Instead, it's the ""big jump"" in more sophisticated DDoS raids which, though smaller in terms of gigabits per second, target specific parts of a website which are more easily overwhelmed. Petty cyber crime These often involve some clever analysis of how a website functions before an attack is launched, according to John Graham-Cumming, chief technology officer at DDoS protection service Cloudflare. ""If you know that, say, on an e-commerce website, adding something to the basket takes a long time, what we'll see is attackers doing that over and over again to consume resources,"" he says. What's even more worrying is that there is now a wide range of ""booter"" services which offer to launch DDoS against specific targets for as little as $10 (£7). ""My sense is that DDoS is just part of the internet at this point - it happens,"" adds Mr Graham-Cumming. ""It's a bit like petty crime."" Many motives Mr Antsee concurs and points out that a variety of motivations could prompt attacks these days. The most common now, according to the Arbor Networks survey, is criminals flexing their muscles against online targets to demonstrate their capabilities. Businesses occasionally dabble in attacking competitors, and there are also reports of individuals using DDoS for extortion - in which a ransom fee is demanded from the owners of a victim site. Finally, it's also sometimes the case that DDoS attacks will take place for ""ideological"" reasons - a website supporting a political viewpoint might be thrown offline by supporters of the opposing view, for example. In terms of protection, companies like Cloudflare offer to analyse web traffic for signs of malicious requests which can often weed out unwanted connections. Mr Antsee adds that ""infrastructure access control lists"" (ACLs) can be installed in routers and switches to detect suspicious patterns in traffic. Information overload However, the more sophisticated attacks mentioned above which target weak points in a website's structure are not always preventable with such technology. ""You need to be using more intelligent DDoS mitigation systems to absorb that kind of traffic,"" says Mr Antsee. Interestingly, he also comments that there is quite a large disparity between the number of attacks like this detected by service providers and the number seen by businesses - suggesting that more might need to be done before their true scale is understood. As a result of these developments, it is widely expected that the market for DDoS protection services is set to grow this year. Indeed, 74% of service providers surveyed by Arbor said they had seen an increase in such protections among their customers. ""We certainly don't see things slowing down, the reality is, for a lot of websites, it's easy to knock them offline and so people do it,"" notes Mr Graham-Cumming. He adds that these days, it seems as though anyone could be a target. ""Who gets DDoS'd? It's everybody, really.""",Cyber-attacks that bring down websites and online services have been getting bigger every year. But how will businesses cope in 2016?
"The retailer said it was investigating after discovering that thieves had gained access to its payment systems. The data breach began around 29 November, known as Black Friday, one of the busiest shopping days of the year. The attackers are believed to have been scooping up credit card details for almost three weeks. ""We take this matter very seriously and are working with law enforcement to bring those responsible to justice,"" said Target boss Gregg Steinhafel in a statement. In addition, he said, the company was working with a data forensics firm to work out how the theft occurred. Data-stealing code Target said the thieves had taken credit card numbers, names, expiration dates and security codes for the cards. It urged people who shopped at its stores in the vulnerable period to check credit card records and query unusual activity. ""We regret any inconvenience this may cause,"" said Mr Steinhafel. Security researcher Brian Krebs, writing about the breach, said sources at credit card payment processing firms had told him the thieves had installed data-stealing code on to card-swipe machines at tills in all 1,797 Target stores. It is not yet clear how the attackers managed to get their malicious program on to point-of-sale equipment in the stores. The thieves stole data between Thanksgiving and 15 December, said Target. The US Secret Service, which has official responsibility for investigating financial fraud, told Reuters it was looking into the breach. The largest ever credit card breach at a US retailer took place in 2007 when cyber-thieves managed to steal information related to almost 46 million credit and debit cards from TJ Maxx and Marshalls. The thieves amassed the huge cache of data over an 18 month period after penetrating the retailers' computer network. Your comments I am a British ex-pat living in the US. My wife and I regularly shop at Target and typically use a credit card as payment - whether online or in the store. My wife also has a store credit card through Target. This news is very disconcerting as I know we have shopped at Target at least a couple of times during the reported period. Our credit company (American Express) has been very good at identifying anomalies in the past and dealing with fraudulent transactions, so between us and the company checking activity on the cards I am hopeful we will not be caught out. Russell Hitchen, St Petersburg, Florida It's becoming apparent that the system of handing a card with personal and financial details to a store clerk is outdated as it seems the criminals have more technological savvy than those who are supposed to protect us from this kind of fraud. We shop at Target all the time but in the future we will pay cash until the problem is resolved. If ever... Peter O'Brien, Monroe, New Jersey Target is my go to store for everything. So concerned after reading this news piece. Have to go though my credit card statement to make sure I see don't see any anomalies. Fariha, Fremont, California I did shop at Target during that time and this just isn't that surprising to me. Isn't that sad? I have already had my credit card number stolen twice this year, despite being careful. I've begun monitoring my credit card transactions on a daily basis because this has just become so common. Amy Kolinko, Dublin, Ohio Interestingly enough, I work for a credit card processing company. I also happened to shop at Target over the course of Black Friday. My thoughts, as we move into a world where electronic payment methods are becoming more widely used, we must take a step back and evaluate why they are so convenient in the fist place. This convenience is obviously coming at a cost, and that cost is our privacy. This goes into the broader discussion of how the web has been used and is currently used to illicit intimate details of individuals. Getting back to the matter at hand, Target should have definitely invested more money in its security infrastructure, but at what point is security considered to be adequate? Will the 'hackers' always be one step ahead? Time can only tell, but my guess, this is an ongoing threat that will never truly be resolved completely. Omar Khalid, Astoria",Payment details from up to 40 million credit cards could have been stolen after they were used in the stores of US retail giant Target.
"Dave LeeNorth America technology reporter As these tools have become more powerful and easier to use, it has enabled the transfer of sexual fantasies from people's imaginations to the internet. It flies past not only the boundaries of human decency, but also our sense of believing what we see and hear. Beyond its use for hollow titillation, the sophistication of the technology could bring about serious consequences. The fake news crisis, as we know it today, may only just be the beginning. Several videos have already been made involving President Trump's face, and while they are obvious spoofs it's easy to imagine the effect being produced for propaganda purposes. As is typical, institutions and companies have been caught unaware and unprepared. The websites where this kind of material has begun to proliferate are watching closely. But most are clueless about what to do, and nervous about the next steps. Within communities experimenting with this technique, there is excitement as famous faces suddenly appear in an unlikely ""sex tape"". Only rarely do we see flickers of a heavy conscience as they discuss the true effects of what they are doing. Is creating a pornographic movie using someone's face unethical? Does it really matter if it is not real? Is anyone being hurt? Perhaps they should ask: How does this make the victim feel? As one user on Reddit put it, ""this is turning into an episode of Black Mirror"" - a reference to the dystopian science-fiction TV show. How are deepfakes created? One piece of software commonly being used to create these videos has, according to its designer, been downloaded more than 100,000 times since being made public less than a month ago. Doctoring sexually explicit images has been happening for over a century, but the process was often a painstaking one - considerably more so for altering video. Realistic edits required Hollywood-esque skills and budgets. But by using machine learning, that editing task has been condensed into three user-friendly steps: Gather a photoset of a person, choose a pornographic video to manipulate, and then just wait. Your computer will do the rest, though it can take more than 40 hours for a short clip. The most popular deepfakes feature celebrities, but the process works on anyone as long as you can get enough clear pictures of the person - not a particularly difficult task when people post so many selfies on social media. The technique is drawing attention from all over the world. Recently there has been a spike in searches for ""deepfake"" coming from internet users in South Korea. Spurred, it can be assumed, by the publishing of several manipulated videos depicting 23-year-old K-Pop star Seolhyun. ""This feels like it should be illegal,"" read a comment from one viewer. ""Great work!"" Celebrities targeted There are some celebrities in particular that seem to have attracted the most attention from deepfakers. It seems, anecdotally, to be driven by the shock factor: the extent to which a real explicit video involving this subject would create a scandal. Fakes depicting actress Emma Watson are among the most popular on deepfake communities, alongside those involving Natalie Portman. But clips have also been made of Michelle Obama, Ivanka Trump and Kate Middleton. Kensington Palace declined to comment on the issue. Gal Gadot, who played Wonder Woman, was one of the first deepfakes to demonstrate the possibilities of the technology. An article by technology news site Motherboard predicted it would take a year or so before the technique became automated. It ended up taking just a month. And as the practice draws more ire, some of the sites facilitating the sharing of such content are considering their options - and taking tentative action. Gfycat, an image hosting site, has removed posts it identified as being deepfakes - a task likely to become much more difficult in the not-too-distant future. Reddit, the community website that has emerged as a central hub for sharing, is yet to take any direct action - but the BBC understands it is looking closely at what it could do. A Google search for specific images can often suggest similar posts due to the way the search engine indexes discussions on Reddit. Google has in the past altered its search results in order to make it more difficult to find certain types of material - but it is not clear if Google is considering this kind of step at this early stage. Like the rest of us, these companies are only just becoming aware this kind of material exists. In recent years, these sites have wrestled with the problem of so-called ""revenge porn"", real images posted without the subject's consent as a way to embarrass or intimidate. Deepfakes add a new layer of complexity to what could be used to harass and shame people. A video may not be real - but the psychological damage most certainly would be. Political abuse It is a tech journalism cliche to say that one of the biggest drivers of innovation has historically been the porn business - whether it improved video compression, or was instrumental in the success of home video cassettes. As was the case then, what has begun here with porn could reach into other facets of life. In a piece for The Outline, journalist Jon Christian puts out a worst case scenario, that this technology ""could down the road be used maliciously to hoax governments and populations, or cause international conflict"". It is not a far-fetched threat. Fake news - whether satirical or malicious - is already shaping global debate and changing opinions, perhaps to the point of swaying elections. Combining advancements in audio technology, from companies such as Adobe, could combine fakery for both eyes and ears - tricking even the most astute news watcher. But for now, it is mostly porn. Those experimenting with this software do not skirt the issue. ""What we do here isn't wholesome or honourable, it's derogatory, vulgar, and blindsiding to the women that deepfakes works on,"" wrote one user on Reddit, before concocting the laughable suggestion that deepfakes might actually diminish the impact of revenge porn. ""If anything can be real, nothing is real,"" the user added. ""Even legitimate homemade sex movies used as revenge porn can be waved off as fakes as this system becomes more relevant."" These kind of justification gymnastics are of course designed to protect the mental well-being of those who create this material, rather than those who are featured in it. But the deepfake community is right about one thing: the technology is here, and there is no going back.",In recent weeks there has been an explosion in what has become known as deepfakes: pornographic videos manipulated so that the original actress's face is replaced with somebody else's.
"By Tom GerkenBBC News Players of Fifa 20 will instead have to search for ""Piemonte Calcio"" if they want to play as Juventus stars such as Cristiano Ronaldo and Aaron Ramsey. Piemonte Calcio will have its own badge and kit, designed by EA Sports. This marks the first time in 25 years that Fifa will not hold the licence for the Serie A champions. PES v Fifa It is a debate that has raged on for years. The two games have been rivals since Fifa 95 and International Superstar Soccer (PES's former name) were released in November 1994. Annual releases followed for each game, with Fifa almost always holding the licences to every major team and player, barring a few notable absences. For example, EA Sports missed out on the licence to the other Ronaldo back in Fifa 99, where he was replaced by a suspiciously similar Brazilian called A Calcio. PES historically chose not to pay for expensive licences, instead letting its gameplay speak for itself. And in PES 2019 Juventus were known as PM Black White. Whether this latest development is the first step in a new direction is unclear - but it marks the first time that PES has got one over on its rival with a major licence. Meanwhile, Fifa 20 has announced its own ""long-term"" partnership with Liverpool FC, which comes after Konami announced their contract with the Champions League winners had come to an end.","Fifa 20 will not feature Juventus, after Konami, the games company that makes Pro Evolution Soccer 2020, signed an exclusive deal with the club."
"Tyler Barriss, of Los Angeles, is alleged to have called police in Kansas falsely claiming he was armed and had taken hostages at a home in Wichita. Armed police responded and shot dead the home's unarmed resident, Andrew Finch, while investigating. Mr Barriss is thought to have made the prank call following a row between two gamers playing Call of Duty online. Jail sentence US police said the call was an act of ""swatting"", where a person makes a false report to send police to another person's home or poses as another person to send police to a fake address. Mr Barriss is alleged to have been asked by one Call of Duty player to ""swat"" the other. However, when asked for an address the gamer passed on details for Mr Finch's home, which was unconnected to either of the gamers who had fallen out. Police are reportedly still investigating the identities of the two CoD gamers believed to have been involved. Charges levelled at Mr Barriss during the hearing include involuntary manslaughter, giving a false alarm and interference with law enforcement. If convicted, Mr Barriss could face up to 11 years in jail. In an interview with a local news station in Kansas, Mr Barriss said he understood the ""magnitude"" of what had happened and felt ""remorse"". ""It hasn't just affected my life, it's affected someone's family too,"" he told the KWCH station. District Attorney Marc Bennett, in Kansas, said he was still investigating the conduct of the officer who had shot Mr Finch.",An American suspected of making a prank call that led to a fatal shooting has been charged with manslaughter.
"By Zoe KleinmanTechnology reporter, BBC News Interim chief executive Ellen Pao resigned on Friday after about 200,000 users had called for her dismissal. Ms Blount told website Recode she believed Ms Pao had been put on a ""glass cliff"" - or set up to fail. Victoria Taylor, who oversaw a popular question-and-answer section of the site, was sacked last month. ""Victoria wasn't on a glass cliff. But it's hard for me to see it any other way than Ellen was,"" Bethanye Blount said in an interview. But Ms Blount, a former Facebook employee, added that her own decision to leave Reddit just two months after joining, had not been based on gender issues. And new chief executive, Steve Huffman, said he was ""confident"" that the site could recruit female executives. The phrase ""glass cliff"" is used to describe women placed in leadership roles during times of crisis, when positive change is hard to achieve. Ms Taylor's departure threw the Reddit community into uproar, with moderators shutting down popular parts of the site in protest. And Ms Pao was widely blamed for the sacking of the popular employee. However, her predecessor, Yishan Wong, has since suggested that it had not been Ms Pao's decision after all, blaming Alexis Ohanian, Reddit co-founder and board member. ""Alexis wasn't some employee reporting to Pao, he was the executive chairman of the board, ie Pao's boss,"" he wrote. ""He had different ideas for AMAs [Ask Me Anythings], he didn't like Victoria's role, and decided to fire her. Pao wasn't able to do anything about it."" Mr Wong added that he was upset that Mr Ohanian had not defended his choice while Ms Pao had been receiving online abuse branded ""sickening"" by board member Sam Altman as a result. Writing separately on Reddit, Mr Ohanian, also known as kn0thing, appeared to confirm his role in the controversial upheaval. ""It was my decision to change how we work with AMAs, and the transition was my failure, and I hope we can keep moving forward from that lesson,"" he wrote. He added that Ellen Pao was ""a class act"". Fine finances Despite the ongoing turmoil, Reddit is in good financial shape, according to Mr Huffman, also one of its co-founders. ""Reddit has a lot of cash,"" he said, in an Ask Me Anything session on the site. ""Monetisation isn't a short-term concern of ours."" The site currently attracts 164 million monthly users. It was bought by Conde Nast in 2006 but now operates as a spin-off enterprise of the firm's parent company Advance Publications.

"The Facebook-owned business had already introduced the policy in India six months ago. The move followed a number of mob lynchings that were blamed on fake reports spread via the service. Until now, users elsewhere could forward messages up to 20 times. The update to the app's rules was announced at an event in Jakarta, Indonesia. The country is holding its general election in April. The firm told the BBC it had made its decision after ""carefully"" evaluating the results of its half-year-long test in the country. ""The forward limit significantly reduced forwarded messages around the world,"" a spokeswoman added. ""[This] will help keep WhatsApp focused on private messaging with close contacts. We'll continue to listen to user feedback about their experience, and over time, look for new ways of addressing viral content."" Scrambled messages Up to 256 users can be enrolled in a WhatsApp group. So, theoretically, a single user can now only forward a message up to 1,280 other individuals rather than the 5,120 people figure that had been possible previously. There is nothing, however, to stop those on the receiving end each forwarding the message up to five times themselves. The restriction comes at a time WhatsApp and Facebook's other services are under scrutiny for their role in the spread of propaganda and other untruths online. Last week, Facebook announced it had removed 500 pages and accounts allegedly involved in peddling fake news in Central Europe, Ukraine and other Eastern European nations. It also recently announced that it had employed a UK-fact-checking service to flag content on its main platform. However, the use of end-to-end encryption by WhatsApp means its messages can only be read by their senders and recipients, limiting the firm's ability to spot false reports. But at the end of last year, the Indian press reported that the government was considering a change to the law that would force Facebook to police WhatsApp for ""unlawful"" content. This would challenge its use of the encryption technology.",WhatsApp is limiting all its members to forwarding any single message up to five times in an effort to tackle the spread of false information on the platform.
"Dominic CascianiHome affairs correspondent@BBCDomCon Twitter The companies voluntarily assist police across the UK and Europe but face being forced to stop the work. Talks are ongoing to try and create an exemption for the tech giants. Child safety experts say if the row is unresolved the law will inadvertently make it easier for abusers. The threat to the investigations has been triggered by attempts in the European Parliament to protect private online communications from monitoring by internet companies. However, the new rules could prevent those same companies using software to automatically scan for child sexual abuse material going through their systems. The tools developed over a decade can identify: On Thursday, talks in Brussels between the European Parliament, Commission officials and representatives of the member states will attempt to agree how to exempt the internet companies from the incoming privacy law. If those talks fail, the law will ban the use of the most automated tools that sweep through million of communications, before passing leads and patterns on to law enforcement agencies. 'Further harm' John Carr, secretary of the UK Children's Charities' Coalition on Internet Safety and a globally-recognised expert in the field, warned that time was running out to ensure all of the detection work would continue. ""If Brussels does not change this law or put it on hold... sexual predators will have an easier time contacting children,"" said Mr Carr. ""There will be more videos of children being raped available for people to view or download. ""The latter not only does further harm to the children depicted in the videos, to the extent such material also encourages or sustains paedophile behaviour, it puts children as yet unharmed in danger in every country in the world."" Experts estimate that if the most controversial privacy measures become law, there could be a 70% drop in reports from internet companies to law enforcement agencies across the world. The US-based National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children received almost 17m reports from internet companies in 2019, including alerts about potential abusers and victims operating across Europe. The UK's National Crime Agency has not commented on the stand-off in Brussels - but it is part of a global group of law enforcement organisations that has lobbied Europe because it believes there is a risk to investigations and protection work. The outgoing US Attorney General William Barr is the latest to raise concerns, saying the plans in the EU risked undermining the global response to a global crime. And MEP David Lega, co-president of the European Parliament's child safety group, said the privacy measures demanded by campaigners could set back the fight against online abuse 10 years. ""The cooperation between the tech companies and the law-enforcement authorities has proven instrumental in rescuing children in the EU and globally from child sexual abuse,"" he said. ""By introducing [privacy] conditions, we will just give companies the perfect excuse to stop the voluntary use of these technologies.""","Global internet firms could be banned from automatically detecting child abuse images on their systems from as early as next Monday, amid a row over privacy laws within the European Union."
"More than 1,500 Amazon employees have pledged to stage a ""walkout"" protest against the company's environmental record, on Friday. It will be the first walkout by staff at Amazon's Seattle headquarters. Organisers have welcomed Mr Bezos's promise but say it does not go far enough. Mr Bezos said he hoped to make the company carbon neutral 10 years earlier than expected. At a press conference in Washington DC, he announced the launch of a climate pledge any company can sign up to. Its aim is to meet the targets set out in the Paris agreement by 2040, 10 years earlier than specified. Greenpeace welcomed the announcement but said Amazon needed to end its use of fossil fuels. ""If Jeff Bezos wants Amazon to be a leader on climate, he needs to spell out exactly how it is going to rapidly move the company off of fossil fuels to keep our planet within the 1.5 degree temperature threshold in the Paris Agreement that Amazon has now committed to,"" the organisation said. ""Throwing money at carbon offsets and continuing to support the oil giants find even more oil is an early indication that Jeff Bezos doesn't understand the transition that is needed."" Promises To meet its pledge, Amazon said it had ordered 100,000 electric delivery vehicles to reduce its fuel consumption. The first will enter service in 2021. As well as its online shopping and delivery operations, Amazon operates vast data centres and cloud computing services. According to the International Energy Agency, data centres were responsible for about 1% of the world's electricity use in 2018. And demand for cloud computing is expected to increase. Mr Bezos said 40% of the energy Amazon used was currently from renewable sources but this would rise to 100% by 2030. Amazon will also invest $100m (£80m) to restore forests and wetlands. The company will also measure and report greenhouse gas emissions regularly. ""We want to use our scope and our scale to lead the way,"" said Mr Bezos in a press statement. In June 2017, the Trump administration said the US would withdraw from the Paris climate accord. But Amazon said it would meet the targets set out in the agreement 10 years ""ahead of schedule"". In July, thousands of Amazon workers staged protests about pay and working conditions at the online retail giant.

"Dave LeeNorth America technology reporter The team from SparkFun Electronics was able to open a SentrySafe safe in around 30 minutes. The robot is able to reduce the number of possible combinations from one million to just 1,000, before quickly and automatically trying the remaining combinations until it breaks in. After the robot discovered the combination was 51.36.93, the safe popped open - to rapturous applause from the audience of several hundred hackers. SparkFun’s Nathan Siedle told the BBC: ""That was one of the scariest things we’ve done. Lots of things can go wrong, and this was a very big audience. ""We’re really happy it opened up.” A spokeswoman for SentrySafe could not be reached on Friday. But speaking to Wired magazine earlier this month, when the team demonstrated its method on a smaller safe, a spokeswoman for the safe maker said: ""In this environment, the product accomplished what it was designed to do. “[It] would be realistically very difficult, if not impossible, for the average person to replicate in the field.” Budget bot The latest demonstration was performed at Def Con, the largest gathering of underground hackers in the world. The SparkFun team was not able to travel with a weighty safe, and so bought a new one that was opened up for the first time on stage. The team joked the safe could have been cracked sooner - but they had to fill their 45-minute time slot. The robot, which cost around $200 to put together, makes use of 3D-printed parts that can be easily replaced to fit different brands of combination safe. It cannot crack a digital lock - although vulnerabilities in those systems have been exposed by other hacking teams in the past. Lost combination The team’s work began when Mr Siedle’s wife Alicia bought a safe on eBay that was cheap due to the previous owner not knowing what the combination was. “She gave it to me for Christmas,” Mr Siedle said. The mechanism in the safe consists of three dials which, when aligned, allow the safe to be opened. Each dial can be any two digit number - meaning one million potential combinations. But the robot doesn’t simply try every combination. It is able to suss out one of the dials within 20 seconds by detecting the size of indents on the dial. In simple terms, the “solution” indent is slightly larger than the “incorrect"" indents. In the demonstration, this method meant the team discovered the third and final number was 93. The other two dials cannot be measured - but eliminating one greatly reduces the number of possible combinations. It was made easier when the team also discovered that the safe’s design allows for a margin of error to compensate for humans getting their combination slightly wrong. For example, if one dial is set to open at 14, using 15 and 13 will work as well. It meant the robot could check every third number, making it possible to quickly test the remaining combinations much faster than a human being. Using this method, they could cut down the number of possible combinations to around 1,000 - a far more manageable challenge. Bic pen Before the attempt, Mr Siedle told the BBC the robot could be easily adapted to tackle any combination safe. “We designed it for a particular type of safe, but it doesn’t really matter - you can actually 3D-print a coupler that can match any safe that you may have.” Some SentrySafe models come with an additional lock and key, but the team was able to unlock it by using a Bic pen. “No matter how much money you spend on a safe… nothing is impervious,” Mr Siedle said. ___________ Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC You can reach Dave securely through encrypted messaging app Signal on: +1 (628) 400-7370","Using a cheap robot, a team of hackers has cracked open a leading-brand combination safe, live on stage in Las Vegas."
"By Chris FoxTechnology reporter Scruff said it had changed its profile picture rules after ""repeated suspensions by app store distributors"" but declined to specify which stores. The app was most recently suspended from Google Play in January, when it disappeared for three days. Google told BBC News it did not comment on individual apps. Several Scruff members responded to the policy change on social media, threatening to delete their accounts. ""Craigslist, Backpage, Tumblr, now even Scruff, a gay dating app you have to be of consenting age to use, is censoring how its users can post photos? This isn't looking so good guys,"" said vlogger Amp Somers, who runs the sex education YouTube channel Watts The Safeword, which has 170,000 subscribers. 'Explicit content' Scruff is a social network and dating app for gay, bisexual and trans men. Members can browse a grid of profiles and speak to people in their area, or explore other locations. However, it has disappeared from Google Play several times in recent months. In a blog post that referred to the app's temporary disappearance from Google Play in January, the company said: ""Had this removal been permanent, it would have been devastating to our company and our community."" It had now enacted ""wide-ranging changes to its profile photo content guidelines"" in order to ""ensure continued and full compliance"", the blog post added. The company also told BBC News it took content moderation seriously. Google declined to tell BBC News why Scruff had been removed from the app store several times. Part of the challenge facing Scruff and similar apps ""is the fact that different app stores publish guidelines with varying degrees of specificity"", chief executive Eric Silverberg told BBC News. Google does publish a policy for app developers regarding sexually explicit content but it is very short and subject to interpretation. While images of sex toys, sex acts and sex with animals are expressly forbidden, the policy otherwise bans only ""sexually suggestive poses"". Prior to the change, Scruff's policies already forbade: Its updated policy also bans: Last week, when the updated policy was introduced, it also banned photos of ""hugging and kissing"" but his has now been changed to ""sexually suggestive embraces"" following criticism from its members. Scruff said existing profile photos would be rechecked to ensure compliance with the new policy. Rival policies Rival dating app Grindr does not allow underwear photos but does allow swimwear ""in context"", such as photos taken on the beach. Tinder's profile guidelines do not give specific examples but do state ""no nudity, no sexually explicit content"". Both Grindr and the LGBT social network Hornet told BBC News they had not been suspended from Google Play. The fetish app Recon is not available on Google Play, although a tamer version of Recon, which filters more explicit profile images, is available on Apple's App Store. While Google declined to comment, it made clear that its moderators did not discriminate based on sexuality or gender identity. Held to account In his blog explaining the new policy, Mr Silverberg said the criticism from its members was ""not unfounded"". ""Given that Scruff is a community that speaks openly and positively about sex, bodies, and intimacy, some feel that such policies are at odds with those values,"" he wrote. ""Scruff respects the concerns voiced by our community on this matter, and we encourage everyone to continue to hold us, and all tech companies, accountable for the content and conduct standards we enforce.""","Gay dating app Scruff has banned images of men in underwear or swimming trunks, after it was suspended from the Google Play app store several times."
"All those hours spent alone, in a back room or a basement, surrounded by expensive equipment. All that time spent learning, making mistakes and improving, finding out what to do and how to do it. Who does that describe? Geeks, hackers, makers? No. Musicians. Combine them and what sweet music they make. Sometimes. At other times they use technology to make something much funnier. Take The Gregory Brothers. The four-piece plays all kinds of music when gigging but on the web have married their musical and lyrical skills with auto-tune software to make the news more interesting. In a series of videos, the various members of the Gregory Brothers sing along as auto-tuning is applied to the words of people in the news. Auto-tuning began as a useful tool for record producers to ensure the voices of their stars hit all the right notes by artificially correcting pitch. The Gregory Brothers use it in a more extreme way to turn speech into singing. The results involve President Obama singing about knowing whose ""ass to kick"" but their most famous work was the Bed Intruder Song which came out of the energetic interview Antoine Dodson gave to news programmes after an attempted attack on his sister. Guitar hero Then there are those who swap the sonic stylings of rock and pop stars for something more discordant. You might be forgiven for thinking that it would be easy to simply overdub the audio and make any one sound like they couldn't carry a tune in a paper bag. And it is. But the people perpetrating these ""shreds"" are not interested in what's easy. The key to a good shred is making it sound authentic - and that can involve a lot of time, technology and tinkering. Perth-based Tom Mitchell, aka allergonoise on YouTube, has deconstructed the works of Radiohead, Coldplay, Kings of Leon, Sigur Ros and many others. Why those particular bands? ""It's usually nothing to do with my personal taste,"" he said ""I find I pick the bands that maybe take themselves a bit more seriously than others."" Explaining how he got started, he said: ""My flatmate showed me a couple of the original shreds of Eric Clapton and others, and I thought it was one of the funniest things I'd ever seen."" ""I was really impressed and amazed by them,"" he said. At the time he was studying audio production and had been playing the guitar for over a decade. Watching those original shreds, he remembers thinking: ""I might be able to do that."" At first it was a joint effort with his flatmate and friends and those first few shreds were put together using Apple's Garage Band program. Soon it turned into a solo project and his shreds became more intricate. ""I try to use a microphone that's like their microphone,"" he said, ""and pretend I'm the sound guy at that gig and how I would make it sound like that. I listen for the acoustics at that venue, for every single element that makes that sound."" Poor shreds lack that reality, he said, adding that they sound too ""roomy"" - by which he means they sound like they are being recorded in someone's back room rather than a sweaty club, cavernous concert hall or open-air stadium. The music Mr Mitchell swaps for the original also cannot be any old strumming or plucking. What you hear, he said, has to match what you see. ""I watch the video clip a few times and learn how to play the song properly,"" he said, ""and then just do something to put me off like play it upside down but while I'm doing so I'll listen to the original song. ""I know what I'm doing but I don't play it right,"" he said. The results are eerily authentic. A successful shred is one in which the listener genuinely wonders if what they are hearing is real. For the dedicated shreds-maker an e-mail asking if it is fake, or from someone who says they were at that gig and do not remember it sounding like that is as good as a round of applause. Practice run In that sense Santeri Ojala, aka StSanders on YouTube, is a master of the art of the shred. Watch his deconstructions of The Beatles, Queen, The Rolling Stones and Kiss and it becomes hard to remember the lyrics of the original so closely are the nonsense words matched to the lip and mouth movements of Lennon, Mercury, Jagger and Simmons. ""The first one was really hard to do,"" said Mr Ojala, ""I spent most of the summer just rewinding the video to get it right."" Mr Ojala was prompted to shred by a video of guitar legend Steve Vai. ""I was watching a video of him without sound and I noticed how goofy he looked,"" he said. ""I just decided to make it even more goofy."" For Mr Ojala a shred must do more than make people laugh. It must also offer something to those who know their way around a guitar. This means, he said, that the bum notes and crashed chords he swaps for the real notes must be authentic and resemble the kinds of mistakes everyone makes when learning to play. ""I think that's why they like it,"" he said, ""because they know that part is hard to play."" Although Mr Ojala is very well known on YouTube for his shreds, it will remain, he said, a hobby until he can make it pay. Also, he said, finding good targets is tricky. Though he has an inkling about who might be next. Justin Bieber. ""It'll be a hard one because I genuinely think I could not do worse,"" he said. ""It's going to need something different from me. I might attempt to make him look really cool.""","In our regular series talking to makers and hackers, Tech Know visits and talks to some of those who marry technical knowledge with musical virtuosity."

Samsung recalls smartphone after fires Samsung takes over maker of Apple's Siri A Southwest Airlines spokesperson told the BBC: ""A customer reported smoke emitting from an electronic device. All customers and crew deplaned safely via the main cabin door."" The owner of the phone, speaking to Jordan Golson from The Verge, said it was bought on 21 September. Brian Green added that there was a black square icon on the device's packaging, a symbol which Samsung added to distinguish old, certified unsafe devices from the replacement models. But late last month, after assuring customers - and safety officials - that the fixed devices were safe, Samsung confirmed it was looking into new reports that devices were still overheating. ""There have been a few reports about the battery charging levels and we would like to reassure everyone that the issue does not pose a safety concern,"" the South Korean firm said at the time. Mr Green said his device was powered down, not charging, when it began to overheat in his pocket. After tossing it on to the floor of the plane, it started to emit a ""thick grey-green angry smoke"", according to The Verge. The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) had issued a warning to the public saying Note 7 devices should be powered down and not charged while on planes. It also advised against packing the phone into hold luggage. The FAA is yet to comment on whether further guidelines will be issued after this latest issue.

"One in ten said their child was using an internet capable smartphone, such as the iPhone or Android devices. The research by cloud security firm Westcoastcloud questioned 2,000 families about their technology ownership. It comes as the government considers mandatory content filters for net connections used by children. In those households surveyed, 16% of children owned their own laptop, while 18% had a flat-screen TV in their bedroom. A quarter of those aged ten or under had an email address while 8% had a social networking account. Most parents agreed that 10 was a suitable age for children to have their own phone with the majority (69%) saying they bought one to keep in touch with their offspring when they are out. A quarter of children owned a Nintendo Wii, and around 16% had a digital music player. Parents appeared to have mixed attitudes to how much they monitored what their children did online. More (21%) said they didn't follow their child on a social network than those that did (13%). By contrast, only 12% said they left children to 'play' unmonitored when using a laptop or computer. There was also an even spilt when it came to using parental controls with just under half (49%) saying they blocked access to certain sites while the remainder admitted they had no controls. For Will Gardner of children's charity Childnet, the findings reiterate the need for parents to understand how their children are using technology. ""It is important to help ensure parents are aware of the full functionality of the technology that young children are accessing and that they are able to use the tools and give the support that young people need to stay safe and get the most out of these devices,"" he said. The Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (CEOP) has set up a website - thinkuknow - in order to offer advice and guidance on how youngsters use technology. ""We know that technology, especially mobile phones, are now part of parcel of childrens' everyday lives. They allow the internet to be at the fingertips of young people, which means it is now increasingly difficult for parents to manage their child's use of it,"" said a CEOP spokesperson. The government is currently considering the recommendations of the Bailey Review which calls for internet service providers to automatically offer parents software that will filter out harmful content. The measures could be included in the revised Communications Act, due by 2015.","Nearly a third of children aged ten or under now have their own mobile phone, according to survey of parents."
"By Maggie ShielsTechnology reporter, BBC News, Silicon Valley Places, as it is known, marks the company's first foray into the ""location-based services"" space, which has become popular with users who want to share where they shop, eat or play. Sites such as Foursquare and Gowalla already offer similar features. Places will initially only be available in the US through Facebook's iPhone app or by logging onto its smartphone site. The company plans to extend the feature to all its 500 million members as soon as it can. ""This is meaningful because you can stay connected with your friends around you,"" said company founder Mark Zuckerberg. Third place The product, which uses the GPS on smartphones, works by getting users to tap a ""check-in"" button to see a list of places near where they are. From there they can choose the place that matches their location and ""create a story"" in their friends' News Feeds on the site. Users can also let people know who they are with by ""tagging"" any Facebook friends, but only as long as they check-in to the location as well. The company's vice president of product Chris Cox said that while home and work are two of the most important places in people's lives, Places tries to tap into the third most important. ""This third place is the one we end up talking about a lot. I went to a movie, I saw a band, I went to a bar. So much of the interesting stuff in our lives happens in this small amount of time and we want to make that come alive,"" Mr Cox told BBC News. ""The worst portrait of Facebook is people at home just looking at pictures of other people having fun. This is exactly the opposite. This is a very participatory, real-world kind of thing."" Mobile explosion Location based services have been growing in popularity among users with smartphones. One of the most talked about is Foursquare, which now has more than three million users. It plays up the game aspect of checking in with friends by awarding points and virtual badges. Far from being viewed as a threat to its future, Foursquare's vice president of mobile and partnerships Holger Leudorf said he sees Facebook's entry into this arena as an opportunity. ""This will certainly put the spotlight on the check-in industry even more but I don't think it represents Facebook stealing our thunder,"" he said. ""You see elements here that you see on Foursquare but this is more about validating that we are onto something and that this will be a much, much bigger thing going forward."" Other companies building on top of the Facebook platform alongside Foursquare include Gowalla, Booyah, Loopt and the business review site Yelp. While the location-based sector is still nascent it is predicted to become a billion dollar market when it comes to targeting advertising or promotions at people based on their proximity to a business. Media research firm Borrell Associates has estimated that such services could generate as much as $4.1 billion (£2.6 billion) in annual ad sales by 2015. This is in part because of the explosion of people using Facebook and other services on their mobile phones. Facebook estimates that more than 150 million of its members access the site via a mobile. ""We have gone from a world where online we know who I am, what I am doing and when to where I am doing it,"" said Susan Etlinger, analyst with the Altimeter Group. ""This changes the game dramatically. And knowing what my friends think of a bar or a restaurant has a much bigger value to me than 40 to 100 strangers because my friend's experiences matter more to me. ""And If I am a business, it gives me a channel to engage with my customers at a point they are most likely to purchase,"" Ms Etlinger told the BBC. Privacy concerns Clearly stung by previous criticism over the way the company has handled users' privacy in the past, Facebook has taken a different tack this time. The networking site has given users controls over what and how much information they share on the service. Facebook said Places is about ""broadcasting to your friends, not the whole world"". Users can remove themselves if someone tags them. They can also disable the feature if they are not interested. ""They have been pretty thoughtful about the privacy stuff here, but they had to be given the backlash in the recent past,"" said analyst Greg Sterling of Sterling Market Intelligence. ""They have ensured that the default setting is about the individual and not the world and that is the biggest shift from a privacy standpoint.""",Social networking behemoth Facebook has added a feature that allows members to share where they are while on the move.
"By Chris FoxTechnology reporter Platforms may also have to seek out similar examples of the illegal content and remove them, instead of waiting for each to be reported. One expert said it was a significant ruling with global implications. Facebook said the judgement raised ""critical questions around freedom of expression"". What was the case about? The case stemmed from an insulting comment posted on Facebook about Austrian politician Eva Glawischnig-Piesczek, which the country's courts said damaged her reputation. Under EU law, Facebook and other platforms are not held responsible for illegal content posted by users, until they have been made aware of it - at which point, they must remove it quickly. But it was unclear whether an EU directive, saying platforms cannot be made to monitor all posts or actively seek out illegal activity, could be overridden by a court order. Austria's Supreme Court asked Europe's highest court to clarify this. Thursday's ruling says three things: Facebook is unable to appeal against this ruling. What does this mean in practice? ""If there's a court order to say that someone's been defamed, then Facebook has to also search for different variations of it,"" Prof Steve Peers, from the University of Essex, told BBC News. Privacy campaigner Max Schrems added that the ruling could have implications for Facebook's closed groups. In the past, the social network had required users to identify each instance of a post they wanted to be taken down before the firm would tackle them. But since some of its pages are members-only, the victim might not be able to access them all. Now, the onus would be on Facebook to find them, Mr Schrems suggested. Facebook has said countries would have to ""set out very clear definitions on what 'identical' and 'equivalent' means in practice"". It said the ruling ""undermines the long-standing principle that one country does not have the right to impose its laws on speech on another country"". However, platforms can be compelled to take down posts worldwide within the framework of relevant international laws only. ""There's no harmonised defamation law internationally,"" said Prof Peers. ""Facebook might say we can't do this to the United States, because even though it infringes Austrian law, it doesn't infringe US law.""",Facebook and similar apps and websites can be ordered to take down illegal posts worldwide after a landmark ruling from the EU's highest court.
"Usually, smartphone hacks rely on user error - by clicking on a suspicious link, opening a message or downloading a malicious app - to gain control. But Google Project Zero researcher Ian Beer has revealed how attackers could steal emails, photos, messages - and even access the camera and microphone. Apple fixed the issue in May. And all up-to-date devices are secure. Download photos The hack was possible because Apple's devices use a technology called Apple Wireless Direct Link. This uses wi-fi to allow users to send files and photos over Apple's AirDrop technology and easily share screens with other iOS devices. Mr Beer exploited this network to show how hackers could gain access to a device from a distance. In a blog post, he explained how he was able to complete the hack, which he spent six months investigating. 'Rich pickings' He found no evidence the vulnerability had been ""exploited in the wild"", although said some people tweeted when the bug was fixed in May. ""As we all pour more and more of our souls into these devices, an attacker can gain a treasure trove of information on an unsuspecting target,"" he said. Apple has not yet responded to a BBC News request for comment. Prof Daniel Dresner, cyber security expert at the University of Manchester, said the lack of known exploitation was reassuring, as was the quick reactions of those involved in detection and remediation. ""It's significant given how new services could be exploited, as devices become more connected,"" he said. ""As phones seem to be the pivot point of always-on online living, they are rich pickings for finding these vulnerabilities to exploit."" ""This showed you didn't have to be very close at all to the phone to hack it,"" Prof Alan Woodward, from the University of Surrey, said. ""It's a very simple hack. You don't even really have to understand what's going on inside the device to be able to remove a considerable amount of data from it."" Location data Last year, Mr Beer revealed a ""sustained effort"" to hack iPhones, using booby-trapped websites, said to have been visited thousands of times per week. Once on an iPhone, the implant could access an enormous amount of data, including (though not limited to) contacts, images and global-positioning-system (GPS) location data, and relay it to an external server every 60 seconds. In response, Apple accused Google of fear-mongering, as the investigation had been published six months after it had fixed the issues. However, it is common practice for responsible security researchers not to publish their findings until after a company has been given the chance to fix a flaw. Another Apple flaw was also revealed in March by mobile security company ZecOps. Their research said a bug in the Mail app had made devices susceptible to sophisticated attacks. At the time, an Apple representative told Reuters news agency a fix would be included in upcoming software updates. Google's Android devices have also previously had vulnerabilities revealed. Watchdog Which? suggested more than a billion Android devices were at risk of being hacked because they were no longer protected by security updates. Anyone using an Android phone released in 2012 or earlier should be especially concerned, it said.",Researchers have revealed a flaw that allowed Apple iPhones to be hacked from afar without the owner doing anything.
"By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor Woz - as he's commonly known - acted as a consultant to Danny Boyle's film after refusing to be involved in an earlier biopic. The movie is already being tipped for awards glory after a rough cut was shown to the public last weekend, ahead of its official premiere in October. The movie's scriptwriter is Aaron Sorkin. His previous account of Facebook's rise won three Oscars. But the social network's founder Mark Zuckerberg was not a fan. Some wondered what Woz would make of the new film after he expressed mixed feelings about the way its trailer showed him angrily challenging Steve Jobs to his face. But, as he told the BBC, he is more than satisfied with the outcome. You've now had a chance to watch the rough cut of the film. What were your impressions of it? I've actually seen two rough cuts. My impression was I was shocked and amazed at how good it was in the sense of professional filmmaking. I usually go to a movie not looking for ""do I like the story"" as much as: ""What is the quality that came out of the heads of the people that made it?"" In this case the filmmakers have done an award-winning job. The acting was just so realistic. In some prior movies, I saw [the actors] simulating Steve Jobs, but they didn't really make me feel like I was in his head understanding what was going on inside of him - his personality. This movie absolutely accomplishes that, and it's due to great acting, which obviously comes from great directing. Some people had been critical that Michael Fassbender doesn't look like Steve Jobs. What did he manage to do, then, to capture him? A lot of people think the face of Steve Jobs matters, but it's his brain, his head, the way he worked, how did he think, how did he act with people - that's important. Michael does an incredible job with a tight script and for very much of it he's interfacing with Kate [Winslet, who plays Apple's marketing chief Joanna Hoffman], and the two of them are superb together. It's believable that this is how things would have happened and went down, and I felt I was seeing the real Steve Jobs in there. Of course, I have prosopagnosia where I don't really store faces. So, to me faces don't matter that much anyway. What particular aspects of Steve Jobs' personality are shown well? It deals with what we are all very familiar with - a lot of his negativism. This comes about less with him doing negative things to other people, and more him just sort of standing [there] and not caring as much about others as himself, and not being able to have feelings very much. It deals very much with that part of him all through the movie right to the end, with some resolution to it. That's the major conflict in the movie. But it also deals with him going through various product introductions and how he would have to be very tightly in control. Part of the ""reality distortion field"" is in there, and his failing to listen to others on occasion and only seeing everything he did as right. These are well-known traits and there are stories we've heard about Steve Jobs. But when you see it portrayed dramatically, not the way it really happened but in a way that is emotionally graphic, it really conveys what Steve Jobs was really like inside... and what it was like to be around him. How involved were you in making the film? About a year-and-a-half ago I went down and met with Aaron Sorkin. He would ask some questions and I would start relating bits and pieces of stories. And he would put them into his movie. He didn't put them in what I consider necessarily accurate or fair ways in every case, but it still came out as a good movie. Things that were in existence in the real world were put into my mouth. So, I may not have said those things. I may not have been talking to Steve at those events. But they were ""in the air"", so you have to put them in someone's mouth to make a movie. You have previously said you didn't talk to Walter Isaacson, who wrote the biography on which the movie is based. What made you decide to get involved this time round? Walter Isaacson said I did meet him at a couple of events - see I don't pay attention to names, I'll talk to anybody - and I guess I did give him information. I did not get involved in the movie Jobs that starred Ashton Kutcher. I was interested in doing consulting for it, and then they sent me a script and I thought: ""You've already got a script written and it's really lousy."" My feeling is that it just didn't represent things well at all. But I went to the movie thinking maybe it would be good. And I felt like I'd eaten a big full meal but was still hungry. Ashton Kutcher did a great job of looking like and personifying Steve Jobs on the outside but the script didn't get me to the inside. This [new] movie was just night and day the opposite of that. You earlier expressed concerns about a scene in the trailer in which Seth Rogen depicts you. How well do you think he did with the part now you've seen the whole film? I thought he did an excellent job. In many places in the movie I'm portrayed saying things that are negative directly to Steve Jobs. Anybody who knows me will tell you I just don't say negative things to people, and could not have said them, and didn't. However, there were real issues going on in the company, the world, the customers, the board, whatever. There's a tendency to mythologise successful people after their deaths. To what degree have we seen that with Jobs? Oh my gosh, even while Steve was alive [so was] the myth. He became our hero because we have our iPhones, and he saw the way the world was going to evolve much earlier than others, so we love him. But the mythology, even while he was alive, was extended back to make him that person from day one. [People] try and make him a lot more right about things than he was and ignore what some of the real facts were. The most incredible scene in the Sorkin movie is between Steve Jobs and [ex-Apple chief executive] John Sculley. It goes back and forth at two points in time [with them] saying different things that add up to where the company stood and the difference between the two of them. And it was really just a business difference. See, the mythology is that Steve Jobs had this beautiful vision for the Macintosh and the board and John Sculley didn't buy into it. No. Our entire company bought into that vision as the future for Apple. It was just going to take at least three years to build until it could finally not lose money. And John Sculley is the one who actually made the Macintosh successful because of believing in it. There's another film out - the documentary Steve Jobs: Man in the Machine - which a lot of reviewers suggest is particularly critical of Jobs. Its maker Alex Gibney has suggested that Steve Jobs' personality didn't change as he aged so much as he learned better how to control his public image. Apple's software chief Eddy Cue has described the film as being ""inaccurate and mean-spirited"". What do you make of the tension between those two views? I have not seen the film, but know it has a lot of first-hand interviews with people who were very close and around Steve during things like the early Macintosh and Next days. And a bunch of them on Facebook have told me they were there around Steve, and they've seen the movie and it exactly represents the way he was. And you know what? Eddy Cue wasn't around in those early days. Steve Jobs always dealt very nicely and respectfully with me - we were friends to the end - and I never saw a lot of the bad behaviour that he was accused of by others. But I've heard about it from others. Eddy Cue by being smart and good at what he does, Steve would have worked with him in a very different way [to his] ""You can't have your ideas, I'm going to cut you down"" [behaviour]. I don't think he had arguments with Eddy Cue or Tim Cook. He got along with people he respected highly. Even engineers who stood up to him, if they had a basis for standing up, Steve showed them respect. But I don't think Steve was never that way. To what degree do you think Apple wants to protect Jobs' reputation? I think Apple goes out of its way to try to enhance his reputation and safeguard the ""great"" Steve Jobs. Steve was not a nice ""people person"". I meet a lot of CEOs who are, and they don't have these kind of reputations and stories about their background. Think about this: What would Steve Jobs' legacy be had he been nice to everyone and still have sold great products, which is totally possible? He would just be the hero of all time. But his personality settled in around aged 18 to 23 and it stayed for life. It really almost never changed. So, his way of acting that way and not caring what other people thought about him - which lets you be nastier than you would have been otherwise - that was right there at the start of Apple. All of a sudden we had a bunch of money, Steve saw the chance to have power - which he always wanted in his life - and he ensured he was always involved in the power even though he hadn't really ever created the product or had a [prior] executive job to qualify him for the title. He established himself by force to be the leader, that was his goal. That was when his personality changed from being the nice prank-playing joking person that we'd go to concerts with, to all of a sudden everything had to be super-serious and super-business and you couldn't fall behind anyone else. I saw that change, I was there during those days, and from then on Steve wasn't the person he'd been before we had started Apple. But I would point this out: he ended up with a wife and a family and a home. He spent a lot of time there and had good relationships with his family. So, he did manage to have a side of his life that kind of didn't matter so much [to him] when he was younger and starting to get rich.",Apple's co-founder Steve Wozniak has given his first in-depth interview about the forthcoming Steve Jobs movie.
"That is double the number it received for the whole of 2012 and a sign that publishers are stepping up their battle against internet piracy. Copyright holders send millions of ""takedown"" requests to Google every week in an attempt to make pirated material harder to access online. But critics say the approach is wrong. ""As soon as you take down one page another pops up in its place,"" says Mark Mulligan, a technology analyst at Midia Consulting. ""It's like playing Whac-A-Mole."" ""This is because file sharing has become very decentralised - there's no central server you can just shut down."" Ernesto van der Sar, editor of Torrentfreak.com, a news site about file sharing, says: ""This increase in requests is more about publishers putting pressure on Google to do more to tackle piracy. If people want to pirate they can always find a way to do so."" Copyright infringement Many of the takedown requests made under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and other national copyright laws are generated by third parties, or reporting organisations, on behalf of copyright holders. Google began publishing all such requests in its Transparency Report in 2012 and since then the number has risen sharply, as rights holders have made greater use of the reporting system. In the past month alone Google received requests to take down nearly 14 million links from its search results, relating to 3,200 copyright owners. One digital content protection specialist, Degban, makes requests for about 300,000 link removals per week on behalf of clients and has asked for nearly 31 million web pages, or URLs, to be removed from Google's results so far, reports the search firm. The website domains concerned are almost entirely person-to-person file-sharing services, such as Fenopy.eu, extratorrent.com, torrenthound.com, filestube.com and bittorrent.com. More than half of Degban's URL requests were made on behalf of Froytal Services, a pornography producer, giving an indication of the kind of content people are sharing online. But other major copyright owners making the most takedown requests included the BPI (British Recorded Music Industry) and its member companies, the Recording Industry Association of America, and various film studios, such as Warner Brothers. A spokesperson for the BPI told the BBC: ""BPI removes around one million links every week to music hosted on the internet without the artist's knowledge or permission. ""This process is one of many initiatives undertaken by the industry to help to create breathing space for more than 70 legal music services in the UK that strive to promote and reward musicians."" Mistakes There are concerns that some of these takedown requests may not be accurate. For example, Microsoft recently asked by mistake for links to its own sites to be deleted. The embarrassing request was made on Microsoft's behalf by LeakID, an anti-piracy specialist, according to Torrentfreak.com. Google spotted the mistake and did not delete the links, but confirmed to the BBC that almost all takedown requests it receives are acted upon. ""Mistakes are made as most of this activity is automated"", says Mr Van Der Sar, ""but Google is pretty good at filtering them out."" Neither Microsoft nor LeakID would comment on the mistake. Internet piracy Last week, a UK court ordered British internet service providers to block access to EZTV and YIFY Torrents after they were found to be conducting internet piracy on a ""mass scale"". The action was brought by the Federation Against Copyright Theft (Fact) and the Motion Picture Association (MPA). A growing number of sites accused of aiding piracy are now blocked to UK web users, including the Pirate Bay, Kickass Torrents, H33T, Fenopy, Movie2K and Download4All. In addition, the Premier League has won a block on football streaming site FirstRow1.eu.",Google has received requests to remove more than 100 million links since January 2013 for web pages deemed to be in breach of copyright laws.
"By Mark WardTechnology correspondent, BBC News Anyone who has spent time playing World of Warcraft knows the game is all about the gear. Complete any quest and you will be rewarded with loot (money or items) from the monsters you kill or from whichever denizen of Azeroth gave you the task. The gear a character wears has a big influence on how powerful they are, new sets are regularly released by the game's creators and some items require hours of playing for a gamer to have a small glimmering shard of a chance to pick them up. As a result many players would prefer being swallowed by the dragon Onyxia than suffer the social death of being seen in last season's armour. No wonder then that the auction house is one of the busiest places in WoW. For some online gamers, as well as those who adore anime, that love of gear and being in character does not stop when they set down the mouse or remote. Increasing numbers are taking up their glue guns, wire cutters and sewing needles to fashion costumes so they can dress up like their favourite game or cartoon character. Sophie Pickford has created many different costumes drawn from the worlds of anime and video games including Aphrodite IX, The Joker and Rorschach. But her most ambitious creation was her plan to look like a blue-skinned Draenei druid she plays in WoW. ""It was quite a natural progression,"" she said ""I'm always drawing, illustrating and I've got my own web comic that was influenced by World of Warcraft."" Having spent a lot of time thinking and working on 2D designs, Ms Pickford decided to go from the virtual to the real. ""I thought it would be fun to try one design on myself,"" she said. Having chosen the Draenei she had one big hurdle to overcome - how to fashion the hooves they have instead of feet. As with many other makers, Ms Pickford was inspired by what she saw online. ""I saw a tutorial about how to make hooves and thought 'If they did it then I could easily do that myself',"" she said. She has returned the favour by recording her own three-part video series of how she turned a cheap pair of high-heels into convincing-looking hooves. All it took was time, chicken wire, papier-mache, plaster and a file. Getting into so-called costume play also led Hazel Cogan, aka Silantre, to develop new skills. In her case it was sword-making because she decided to fashion a costume of key Warcraft character Arthas (aka the Lich King) as a birthday present for her sister. Key to the costume is the runeblade Frostmourne and it took Ms Cogan three attempts to get it right. ""I've never made a sword before,"" said Ms Cogan. ""The handle was not holding the weight of the blade so I had to put nuts and bolts in to fix it."" Although Ms Cogan learned a great deal while fashioning her own-brand Arthas she has learned more putting together a costume of a night elf druid. In particular, she has become very skilful at using a soldering iron to put intricate and detailed designs on the suede which forms the costume. The hood of the costume is made from 260 separate scales of material. Trickiest of all to emulate were the glowing blue eyes that are common among night elves. ""The torches for the eyes were really hard to find,"" she said. ""Most were too big to make it look like my eyes were floating or not bright enough to shine through the veil or show up after a camera flash."" Ms Cogan eventually did find some torches small enough and attached them to a baseball cap with the peak cut off to ensure they would stay in place. A stroke of inspiration prompted her to use the inside of a KitKat wrapper as a reflector. The result is a spot-on recreation of those glowing blue eyes that look decidedly uncanny when combined with the hood. The attraction of cosplay does not just lie in the creation of the costume. The other pleasure is in dressing up and pretending to be someone else for a while. However, there are some perils involved in putting flesh on the digital bones of game and comic characters. Ms Cogan, for instance, has suffered for her art and sports scars from glue guns and soldering irons she picked up while crafting her many costumes. Similarly, Ms Pickford has often had a rough time dressing up as a Draenei. ""The shoes I picked to modify were not particularly comfortable in the first place,"" she said. ""Once I had worn them for a few hours then my feet were destroyed."" The other problem is the attention that being in costume brings when she attends comic conventions or cosplay expos, said Ms Pickford. When dressed as a Draenei she often gets her tail pulled. ""They do not do it out of spite but they do not realise how delicate they can be,"" she said, adding that any costume has to be stress-tested before it is worn to a convention. ""You have to make sure it does not break at the last minute,"" she said. ""I've got a friend who had made a massive amount of armour for an anime character and it broke as soon as he got to the convention."" And there lies the attraction of creating and wearing costumes. They are, said Ms Cogan, never finished but in a permanent state of refinement. The same is true for Ms Pickford. She wants to re-do the Draenei costume and do it better and not just for the sake of her feet. ""I think I can do better because you always learn a lot from your first mistakes,"" she said.","In our regular look at hackers, makers and crafters Tech Know visits people who make costumes of video and game characters."
"By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter Data centres run the equipment that processes the data consumed by internet users, and it takes a lot of energy to keep their servers cool. Some of the newer ones are now being built in colder climates. But some estimates suggest they are now responsible for 2% of global greenhouse-gas emissions. ""Being able to put a dent in that benefits the world in general,"" said DeepMind co-founder Mustafa Suleyman. Fed vast swathes of historical data collected by sensors measuring temperature and power, DeepMind's general purpose algorithm - similar to the one trained to play Atari games - had come up with a real-time, adaptive system that had cut the cost of cooling by 40% and the overall energy consumption by 15%, Mr Suleyman said. ""This will have a significant environmental impact,"" he said. The system will be rolled out across all of Google's data centres by the end of the year. And, in six weeks, DeepMind will share the details of the system in a White Paper. ""We are already talking to non-Google partners about using the same algorithm,"" Mr Suleyman said, adding it could work equally well in large manufacturing facilities and even national energy grids.

Apple has not said whether the decision to ban it was in response to a request from the Chinese authorities. The matter was brought to the wider public's attention by the Register news site. Tensions in Hong Kong have risen in recent weeks, with one protester shot by local police this week in his chest.

In a tweet in response to the decision, the app's developers said they believed it was a bureaucratic error rather than censorship. ""Everything can be used for illegal purpose on the wrong hand.

"By Zoe KleinmanTechnology reporter Travel restrictions are due to ease on 17 May, after which foreign travel can resume. However a government source told the BBC the app would not be ready ""imminently"". It is connected to GP services in England and linked to personal health data. People can use the NHS app to request repeat prescriptions, message their doctor and organise online consultations. It is completely separate from the NHS Covid-19 app, which is used for contact-tracing. The NHS app is already able to display vaccine statuses, including Covid-19 jabs - but this must be enabled by GPs, and while some seem to do this by default, other surgeries ask patients to request it. Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi told BBC Breakfast that work was under way on preparing it to act as a passport - this could involve it having access to not only vaccine status, but also to most recent test results. ""NHSx [the NHS's digital division]...are working on making that operationally possible for the 17th of May,"" he said. But in a statement, the Department of Health and Social Care said only that the app was ""being considered as part of the digital route"". It might seem that the NHS app, used by a million or so people since 2019 to book GP appointments or order prescriptions, has fortuitously given the government an instant solution to creating a vaccine passport. Not so fast - there are a number of hurdles to be cleared. While the app can record your vaccinations, that isn't automatic - I've searched in vain to find the record of my Covid jab, only to get a message saying I need to ask my GP for access to my detailed health record. If the NHS app does become a vaccine passport, millions of people will be bombarding GPs with similar requests. But the government has made it clear it wants a broader process of Covid certification, including recent test results, otherwise young people who hadn't been vaccinated wouldn't be able to travel. Integrating tests into the app promises to be complex. Finally, there's the process of transforming the NHS app into something that will be easy to use and trusted by border police around the world. ""If people think they'll just be able to flash the existing app with their vaccine record at passport control, that isn't going to happen,"" one insider told me. Getting everything ready by 17 May looks like a major bureaucratic challenge, even if the technology can be updated quickly and efficiently. A number of countries and organisations have proposed their own vaccine passport arrangements: In the UK, government minister Michael Gove provided a written statement to parliament today, following a trip to Israel to learn about the country's Green Pass system. He emphasised that there were no plans to make vaccine certification compulsory in certain domestic settings, including essential public services and shops, and on public transport, but did not focus on international travel",Transport secretary Grant Shapps appeared to confirm in a recent interview that England's NHS app would be used as a vaccine passport.
"By Chris BaraniukTechnology reporter According to three separate analyses, a flood of automated comments to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) was detected over the weekend. More than 400,000 comments with remarkably similar wording have been detected in recent days. Net neutrality proponents argue that all internet traffic should be equal. This means that no content provider should be able to, for example, charge more for faster access to certain data. One expert described bot activity as a new form of protest. ""Someone has gone out of their way to make these seem like real submissions,"" wrote Chris Sinchok in a blog post about the apparently automated activity. Having downloaded the comments and associated data, Mr Sinchok noticed that the names and email addresses associated with thousands of them also turned up in lists of personal data stolen from websites. Using 'breached data' He told the BBC that this suggested someone might be using information collected from breached databases to make the submissions look more authentic. ""It really seems like this is getting pooled from some place in an automated fashion and it's coming in at unreasonable rates,"" he said. He added that the uniformity of the data was also a possible giveaway. For example, many comments are essentially identical save for the occasional, small difference - such as the exact same sentence appearing in multiple comments, but with different letters capitalised each time. And the rate at which comments were posted also seemed suspicious, starting and stopping in bursts, he added. Other watchers, including a graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and another at Harvard University, have also tracked a boom in apparently automated activity directed at the site in recent days. Earlier this month, the FCC said it had been targeted by a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack that led to downtime for the comments system. This followed a television appearance by comedian John Oliver in which he urged people to post comments against the proposals on the FCC's website. ""Net neutrality is such a hot-button issue and it's one of the few examples of online activism that's actually amounted to something,"" noted Prof Phil Howard at the Oxford Internet Institute. He cited the 2014 online protests, after which President Obama stepped in to recommend that the FCC drop earlier proposals to curtail net neutrality. ""This is how people protest these days,"" said Prof Howard, referring to the apparently automated comments. He also pointed out that a growing number of people had the necessary programming skills to do it. However, Mr Sinchok is concerned that the bot activity will create the impression that genuine opposition to the FCC's current proposals does not really exist. ""There are people that care about this issue a lot,"" he told the BBC. ""Activity like this is really muddying the waters - and I don't want it to give [the FCC] an excuse to say, 'Hey, there's mixed support for this.'"" The FCC has not yet responded to a BBC request for comment.","Bots appear to be spamming a US regulator's website over a proposed reversal of net neutrality rules, researchers have said."
"The publisher said the seven-year-old title had 10.2 million members at the end of March - the same as at the turn of the year.

The announcements were made following the release of the publisher's first-quarter earnings. Panda pets Its net income for the three months was $384m (£234m), a 24% drop on the previous year.

However, it noted that revenue of $1.2bn for the period was better than expected and raised its forecasts due to what it described as a ""highly innovative product line"". This includes the forthcoming WoW Mists of Pandaria expansion pack, which introduces a new continent populated by martial-arts-skilled pandas and their pets. ""We expect to see increased engagement with the launch,"" said Michael Morhaime, chief executive of the firm's Blizzard division. The release should help WoW compete with its newer big-budget rival, Star Wars: The Old Republic, which lost about a quarter of its subscribers between February and April. Both titles face challenges from MMORPGs (massively multiplayer online role-playing games) Guild Wars 2 and Elder Scrolls Online. Cash for equipment The company also highlighted next week's launch of Diablo 3. Activision said that the horror-themed role-playing game had already set a new pre-order record for its Blizzard unit. The sequel features an auction house in which users can trade objects with other players using real-world currency. Activision can take a cut of each sale, potentially creating a significant new revenue stream. The company also said it had high hopes for November's release of Call of Duty: Black Ops 2, as well as a Call of Duty ""micro-transaction game for China"", for which details remain scant. It added that it thought a ""new universe"" from developer Bungie - creator of the Halo series - could also become a ""potential mega-franchise"", but did not give any further details.",Activision Blizzard says the number of subscribers to its World of Warcraft online video game has stabilised.
"By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter Thanks, in part, to a new era of machine learning, computer are already starting to assimilate information from raw data in the same way as the human infant learns from the world around her. It means we are getting machines that can, for example, teach themselves how to play computer games and get incredibly good at them (work ongoing at Google's DeepMind) and devices that can start to communicate in human-like speech, such as voice assistants on smartphones. Computers are beginning to understand the world outside of bits and bytes. Fei-Fei Li has spent the last 15 years teaching computers how to see. First as a PhD student and latterly as director of the computer vision lab at Stanford University, she has pursued the painstakingly difficult goal with an aim of ultimately creating the electronic eyes for robots and machines to see and, more importantly, understand their environment. Half of all human brainpower goes into visual processing even though it is something we all do without apparent effort. ""No one tells a child how to see, especially in the early years. They learn this through real-world experiences and examples,"" said Ms Li in a talk at the 2015 Technology, Entertainment and Design (Ted) conference. ""If you consider a child's eyes as a pair of biological cameras, they take one picture about every 200 milliseconds, the average time an eye movement is made. So by age three, a child would have seen hundreds of millions of pictures of the real world. That's a lot of training examples,"" she added. She decided to teach computers in a similar way. ""Instead of focusing solely on better and better algorithms, my insight was to give the algorithms the kind of training data that a child is given through experiences in both quantity and quality."" Back in 2007, Ms Li and a colleague set about the mammoth task of sorting and labelling a billion diverse and random images from the internet to offer examples of the real world for the computer - the theory being that if the machine saw enough pictures of something, a cat for example, it would be able to recognise it in real life. They used crowdsourcing platforms such as Amazon's Mechanical Turk, calling on 50,000 workers from 167 countries to help label millions of random images of cats, planes and people. Eventually they built ImageNet - a database of 15 million images across 22,000 classes of objects organised by everyday English words. It has become an invaluable resource used across the world by research scientists attempting to give computers vision. Each year Stanford runs a competition, inviting the likes of Google, Microsoft and Chinese tech giant Baidu to test how well their systems can perform using ImageNet. In the last few years they have got remarkably good at recognising images - with around a 5% error rate. To teach the computer to recognise images, Ms Li and her team used neural networks, computer programs assembled from artificial brain cells that learn and behave in a remarkably similar way to human brains. A neural network dedicated to interpreting pictures has anything from a few dozen to hundreds, thousands, or even millions of artificial neurons arranged in a series of layers. Each layer will recognise different elements of the picture - one will learn that there are pixels in the picture, another layer will recognise differences in the colours, a third layer will determine its shape and so on. By the time it gets to the top layer - and today's neural networks can contain up to 30 layers - it can make a pretty good guess at identifying the image. At Stanford, the image-reading machine now writes pretty accurate captions (see examples above) for a whole range of images although it does still get things wrong - so for instance a picture of a baby holding a toothbrush was wrongly labelled ""a young boy is holding a baseball bat"". Despite a decade of hard work, it still only has the visual intelligence level of a three-year-old, said Prof Li. And, unlike a toddler, it doesn't yet understand context. ""So far, we have taught the computer to see objects or even tell us a simple story when seeing a picture,"" Prof Li said. But when she asks it to assess a picture of her own son at a family celebration the machine labels it simply: ""Boy standing next to a cake"". She added: ""What the computer doesn't see is that this is a special Italian cake that's only served during Easter time."" That is the next step for the laboratory - to get machines to understand whole scenes, human behaviours and the relationships between objects. The ultimate aim is to create ""seeing"" robots that can assist in surgical operations, search out and rescue people in disaster zones and generally improve our lives for the better, said Ms Li. AI history The work into visual learning at Stanford illustrates how complex just one aspect of creating a thinking machine can be and it comes on the back of 60 years of fitful progress in the field. Back in 1950, pioneering computer scientist Alan Turing wrote a paper speculating about a thinking machine and the term ""artificial intelligence"" was coined in 1956 by Prof John McCarthy at a gathering of scientists in New Hampshire known as the Dartmouth Conference. After some heady days and big developments in the 1950s and 60s, during which both the Stanford lab and one at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology were set up, it became clear that the task of creating a thinking machine was going to be a lot harder than originally thought. There followed what was dubbed the AI winter - a period of academic dead-ends when funding for AI research dried up. But, by the 1990s, the focus in the AI community shifted from a logic-based approach - which basically involved writing a whole lot of rules for computers to follow - to a statistical one, using huge datasets and asking computers to mine them to solve problems for themselves. In the 2000s, faster processing power and the ready availability of vast amounts of data created a turning point for AI and the technology underpins many of the services we use today. It allows Amazon to recommend books, Netflix to suggest movies and Google to offer up relevant search results. Smart little algorithms began trading on Wall Street - sometimes going further than they should, as in the 2010 Flash Crash when a rogue algorithm was blamed for wiping billions off the New York stock exchange. It also provided the foundations for the voice assistants, such as Apple's Siri and Microsoft's Cortana, on smartphones. At the moment such machines are learning rather than thinking and whether a machine can ever be programmed to think is debatable given that the nature of human thought has eluded philosophers and scientists for centuries. And there will remain elements to the human mind - daydreaming for example - that machines will never replicate. But increasingly they are evaluating their knowledge and improving it and most people would agree that AI is entering a new golden age where the machine brain is only going to get smarter. AI TIMELINE",By 2050 some experts believe that machines will have reached human level intelligence.
"By Zoe KleinmanTechnology reporter, BBC News In fact, they are destined to be much more slithery. ""We try to get people to move away from the word snake because it's seen as kind of scary but even I find myself all the time calling it a snake,"" says Richard Mills from marine tech firm Kongsberg. If the idea of a swimming robot snake doesn't appeal, you might want to skip the next few paragraphs. I first mentioned Eelume to a friend who asked me whether I would be allowed to have a swim with it. I was secretly relieved that the answer was no. What started as a university robotics research project in Norway 10 years ago, has become a commercial prototype - and it is unavoidably snake-like. It's designed to inspect structures on the sea bed and carry out repairs, and is currently being tested on oil rigs. The flexible, self-propelling, tubular device has a camera at each end and is kitted out with sensors. Because it has a modular design, its parts can be switched to suit different tasks, with swappable tools including a grabber and cleaning brush. The design allows the robot to work in confined spaces that might be inaccessible to other vehicles, as well as to wriggle its body to stay in place in strong currents. And because it is designed to connect itself to a seabed dock when not in use, it can be deployed at any time whatever the surface conditions. It isn't yet on the market, but was recently on show at the Southampton's Ocean Business trade fair. Future plans already include a cheap 3D-printed model and another which can operate in very deep water. ""Something like going inside the Titanic, where divers can't, is a great opportunity that we could look at in the future,"" said Mr Mills. ""We are only limited by imagination in where we can take this vehicle."" Self-driving boats Just as driverless cars are causing excitement on land, autonomous boats are also making a splash. ""Unmanned systems allow you to focus on the data,"" said Dan Hook from UK firm ASV Global, which was also at the Southampton expo. ""You stay on board your ship in a warm, dry location, you can focus on the data and where to send the unmanned system next."" The firm's two autonomous vessels - which can also be operated via remote control - currently run on diesel generators rather than battery power. ""We're seeing increasing regulation on the types of engines we can use - it's a good thing to force you into the cleaner engines,"" he said. ""They are quieter and more efficient... but the future is electric, we're seeing it in cars, it's happening in our industry as well."" Sea batteries Batteries from the specialist battery-maker Steatite's have to function at low temperatures and high pressure, and power deep-sea devices for days at a time. Lithium-sulfur battery tech, already in the sights of electric car makers, is set to be trialled on board the famous autosub trio collectively known as Boaty McBoatface later this year - and it will be a Steatite creation. ""Lithium-sulfur is the next generation from lithium-ion,"" said the firm's Paul Edwards. ""It's got a better energy density, so you get more energy for the amount of weight you are carrying."" But if you think that it is battery life that holds marine tech back, then think again. It is more likely to be your concentration span, said Sam McDonald, president of a Canadian firm called Deep Trekker. The firm was demonstrating two remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROVs) - the larger of which was about the size of a small child. Ms McDonald said that the operator would become tired before the ROV did. ""I need to take a break after three or four hours of running it,"" she said. ""You're looking at a screen the whole time, it takes a great deal of concentration. ""You're trying to hold position under the water, looking at infrastructure or watching tools or divers work, you're constantly moving your hands and eyes,"" she explained. If that sounds exhausting imagine being in charge of a whole load of them at once. Micro-submarines Planet Ocean was showing off the ecosub - a small, thigh-sized device that looks a bit like an old shell casing and is designed to ""swim"" in shoals, with each individual sub packed with different sensors to build up collectively a strong picture of the group's watery environment. One ""pilot"" can oversee many simultaneously, and they are so small that each individual sub can only carry four or five sensors, said managing director Terry Sloane. ""If they bump into each other it's not a big disaster,"" he said. ""They only weigh 5kg [11lb] on land"". Keen to encourage recycling, Mr Sloane is prepared to offer a bounty for washed-up ecosubs that find their way to the beach - there's a hotline number on the casing for eagle-eyed beachcombers to call. ""We don't want to leave things floating around in the ocean, but it doesn't take many hours of searching for one to make it uneconomical to recover,"" he said. ""We expect people to recover them and claim a reward.""","In the near future, ocean search-and-repair specialists won't need arms or legs, according to one vision."

"Dave LeeNorth America technology reporter Zenimax Media, owner of renowned games studio id Software, is suing Facebook for $2bn (£1.6bn). Zenimax argued its early innovations in VR were unlawfully copied when Oculus built its own headset, the Rift. Oculus was bought by Facebook in 2014, and is seen as a major part of the firm’s strategy over the next 10 years. The BBC understands Mr Zuckerberg will argue that Zenimax was slow to appreciate the potential of VR - and that it was Oculus’ own work that made it the valuable technology it is today. ""We're eager to present our case in court,” a spokesman for Oculus told the BBC. ""Oculus and its founders have invested a wealth of time and money in VR because we believe it can fundamentally transform the way people interact and communicate. ""We're disappointed that another company is using wasteful litigation to attempt to take credit for technology that it did not have the vision, expertise, or patience to build.” Carmack The row revolves around John Carmack, the legendary games designer famed for titles such as Doom and Quake. The company he co-founded, id Software, is owned by Zenimax. For a short time, Mr Carmack was working for both id and Oculus - but in November 2013 he left id completely. ""When it became clear that I wasn't going to have the opportunity to do any work on VR while at id Software, I decided to not renew my contract,” he told USA Today in 2014. Zenimax now alleges that Mr Carmack shared intellectual property with Oculus while he was still working at id Software, and that when he left the company, he took that work with him. According to court papers: ""Carmack secretly and illegally copied thousands of documents containing ZeniMax's intellectual property from his computer at ZeniMax to a USB storage device which he wrongfully took with him to Oculus."" Speaking at the trial, which began last week, Zenimax lawyer Tony Sammi said it amounted to ""one of the biggest technology heists ever”. But lawyers for Mr Carmack characterised it differently, arguing that his contract explicitly allowed him to work with other companies that did not compete with Zenimax. They argued that the ""trade secrets"" Zenimax claimed to have lost were in fact ""the fruits of Mr. Carmack's participation and involvement with Palmer Luckey and Oculus"", and therefore did not belong to Zenimax. Missed the boat Facebook’s defence is that Zenimax had its chance to invest in VR but chose not to - giving Oculus no option other than to seek outside investment. The social media giant is arguing that Zenimax only showed significant interest in virtual reality after its $2bn acquisition was made public. Also crucial to the case is Palmer Luckey. Mr Luckey - who hasn’t been seen in public since revelations he was funding an online trolling campaign in support of Donald Trump - is expected to be called to the stand at some point this week. In court papers Zenimax paints Mr Luckey as a “gaming enthusiast” whose Oculus Rift headset, which was initially funded via Kickstarter, was a crude prototype. Mr Luckey, Zenimax said, lacked ""the necessary expertise and technical know-how to create a viable virtual reality headset”, and therefore relied on Zenimax to help him create the prototype which impressed Facebook. Mark Zuckerberg’s appearance is expected to last most of the day on Tuesday. On Monday, the 32-year-old posted about meeting with local communities and law enforcement groups in Dallas as part of his new year pledge to travel to 30 different US states in 2017.

"By Zoe KleinmanTechnology reporter, BBC News Jennifer Aniston, Steven Spielberg and Oprah Winfrey were among those who took to the stage at Apple's headquarters to reveal their involvement in TV projects commissioned by the tech giant. The platform will include shows from existing services like Hulu and HBO. Apple also announced that it would be launching a credit card, gaming portal and enhanced news app. The event was held in California and Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook was clear from the start that the announcements would be about new services, not new devices. It is a change of direction for the 42-year-old company. Apple TV There had been much anticipation about Apple's predicted foray into the TV streaming market, dominated by the likes of Amazon and Netflix. The Apple TV+ app was unveiled by Steven Spielberg and will launch in the autumn. Spielberg will himself be creating some material for the new platform, he said. Other stars who took to the stage included Reese Witherspoon, Steve Carell, Jason Momoa, Alfre Woodard, comedian Kumail Nanjiani and Big Bird from Sesame Street. The app will be made available on rival devices for the first time, coming to Samsung, LG, Sony and Vizio smart TVs as well as Amazon's Firestick and Roku. The subscription fee was not announced, and notably absent from the launch line-up was Netflix, which had already ruled itself out of being part of the bundle. ""The test for Apple will be, can new content separate them out from their competitors and can they commission and deliver on fresh new content that can reach audiences in the same way that Stranger Things has for Netflix for example?"" commented Dr Ed Braman, an expert in film and production at the University of York. Apple Card The Apple Card credit card will launch in the US this summer. There will be both an iPhone and physical version of the card, with a cashback incentive on every purchase. The credit card will have no late fees, annual fees or international fees, said Apple Pay VP Jennifer Bailey. It has been created with the help of Goldman Sachs and MasterCard. News stand The firm also revealed a news service, Apple News+, which will include more than 300 magazine titles including Marie Claire, Vogue, New Yorker, Esquire, National Geographic and Rolling Stone. The LA Times and the Wall Street Journal will also be part of the platform, the firm said. It added that it will not track what users read or allow advertisers to do so. Apple News+ will cost $9.99 (£7.50) per month and is available immediately in the US and Canada. It will come to Europe later in the year. Unlike TV+, the news platform will only be available on Apple devices. Gaming A new games platform, Apple Arcade, will offer over 100 exclusive games from the app store which will all be playable offline, in contrast with Google's recently announced streaming platform Stadia. It will be rolled out across 150 countries in the autumn but no subscription prices were given. in 2018 analyst firm IHS Markit valued the global gaming market on iOS, Apple's operating system, at $33.5bn. There is space within that market for a platform like Apple Arcade which is not financed by in-app purchases or advertising, said IHS director of games research Piers Harding-Rolls. ""Apple's decision to move up the games value chain with a new, curated subscription service and to support the development of exclusive games for its Arcade platform is a significant escalation of the company's commitment to the games market,"" he said. ""Apple joins the other technology companies Microsoft, Facebook, Google, Amazon and others in investing directly in games content and services."" Apple is making an aggressive push into several markets in which, thanks to sheer scale alone, it immediately becomes a massive player. Its TV service has been long in the making, and Apple has amassed a roster of big stars, as expected. A bigger test will be how creative those ideas will be - a lot of Netflix's success has been about finding new talent, not throwing money at already famous names. I also have reservations about how many boundaries Apple will be prepared to push with its creative endeavours: if it's as controlling with its television as it is with its brand, it will create a catalogue bereft of risk-taking. But TV is just a small part of what Apple is going for here. It wants (and needs) to turn its devices into the portal through which you do everything else - TV/film, gaming, reading the news... and you'd presume other things in the very near future. The announcement of a credit card shows how far Apple is prepared to go to make sure life is experienced through your iPhone. As Oprah put it on stage: ""They're in a billion pockets, y'all.""","Apple has unveiled its new TV streaming platform, Apple TV+, at a star-studded event in California."
"They have alleged the site and its operators ""facilitated, encouraged, and profited"" from copyright infringement. Megaupload was one of the largest file-sharing sites before it was shut by US regulators in 2012 who have accused it of costing copyright holders more than $500m (£320m) in lost revenue. Mr Dotcom has denied those charges, saying the site was a storage service. 'Paid users' In a statement, Steven Fabrizio, global general counsel of the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), said: ""When Megaupload.com was shut down in 2012 by US law enforcement, it was by all estimates the largest and most active infringing website targeting creative content in the world."" The MPAA alleged that Megaupload used to pay users for uploading popular content and as a result was not a storage service. ""Megaupload was built on an incentive system that rewarded users for uploading the most popular content to the site, which was almost always stolen movies, TV shows and other commercial entertainment content,"" said Mr Fabrizio. ""It paid users based on how many times the content was downloaded by others - and didn't pay at all until that infringing content was downloaded 10,000 times. ""Megaupload wasn't a cloud storage service at all, it was an unlawful hub for mass distribution,"" he added. However, Mr Dotcom rejected those claims. He tweeted that files bigger than 100MB in size ""did not earn rewards"". ""Hollywood claims that we were paying users to upload pirated movies. Stupid."" Mr Dotcom has fought a long-running legal battle over the case in New Zealand where he lives. He is fighting extradition to the US over charges of copyright infringement on a ""massive scale"". Megaupload had about 150 million registered users before it was shut down. At one point it was estimated to be the 13th most frequently visited website. In January 2013, a year after the closure of MegaUpload, Mr Dotcom set up Mega, which also allows users to host and share large files on the internet.","Six of the biggest movie studios have sued Megaupload and its key operators, including founder Kim Dotcom."
"Two proposals have won approval from key internet bodies that will limit how widely information is shared about sites hosted on Tor. Some of this information has previously been leaked, potentially giving attackers a way to track users. The move should also make it easier for sites that are hosted on Tor to encrypt data passing to and from users. Security layers Tor, or The Onion Router, lets people browse the web anonymously by shuttling data through several different computers and encrypting it at every step. This network has also become host to many sites that use a .onion suffix in a similar way to the way domains such as .com and .org are used on the world wide web. Many different organisations, including Facebook, whistle-blowing sites and drug marketplaces, use .onion sites because they help to protect the identity of their users. Before now, when the names of .onion sites were included in some applications many computers tried to locate them by consulting the web's public lists of where all websites are found. The query would produce no useful location information but could be used by eavesdroppers to track down people using the anonymising Tor network. Privacy campaigners Jacob Appelbaum and Alec Muffet have tabled two proposals designed to to stop this data leakage by giving the .onion domain special status and by making developers handle the suffix properly. This would stop computers and browsers looking on the web for information about sites that only exist on Tor. Iana, the net administration body that oversees domains, approved the .onion domain proposal this week. In addition, the Internet Engineering Task Force, which works on ways to improve the net, has accepted the other proposals that should stop web applications and programs wrongly seeking information about Tor sites. Together, the two proposals will also make it easier for .onion sites to add encryption to protect users further. ""This enables the Tor .onion ecosystem to benefit from the same level of security you can get in the rest of the web,"" Richard Barnes, Mozilla's security head for Firefox told news site Motherboard. ""It adds a layer of security on top.""","The Tor network is being given help to keep secret what is done via the ""dark web"" system."
"By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor Council staff and healthcare workers on the Isle of Wight will be invited to install it on Tuesday, ahead of a wider roll-out on the island on Thursday. Project chiefs have said their so-called ""centralised"" approach gives them advantages over a rival scheme advocated by the US tech giants and some privacy experts. But fresh concerns have been raised. The Information Commissioner's Office has declared that ""as a general rule, a decentralised approach"" would better follow its principle that organisations should minimise the amount of personal data they collect. The House of Commons' Human Rights Select Committee also discussed fears about plans to extend the app to record location data. ""There is an inherent risk that if you create a system that can be added to incrementally, you could do so in a way that is very privacy invasive,"" cautioned law professor Orla Lynskey. But NHSX - the health service's digital innovation unit - has stressed that: ""Please download the app to protect the NHS and save lives,"" Health Secretary Matt Hancock urged Isle of Wight residents. ""By downloading the app, you're protecting your own health, you're protecting the health of your loved ones, and the health of the community."" Wireless signals The NHS Covid-19 app is intended to supplement medical tests and contact-tracing interviews carried out by humans, in order to prevent a resurgence of Covid-19 when lockdown measures are eased. It works by using Bluetooth signals to detect when two people's smartphones are close to each other. If one person later registers themselves as being infected, an alert can be sent to others judged to be at high risk of contagion. This might be based on the fact they were exposed to the same person for a long period of time or that there had been multiple instances of them being in the vicinity of different people. The trial on the Isle of Wight will help NHSX test how well the system works in practice, as well as judge how willing a population is to install and use the software. It follows a smaller experiment on an RAF base. Although the app is live, it is effectively hidden on the iOS and Android marketplaces, and residents will need to follow a set of instructions to install it. While in theory there is nothing to prevent the details being shared and used by others elsewhere, NHSX hopes this will not happen as it could confuse the feedback it receives. Ahead of the trial, NHSX chief Matthew Gould acknowledged that there would ""inevitably be unintended consequences"" and that ""if we think there is a better way of doing what we need to do, we won't hesitate to change"". But he added that if citizens ""want to carry on saving lives, protecting the NHS and get the country back on its feet, then downloading the app is one way they can do that"". More data NHSX's app will send back details of the logged Bluetooth ""handshakes"" to a UK-based computer server to do the contact matching, rather carrying out the process on the handsets themselves. Apple, Google and hundreds of privacy advocates have raised concerns that this risks hackers or even the state itself being able to re-identify anonymised users, and thus learn details about their social circles. But NHSX has consulted ethicists and GCHQ's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) on the matter, and believes safeguards are in place to minimise the risk of this happening. Furthermore, it believes any such concerns are outweighed by the benefits of adopting a centralised approach. It says a centralised app will let it: NHSX believes another major benefit is that its app can make use of people self-diagnosing themselves before they obtain test results. This would only be possible, Mr Gould explained, because NHSX could spot ""anomalous patterns of activity"" indicating that people were lying to the app for malicious reasons. But the DP3T group - which promotes the decentralised approach - believes this claim is misleading. ""I have not seen any evidence that this would do anything but spot very large-scale and quite clumsy attacks,"" explained Prof Michael Veale. ""The only way to make sure that people can be held to account for submitting false reports is to identify them [which takes you down] a slippery slope."" Another criticism of NHSX's approach is that it puts the UK at odds with Ireland, Germany, Switzerland and a growing list of other nations, which are pursuing decentralised apps. The fear is that UK citizens may face tougher restrictions on international travel if its system is not interoperable with others. Mr Gould said that NHSX was ""talking to a range of countries [to] make sure that systems can talk to each other,"" adding that France and Japan were among others developing centralised apps. But Prof Veale warned that any attempt to try to join up the two systems risked ""the worst of both worlds"". ""I don't think it's just a mater of political will. It would be a matter of sacrificing the privacy-by-design within both systems."" The Isle of Wight's Green Party - which has nine locally-elected councillors - has also expressed its doubts. ""The Isle of Wight has a significantly older and more vulnerable population [and] the island's one hospital could be overwhelmed if... people feel they do no need to stick to lockdown measures due to the rolling out of this app,"" it said. But the government's coordinator for testing said the island was ""well-equipped"" to cope. ""It's quite a large population and there is a benefit in the fact that travel on and off the island is relatively restricted - the ferries are there, but they're running relatively infrequently,"" added Public Health England's Prof John Newton. ""So it is an ideal place to look at the epidemiology and see the impact.""",A test version of the NHS's coronavirus contact-tracing app has been published to Apple and Google's app stores.
"By Pauline MasonTechnology reporter But in a lab deep in the basement of Imperial College in London, a young team has built what it believes is the future of air travel. H2Go Power is seeking a patent to store the explosive gas cheaply and safely. Until now, storing hydrogen required ultra-strong and large tanks which could withstand pressures of up to 10,000 pound-force per square inch (psi). That is hundreds of times greater than what you would find in a car tyre. But, while studying for her PhD in Cambridge, Dr Enass Abo-Hamed came up with a revolutionary structure which could store hydrogen as a stable solid without compression. ""The pressure involved is similar to what you'd get in a coffee machine,"" she says. The university paired her with materials scientist, Luke Sperrin, to try to find commercial applications for the innovation - and H2Go Power was born. Test flight Dr Sperrin is now chief technology officer. He and Dr Abo-Hamed formed a partnership with Canadian hydrogen fuel cell maker Ballard a year ago to create a drone which used their reactor to safely store hydrogen for flight. Finally, after months of collaboration by phone and email, Mr Sperrin and chief product developer Peter Italiano flew to Boston for a ground-breaking test flight. ""Of course you need really good weather to fly a drone,"" smiles Mr Sperrin. ""And it poured with rain for the first few days. We weren't even sure whether we'd even be able to go ahead. ""So when it did fly, it was a huge relief."" How it works The aluminium reactor weighs less than a bag of sugar. The small gas cylinder has an intricate network of 3D-printed aluminium tubes inside. The hydrogen remains stable and solid in these structures until ""coolant"" is pumped through the tubes, warming them and releasing hydrogen gas to the drone's fuel cell Hydrogen (H2) is pumped into one side of the fuel cell through a catalyst which frees electrons, creating electricity. Oxygen (O) is then pumped into the other side of the fuel cell and combines with the left over, positively-charged hydrogen atoms (H+). The only final waste product is water vapour (H2O). Never-ending supply Until recently, a major hurdle to affordable hydrogen technologies was the cost of producing hydrogen gas. Splitting water molecules into hydrogen used a lot of energy which usually came from fossil fuel sources. However, the widespread availability of renewable energy and improvements in electrolysis - the chemical process of separating elements using electricity - have brought down the financial and environmental cost of producing hydrogen for fuel. Currently most countries have strict safety rules about flying drones over heavily populated areas. Collision or technical failure could cause a drone to drop out of the sky. Lithium-ion (Li-on) batteries are highly flammable, so a crash landing could trigger an explosion. But, Dr Abo-Hamed points out, even if their drone fell out of the sky, the hydrogen would remain stable in its solid form inside the reactor. Super fuel ""Hydrogen is a happy gas,"" continues Dr Abo-Hamed. ""It wants to move around."" That's what makes it so explosive. But, it also delivers more bang for your buck. Hydrogen generates three times as much power per kilogram compared to fossil fuels - approximately 39.0 Kilowatt hours per kilogram compared with roughly 13 kWh per kg for kerosene or petrol or just 0.2 kWh for conventional lithium ion batteries. That means a hydrogen-powered drone can fly further than a battery-powered drone and, potentially, carry heavier loads. Dr Abo-Hamed is excited about the possibilities for her innovation. ""So if drones could stay longer in the sky, they can deliver medicine,"" she says. ""Or scan a disaster area and send the information back. ""My dream really is not just to make drones. ""Maybe in the next twenty or thirty years we could de-carbonise air travel, which is something really important for our climate.""","When you think about hydrogen and flight, the image that comes to mind for most is the Hindenburg airship in flames."
"It is the first time such action has been taken since China reformed its gaming regulator last year. In this case, the unnamed company that fell foul of the law has been fined seven times the revenue it earned from the game, or 700,000 yuan (£75,800). Developers in China are required to seek a licence for each game they make before distributing it. Authorities said the game was a mobile title, made by a firm in Beijing. According to Abacus News, which first reported the fine, Chinese officials recently lifted a freeze on the licensing of new games but are still not approving as many titles as they used to before the freeze. China's stance on video games has become increasingly strict in recent years. Last month, the country launched a new curfew for online gamers under the age of 18 meaning they are now banned from playing between 22:00 and 08:00. Sessions are also limited to 90 minutes on weekdays and three hours at weekends. Gaming remains hugely popular in the country. In the five years to 2023, the number of mobile gamers in China is expected to rise from 598 million to 728 million, according to market research firm Niko.",A game launched in China without government approval has landed the company behind it with a heavy fine.
"Reeves is auctioning a 15-minute Zoom call for a children's cancer charity. The highest bid at time of writing is $9,800 (£7,800). Meanwhile, on the celebrity message platform Cameo, $1,000 will buy a 10-minute Zoom call with Star Trek actor Jonathan Frakes or skateboarder Tony Hawk. Cameo said there had been ""a tonne of interest"" in its Zoom service, Cameo Live, despite just 31 celebrities - only four of whom are women - signing up since launch, on Sunday. The start-up, which launched in 2017, also offers short recorded personal messages from a range of celebrities including reality TV personalities and sports stars, who charge various fees. ""Cameo Live is very similar to a backstage pass at a concert or a meet-and-greet at an autographic signing,"" spokesman Brandon Kazimer told BBC News. ""This is just the newest iteration of fan-talent access."" Mr Kazimer said bookings were a mixture of fans buying video calls as gifts for themselves or for friends, and businesses purchasing them for office events and speaking engagements. Founder Steven Galanis told Fast Company celebrities offering the recorded messages had dropped their prices by an average of 27% during lockdown. ""We're in this really weird environment where every athlete, actor, celebrity finds themselves basically with nothing to do,"" he said. US comedian Tony Atamanuik tweeted about joining the platform back in March. ""You want to pay me 25 bucks to say or do whatever, I will,"" he said. ""I'm shut in my house and I'm going insane.""",Actors Keanu Reeves and Jonathan Frakes are among the celebrities offering fans the opportunity to chat one-to-one via Zoom during lockdown.
"By Mark WardTechnology correspondent, BBC News They do this because the number of machines they control fluctuates moment by moment as some are disinfected, turned off or taken over by rivals. But there are some machines they can depend on for a long time. They sit on the same IP addresses and keep on spewing spam for years and years. Junk mountain Dave Rand, founder and overseer of the Mail Abuse Prevention System (MAPS), knows which UK IP addresses have been sending spam the longest. Anyone who thinks they get a lot of spam should talk to him about the scale of the problem as he has built his career around junk mail. Every day, between 100 and 200 million junk mail messages find their way to the network Mr Rand runs. He gets so many because he has run his domain for a long time and has been active in anti-spam circles for almost the same amount of time. He has become the authority on spam origins, and MAPS publishes lists of the biggest spewers of junk messages to help ISPs and others block the messages at source. Mr Rand set up MAPS to tackle the big spam problem he had back in 1995. ""I was getting the ridiculous quantity of 1-2 spam messages per day,"" he said. ""I found that completely intolerable. I started to record those and out of that came MAPS."" The data he holds reveals that there are some IP addresses in the UK that have been sending out junk mail for years and years. Mr Rand provided a few to the BBC for this investigation. Some of the IP addresses the BBC looked into were overseen by business ISPs and hosting companies, or were for small businesses that ran their own IT. Many of the addresses he supplied started sending spam in 2004 and, bar the occasional hiatus, have kept sending a steady stream of junk ever since. Some have sent so much spam that the IP address they use is blocked so any mail received from it is deleted. One IP address that has sent hundreds of thousands of junk messages is on 14 separate block lists. Net scanning Analysis of the machines using publicly available tools reveals that many are poorly configured Windows machines sitting on a badly administered network. Many are servers running software that has not been regularly updated. Some run software, such as Squirrelmail, which is well known for having loopholes spammers can exploit. Cybercriminals scan the net looking for the version numbers of the programs a server is running, seeking out vulnerable versions. Some of the machines the BBC investigated send out spam for fake drugs such as viagra. Others are used as so-called dictionary attackers in which servers are battered with combinations of popular words in a bid to uncover passwords. Machines sitting on a couple of the addresses were being used to send out destructive viruses or malicious programs that tried to enrol more machines into a botnet. Alex De Joode, chief security officer at hosting firm LeaseWeb, said it was not surprising that such machines could sit churning out spam for years. ""Most hosting companies do not know exactly what traffic enters and leaves their network,"" he said. ""If no-one on the internet complains about it, there's no reason for you to investigate that server."" A business ISP could be controlling tens of thousands of IP addresses, he said, and would simply not have time to investigate all the complaints that come in about them. Lawmakers He said the fractured nature of the net meant that tracing where spam was coming from and doing something about it could be tricky - and could soak up resources a small firm could use more productively. ""If you are a small ISP and have only a few employees, then your main worry is tracking customers not abuse handling,"" he said. ""And if it's a business ISP the server may not be under their control."" Mr Rand said the problem had become so big because the cost equation was heavily tilted in favour of spammers. ""The ISPs will never save money stopping spam,"" he said. ""The cost to the spammer of sending junk is zero, so no matter what response rates they get, anything greater than zero is a win."" Many ISPs might claim that spam was becoming a solved problem as far less of it made it through to email inboxes, but that did not mean it was not a problem, said Mr De Joode. ""It's not just emails filling your inbox,"" he said. ""It's the route into the world of cybercrime."" Spam is a way for criminals to start generating cash, it allows them to recruit money mules and often relies on hijacked PCs that can be plundered for personal information. Mr Rand said he was generally not in favour of governments getting involved in industry issues, but the spam problem was so big and so persistent that it might be time for them to intervene. Government involvement or threats to hold ISPs accountable if they did not do more to tackle spam might spur a big change, he said. ""Maybe its legislation we need, maybe its threats of legislation,"" he said. ""We need help.""",Criminals in charge of botnets are always trying to extend their reach over more and more machines.
"The Copyright Alert System (Cas), notified internet subscribers whose accounts had been used to download copyrighted content for free. Copyright holders hailed the scheme a success, despite its closure. But critics said there was no evidence to show that the system had brought down piracy levels. Content bodies, such as the RIAA (Recording Industry Association of America ) and the MPAA (Motion Picture Association of America) have long lobbied for greater punishments for content-stealing and finally agreed the ""six strikes"" plan with several of the US's large internet service providers in 2013. Under the scheme, millions of notices were sent to consumers believed to have downloaded content without paying for it. Throttled The system was complex - the first two notices were purely educational, the third and fourth required a response from the consumer and on the fifth and sixth notices, consumers might face punishments - such as having their internet speeds throttled. This was left up to the internet service provider, which could also terminate the account if it wanted to. The Center for Copyright Information, which administered the system, explained that it had now been dropped. ""After four years of extensive consumer education and engagement, the Copyright Alert System will conclude its work. The programme demonstrated that real progress is possible when content creators, internet innovators and consumer advocates come together in a collaborative and consensus-driven process."" Little information was available about how successful the scheme had been although it appears that no action was taken against those who received six strikes. According to the Center for Copyright Information, 1.3 million alerts were sent out in the programme's first 10 months and fewer than than 3% of those were sixth strikes. MPAA lawyer Steven Fabrizio said in a statement: ""While CAS demonstrates that a significant number of users who received alerts stopped engaging in piracy, fulfilling CAS' educational goal, a persistent group of hard-core, repeat infringers are unlikely to change their behaviour. 'Less effective' Ernesto van der Sar, editor of piracy news website TorrentFreak told the BBC, copyright holders and ISPs have been working on an improved version of the Cas for more than a year but had failed to reach agreement. ""In recent years a lot of copyright infringement has moved away from BitTorrent networks to streaming and direct downloading, which isn't covered by the programme. This has made the warning system less effective on a grander scale,"" he said. In May 2015, the Internet Security Task Force, which represents a range of film studios, criticised the system as ineffective. It used the example of the film Expendables 3 which it claimed had been illegally viewed ""more than 60 million times"". Mr van der Sar added: ""The news doesn't reflect well on the Get it Right programme, which is the UK equivalent of the Copyright Alerts System without the mitigation measures."" UK ISPs have just begun sending out warning emails to customers identified as having their connection used for illegally downloading content. The notifications advise consumers about legal alternatives, rather than threaten any form of punishment. A spokesman for the Get it Right campaign said its programme was having a ""positive impact"" in educating consumers about the legal options for enjoying content. ""Almost a quarter of the population have now been exposed to the campaign in some way and amongst this group, early results from the campaign show a drop in piracy,"" he said.","A controversial programme that could have seen persistent content-pirates have their internet access cut off, has been stopped in the US."
"By Dave LeeTechnology reporter, BBC News Many popular apps are free to download, but are designed to tempt users to pay for in-game enhancements - often allowing for quicker progression. The Commission is now forcing Apple and Google, the biggest vendors of apps, to make the ""true cost"" of games clear. But it singled out Apple for not making a commitment to change. ""Regrettably, no concrete and immediate solutions have been made by Apple to date to address the concerns linked in particular to payment authorisation,"" the Commission said in a statement. ""Apple has proposed to address those concerns. However, no firm commitment and no timing have been provided for the implementation of such possible future changes. ""CPC [consumer protection co-operation] authorities will continue to engage with Apple to ensure that it provides specific details of changes required and put its practices into line with the common position."" The Commission said national authorities had the option to take legal action against companies that were deemed not to be complying with Europe's guidance on free apps. 'Strengthen protections' In a statement, Apple said it was doing ""more than others"" to protect parents. ""These controls go far beyond the features of others in the industry,"" an Apple spokesman said. ""But we are always working to strengthen the protections we have in place, and we're adding great new features with iOS 8, such as Ask to Buy, giving parents even more control over what their kids can buy on the App Store."" Google is said to have decided on a number of changes due to come into force by September. Europe's rules on apps In December last year, the European Commission asked app vendors to take steps to ensure: The Commission said: ""These include not using the word ""free"" at all when games contain in-app purchases, developing targeted guidelines for its app developers to prevent direct exhortation to children as defined under EU law, and time-framed measures to help monitor apparent breaches of EU consumer laws. ""It has also adapted its default settings, so that payments are authorised prior to every in-app purchase, unless the consumer actively chooses to modify these settings."" As the app market has boomed, in-app purchases have been a point of controversy between consumers and technology companies. Huge bills Unlike the traditional business model for games - where a title will be purchased outright - the so-called freemium model has proved particularly lucrative for games makers. However, there has been criticism that it is too easy for players, particularly children, to find themselves with huge bills as a result. In some cases, in-app purchases cost well over £100. Google, Apple and Amazon have all faced legal action relating to claims they mislead customers. Last year, Apple agreed to refund parents $32.5m (£19.9m) as part of an agreement with the US Federal Trade Commission. Apple will soon update its iOS mobile operating system to include more safeguards for parents to prevent accidental purchases within apps. European Commission vice-president Neelie Kroes said: ""The Commission is very supportive of innovation in the app sector. ""In-app purchases are a legitimate business model, but it's essential for app-makers to understand and respect EU law while they develop these new business models."" Tiga, the trade association for games developers in the UK, welcomed the guidance but stressed free-to-play's role as an important revenue stream for businesses. ""Our own findings show that 95% of consumers never pay anything for free-to-play games. ""So given this is a model which generally delivers fantastic value for consumers, this co-ordinated approach will help protect that value, and ensure a bright long-term future for the free-to-play sector.""

"The Department of Health said most of those affected had subsequently been contacted with the correct information. People had been told to isolate for too long, rather than being told they could mix with others too soon, it added. The mistake - which was first reported by Sky News - follows a series of other software-based Covid-19 foul-ups. Last month, the BBC revealed how an oversight in the use of Microsoft's Excel software led to nearly 16,000 coronavirus cases going unreported in England. And on the weekend, the Sunday Times reported that a risk-score threshold used by the NHS Covid-19 app to trigger self-isolate alerts had been lowered weeks later than intended. In that case, officials are still carrying out checks to identify the ""root cause"". October error A total of 7,230 individuals were involved in the latest error. Officials believe it resulted from an internal update to the system used by human contact tracers, who identify people believed to have recently been close to those diagnosed with the coronavirus. The system is used to calculate how long the original person who tested positive should keep away from others. It also does the isolation calculation for those they had been in close proximity to, who are contacted via follow-up phone calls, emails and/or text messages. It is completely separate to the automated contact tracing system used by the app. The update was made on 22 October and affected a total of 7,230 people before the problem was rectified on 27 October. Of those: ""We have reassessed the self-isolation periods for a number of people who were contact traced, following close contact with someone who tested positive for Covid-19,"" a Department of Health and Social Care spokeswoman said.","More than 7,200 people in England were told to stop self-isolating on the wrong date by the Test and Trace scheme as a result of a software error."
"The Electronic Frontier Foundation found the Ring app was ""packed"" with third-party tracking, sending out customers' personally identifiable information. Five companies were receiving a range of information, including names, IP addresses and mobile networks, it said. Ring said it limited the amount of data it shared. The company told Gizmodo: ""Like many companies, Ring uses third-party service providers to evaluate the use of our mobile app, which helps us improve features, optimise the customer experience and evaluate the effectiveness of our marketing."" But the EFF said Ring was failing to protect users' privacy, noting only one of the trackers it had found was mentioned in the company's privacy policy. ""The danger in sending even small bits of information is that analytics and tracking companies are able to combine these bits together to form a unique picture of the user's device,"" the EFF said. ""This cohesive whole represents a fingerprint that follows the user as they interact with other apps and use their device, in essence providing trackers the ability to spy on what a users is doing in their digital lives and when they re doing it."" The five companies identified as receiving information were: Out of these, only MixPanel is mentioned in Ring's privacy notice, along with Google Analytics, HotJar and Optimizely. The investigation by EFF tested Ring for Android, version 3.21.1. 'Shut down' Amazon, which bought Ring in 2018 and sells a range of home security cameras as well as doorbells, has been criticised for partnering with at least 200 law-enforcement agencies to carry out surveillance via its devices. Digital rights campaign group Fight for the Future said at the time Amazon was encouraging neighbours to spy on each other. And last year, there was a series of stories about Ring cameras being hacked. One Alabama-based man, who claims a hacker spoke to his children via his Ring camera, is leading a group legal action against the company over the security of its products. Writing on Medium this weekend, Max Eliaser, one of Amazon's software development engineers, called for Ring to ""be shut down immediately and not brought back"". ""The deployment of connected home security cameras that allows footage to be queried centrally are simply not compatible with a free society,"" he wrote in an article seeking the views of Amazon employees on a range of issues.","Ring doorbells are providing customer data to companies such as Facebook and Google, an investigation suggests."
"An inflatable structure would be transported from Earth, then covered with a shell built by 3D printers. The printers, operated by robots, would use soil from the Moon, known as regolith, to build the layered cover. The proposed site for the building is the southern pole of the Moon. It is designed to house four people and could be extended, the firm said. In 2010 a team of researchers from Washington State University found that artificial regolith containing silicon, aluminium, calcium, iron and magnesium oxide could be used by 3D printers to create solid objects. The latest plans are the result of a collaboration between a number of organisations including the European Space Agency. The consortium tested the practicalities of using a printer on the Moon by setting up a D-shape 3D printer, which are used to print very large house-sized structures, in a vacuum chamber with simulated lunar material. 'Fascinating and unique' ""As a practice, we are used to designing for extreme climates on Earth and exploiting the environmental benefits of using local, sustainable materials,"" said Xavier De Kestelier, a partner in the firm's specialist modelling group. ""It has been a fascinating and unique design process, which has been driven by the possibilities inherent in the material."" Buildings on this planet by the architect firm include Wembley Stadium, the World Trade Center in New York and Beijing airport. Last week US company Deep Space Industries (DSI) announced plans to use asteroid material for manufacture by harvesting them and using 3D printers sent into space. The company is also developing a bespoke 3D printer called MicroGravity Foundry for the purpose, it said, and hopes to be ready to start production by 2020.",Architects Fosters and Partners have revealed designs for a building on the Moon that could be constructed from material already on its surface.
"On its Twitter feed, the firm reported a second outage this afternoon - which was restored less than an hour later. ""Internet of North Korea down again at 15.41 UTC. Second blackout since last night's restoration of service,"" the tweet read. The first outage saw large parts of the internet unavailable in North Korea. Officials have not yet commented on the issue. Speculation is rife about the source of the blackouts, following a cyber security row with the US. China has denounced reports suggesting it was responsible. US officials have not commented on any possible American involvement. The US had said it would launch a proportional response to the hacking of Sony Pictures, after an FBI investigation appeared to show that North Korea was behind the hack attack which led to films and private emails being leaked online. The Interview, which depicts the assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, was cancelled by Sony following threats from hackers. Korean net Internet services in North Korea were down for around nine and a half hours in the first outage, according to Dyn Research. Some questioned how much an outage would affect a country where normal citizens have little access to the web. Although many have computers and smartphones, they only have access to a government-approved intranet. Access to the world wide web is reserved for a trusted elite in North Korean society. North Korea's internet is handled by state-run company Star Join Ventures which is routed through Chinese telecommunications firm China Unicom.","North Korea appears to have suffered a second internet blackout, according to internet performance measuring firm Dyn Research."
"Security organisations had previously identified Iran as one of at least eight countries targeted by the code. The spyware is believed to have been designed to steal data to help launch further cyber attacks. The sender has not been identified, but researchers have found a reference to a US television programme in Duqu's code. The Iranian news agency, IRNA, reported that the country's cyber defence unit was taking steps to combat the infection. ""The software to control the virus has been developed and made available to organisations and corporations,"" Brigadier General Gholamreza Jalali, head of Iran's civil defence body, is quoted as saying. ""All the organisations and centres that could be susceptible to being contaminated are being controlled."" Mr Jalali said a ""final report"" into which organisations had been targeted was still being worked on. Third attack? Last year the Iranian government accused the West of trying to disrupt its nuclear facilities using the Stuxnet worm computer attack. Then in April 2011 officials said the country's facilities had been targeted by a second piece of malware dubbed ""Stars"". Officials now describe the Duqu attack as the ""third virus"" to hit Iran. The computer security specialist Kaspersky Lab said it believed that ""Stars"" was a keylogging program that may have been part of the same attack that installed Duqu. Keylogging programs are able to collect information about a computer system, take screenshots, search for files and capture passwords. Thrillers The firm also provided more detail about how Duqu worked based on its analysis of other targets. It said another unidentified company received an email from an individual identifying himself as Mr B Jason who requested a joint business venture. The firm believed this was a reference to the Jason Bourne books and spy movies. The recipient was asked to open a Microsoft Word attachment that referenced the targeted company's name in its title, and thus did not appear to be spam. It said that for every victim a separate set of attack files was created using a different control server. The firm said this happened at least 12 times. When the addressee opened the file the malware became active through a Truetype font exploit, but did nothing until it detected that there had been no keyboard or mouse activity for ten minutes. Kaspersky Lab said the font was called Dexter Regular and its creators were identified as Showtime Inc. ""This is another prank pulled by the Duqu authors, since Showtime Inc is the cable broadcasting company behind the TV series Dexter, about a CSI doctor who happens also to be a serial killer,"" the report said. The firm said the exploit then loaded a driver onto the system. Analysis of the driver suggested it was compiled as long ago as August 2007. ""If this information is correct, then the authors of Duqu must have been working on this project for over four years,"" the report said. The firm said the driver then began a process that led to the Duqu trojan being installed allowing the attackers to introduce new modules, infect other networked computers, and collect information. The company said efforts to identify the attackers have been complicated by the fact that the suspects appear to have deactivated several of the control servers thought to have been involved in the attacks.","Iran has confirmed some of its computer systems were infected with the Duqu trojan, but said it has found a way to control the malware."
"The voice-activated assistant is now automatically searching NHS web pages to find answers to medical questions. And the government hopes it will reduce the demand on human doctors. But the move has split opinion among artificial intelligence (AI) experts and data ethicists. ""The sensitive data holdings of a national healthcare provider like the NHS are a form of 'critical social infrastructure',"" said Berlin-based tech expert Mathana Stender. ""Yet they've been handed to a foreign company that's both a defence contractor and targeted advertiser,"" NHS GP David Wrigley asked, among other things, whether the questions asked via Alexa would be encrypted and who would store any data relating to patient queries. Amazon has said all data would be kept confidential. The NHS has increasingly partnered with private companies to offer access to its services. Notably, Babylon Health, Push Doctor and Now GP all allow video appointments with GPs to be made remotely. Babylon Health, for example, says only patients and staff involved in service provision have access to patient medical records. It adds that all data is encrypted and held in English data centres. Amazon said multiple layers of authentication would protect the data from UK customers and that all information would be encrypted. Some commentators felt that the service did not present obvious risks to users' privacy. Areeq Chowdhury, at the Future Advocacy think tank, pointed out that Alexa already responded to health queries from users. ""Now the advice (which will be better and more accurate) will come from the NHS website,"" he tweeted. New Scientist's deputy news editor Jacob Aron said the ""fuss"" over the partnership was ""ridiculous"". ""It's just a Google search you talk to, and at least people will get NHS [information]."" There was another issue at stake, however. Some pointed out that Amazon is known to have major ambitions in the healthcare industry. During 2018 the firm took a number of steps in this direction - including pairing up with Omron Healthcare to allow a blood pressure monitor to be controlled via Alexa. It also announced software that could automatically analyse electronic health records for information that could be useful to doctors. The tool will use AI to pick out important details from medical documents - including ""hospital admission notes and a patient's medical history"". Some have asked whether the NHS-Alexa partnership will allow Amazon to gather yet more data on how patients raise medical concerns. ""Is Amazon training its algorithm... on NHS patients' queries?"" asked data privacy campaigner Phil Booth. Amazon said that it would not sell products or make product recommendations based on the data collected as part of the NHS partnership. The firm also confirmed that it would not build a health profile of users who asked Alexa health-related questions.",Worried about a lump? Got a nasty cough that won't budge? Many people Google queries about such symptoms daily - but now they can get NHS advice instantly by asking Amazon's Alexa.
"Created by American scientists, the components exploit properties of carefully engineered silicon slices to hold and quickly deliver a charge. Renewable energy sources could also benefit from the work on the cheaper super-capacitors. The silicon components should be easy to add to existing chip-production systems, said the researchers. Solar storage Super-capacitors built from carbon are already used as energy storage systems in electric vehicles and in wind turbines to ensure blades turn smoothly, but their bulk and cost have limited them to these niche applications. Scientists in the engineering department at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee tested different materials to see if they could be used to reduce the cost and size of these super-capacitors. Silicon became a good candidate when the Vanderbilt team found a way to apply a coat of graphene that was only a few nanometres thick. This coating was needed to stop the silicon reacting with the chemicals that provide the ions used to store an electrical charge. The team, headed by engineering professor Cary Pint, used porous silicon in their research because the method of etching billions of tiny pits on to the material is well established. All those nano-scale features give the material a huge surface area relative to its size and help it store a significant electrical charge. Writing in a paper in the journal Nature, the scientists explained how the coating bestowed on the silicon properties similar to those seen in commercial super-capacitors. It allows them to dispense their stored power quickly and last much longer than current re-chargeable batteries. The team is now looking into ways to integrate the coated silicon into existing manufacturing processes so the super-capacitors can be more widely used in gadgets such as phones. One of the first applications of the work could be as a storage system for solar power plants. Super-capacitors on the rear of solar cells could store power as it is collected and then dispense it during the night when demand grows. ""All the things that define us in a modern environment require electricity,"" said Prof Pint. ""The more that we can integrate power storage into existing materials and devices, the more compact and efficient they will become.""",Phone batteries that recharge in minutes and last for weeks could result from work on silicon super-capacitors.
"By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter The robot is currently based at Middlesex University, working with students and appearing at events. MPs smiled when the robot was wheeled in, although both questions and answers were pre-arranged. Tory MP Lucy Allan joked that Pepper was ""better than some of the ministers we have had before us"". The Education Committee is looking at the impact technologies such as AI and robotics will have on education. After introducing itself, Pepper told MPs: ""Robots will have an important role to play - but we will always need the soft skills that are unique to humans to sense, make and drive value from technology."" Labour MP James Frith asked all the questions, possibly because he was sitting closest to Pepper. He delivered them loudly and slowly to ensure Pepper understood. Pepper is used by students on a series of projects, including: It also attends Stem (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) fairs and conferences. A handful of universities and schools around the UK now own a Pepper robot. They cost between £10,000 and £12,000 and can recognise faces and make eye contact. Not everyone was impressed that Pepper was representing the AI community in parliament. Professor Michael Wooldridge, head of AI at Oxford University, told the BBC it was an ""embarrassing gimmick"" which gave AI ""a bad name"". Broader curriculum The humans being questioned by the committee agreed that the current educational system had to change drastically to accommodate the pace of technological change. Brian Holliday, managing director for Siemens Digital Factory, said there was a need for greater co-operation between schools and technology companies and for educators to concentrate on not just ""knowledge-based learning"" but also ""applied learning"" from the world of work. And he disputed studies that suggest many jobs would be lost to AI or machines. ""We have taken people from the factory floor and moved them on to our digitalisation teams,"" he said, when asked about the need to re-skill the current workforce. Meanwhile, Prof Rose Luckin, from University College London's Knowledge Lab, said AI could play a useful role in the classroom, taking over mundane tasks such as data collection, assessment, administration and lesson planning. But, she added: ""If we don't get this right, too much of what we should be doing will be allocated on to machines."" Joysy John, director of education at innovation foundation Nesta, said educationalists needed to introduce a broader curriculum that took account of problem solving and critical thinking as well as preparing children for the age of machine learning and ensuring they did not fear robots and AI. It was not just computer science skills that were needed as we entered the fourth industrial revolution, she said, people with critical and creative thinking skills would also be crucial - and there was a ""high level of unemployment"" among recent computer science graduates.","Pepper has become the first robot to appear at a UK parliamentary meeting, talking to MPs about the future of artificial intelligence in education."

Nintendo ended production of its 3DS handheld in September 2020 and says it sold 75.94 million units over its nine-and-a-half year lifetime. The Switch first went on sale in 2017, and was joined by a lower-cost model - the Switch Lite - in 2019, which is also included in the tally. The firm said demand for the machines was 35.8% up on the same period the previous year, with a total of 24.1 million units sold over the last nine months of 2020. Nintendo's president Shuntaro Furukawa said that the company had sufficient components to continue producing the devices - despite wider industry shortages - and it now expected to sell 26.5 million of the consoles over the financial year as a whole. That represents 10% more than its previous guidance. He added that there were no plans to launch a successor in the near term. However, there is continued speculation the company will unveil a ""pro"" version of the Switch before the end of 2021. ""The sales success of the Switch justifies Nintendo's decision to stick with its product strategy of combining unique and innovative dedicated games hardware with compelling first-party games,"" Piers Harding-Rolls from Ampere Analysis told the BBC. ""Sometimes this approach misses the mark - see the Wii U for example - but when it works it tends to result in very successful products. ""Clearly the stand out hit is the 30-million-selling Animal Crossing: New Horizons, a gentle, sociable game that will be synonymous with lockdown for many people."" Despite the Switch's success, it still has some way to go before overtaking sales of four of the firm's other consoles: If ever it was needed, the Nintendo Switch is proof that you don't need the highest-resolution graphics or fastest processor to make great games. Sometimes people just want a cute, relaxing experience - and to be several thousand bells in debt to an entrepreneurial Japanese raccoon dog. Animal Crossing has always been a best-seller for Nintendo's consoles, but New Horizons has surpassed expectations, shifting about 31 million copies. Its blend of relaxing island life and home decoration have provided some much-needed escapism during the coronavirus pandemic. Its social features also helped friends connect, chat and visit one another's homes - at least virtually - during lockdown restrictions. Critics say New Horizons is not that dissimilar from previous games in the series. Indeed, some of the best-selling games for the Switch - such as Mario Kart 8 Deluxe - are pretty much re-releases from the flop Wii U console. But Nintendo seems to have found a winning formula with the Switch that shows no signs of slowing down.",Sales of Nintendo's Switch gaming consoles have surpassed those of their predecessor - the 3DS - despite being available for a much shorter period.
"The attack is the latest in a series of takeovers by the group of media accounts on the micro-blogging service. Other media organisations previously hit by the hackers include the BBC, Reuters, CBS, the Associated Press. And the Syrian Electronic Army has claimed responsibility for attacks that send out messages in support of Syria's President, Bashar al-Assad. The group reportedly targeted the Onion following its publication of an article mocking President Assad's reaction to the ongoing conflict in the country. In a message sent to the New York Times, the hackers behind the attack said the article had ""savaged"" Syria and hurt the feelings of many people in the country. It accused the site of being ""biased"" and said it should stick to satire. The attackers posted a series of messages and pictures to the Twitter feed, many of which had anti-Semitic content. In response, the Onion deleted the messages and sent out a series of Tweets to its five million followers, poking fun at the incident. The Syrian Electronic Army has enjoyed a series of high-profile successes against the Twitter accounts of media groups and news organisations. Its main tactic involves sending email messages containing a web link that takes victims to a fake Gmail or Outlook log-in page. Any log-in details entered on the fake sites are captured and then used to access email inboxes and look for messages that contain passwords to corporate Twitter accounts. As well as sending out messages to trick people into handing over details, the hackers have also defaced websites and tried to knock sites offline.",The Twitter feed of satire website the Onion has fallen victim to hackers from the Syrian Electronic Army.
"China's CCTV broadcast a strongly critical story in which experts suggested it was being used to grab data about Chinese citizens. The report comes only days after China banned the use of Windows 8 on many government computers. Separately, other Chinese media firms called for tech firms that aided US spying to face ""severe punishment"". US monitoring In the story Prof Yang Min of Fudan University was quoted as saying that Windows 8 posed a ""big challenge"" to the nation's cybersecurity efforts, ""Microsoft would no longer open its Windows 8 source code to the Chinese government,"" he said. ""However the security scheme of the Windows 8 operating system is designed to provide better access for Microsoft to users' database."" The report also suggested that Windows 8 was one of the methods the NSA was using to spirit data out of the country. China has been a consistent critic of the wide-ranging surveillance programme carried out by the NSA. ""Your identity, account, contact book, phone numbers, all this data can be put together for big data analysis,"" said Ni Guangnan, a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering. ""The data might be a good way for the US to monitor other countries,"" he added. In late May, China issued a notice which stopped Windows 8 machines being procured for government departments. The ban was apparently imposed because of a decree about energy-saving devices. However, many media reports said it was brought in because of fears over the security of the operating system. Microsoft told CCTV that it was ""actively co-operating"" with the Chinese government on a review of its products to allay fears about what was being done with user data. Many US tech companies were also criticised in the Chinese media for the help they have given to the NSA surveillance programme. Yahoo, Cisco, Facebook, Apple, Google and others were described as ""pawns"" of the US government that had aided attempts to spy on Chinese citizens and steal secrets. All should be punished for their co-operation, said editorials in state-backed media.",Microsoft's Windows 8 has been branded a threat to China's cybersecurity in a state-backed news report.
"By Zoe ThomasTechnology reporter The push comes as a representative from the WHO travelled to Silicon Valley to speak directly to tech firms about the spread of false information. The WHO has labelled the spread of fake news on the outbreak an ""infodemic"". Over 1,000 people have died as a result of the outbreak, which began in central China but has spread globally. Andrew Pattison, digital business solutions manager, for the WHO said false information was ""spreading faster than the virus"". Bogus claims that the virus was spread by eating bat soup or could be cured by garlic have already swept the web. 'Not based on science' Mr Pattison spoke on Thursday to a meeting of tech companies hosted at Facebook's headquarters in Mountain View California. Other firms in attendance included Google, Apple, Airbnb, Lyft, Uber and Salesforce. Earlier in the week, he held talks with Amazon, at the e-commerce giant's headquarters in Seattle. Since the outbreak of the coronavirus was labelled a public health emergency, books on the disease - which Mr Pattison said were not ""based on science"" - have been popping up for sale on the e-retailer. The WHO is also concerned that when users search for the term coronavirus on Amazon, listings for face masks and vitamin C boosters come up. Vitamin C has been listed as one of the fake cures for coronavirus. Social media firms have already taken some steps to remove false claims and promote accurate information. Facebook, Twitter, Youtube and TikTok are already directing users that search for coronavirus on their sites to the WHO or local health organisations. People searching on Google's search engines, meanwhile, are shown news and safety tips. Facebook has said it will use its existing network of third-party fact-checkers to debunk false claims. Mr Pattison said this was an opportunity for these firms to rethink how they addressed misinformation. ""I think what would be very exciting is to see this emergency changed into a long-term sustainable model, where we can have responsible content on these platforms."" The WHO has faced criticism of its own for the way it has tried to manage the crisis.",The World Health Organization (WHO) is urging tech companies to take tougher action to battle fake news on the coronavirus.
"The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) said the move would help ""promote the healthy and orderly development of the mobile internet"". Most smartphones in the country run Android, but Google does not operate its Play Store locally, meaning users go elsewhere to add software. A report last year linked this to the spread of malware. Cheetah Mobile Security - a Beijing-based firm - reported that more than 1.4 million Chinese users' mobile devices had been struck by infections as of January 2016, making it the worst afflicted nation. India and Indonesia were in second and third place. ""[A] reason these countries have become the worst-hit ones is that third party app markets are prevailing in these areas, and most of these third party app markets have been contaminated by malware due to weak monitoring,"" it said. CAC said the register was also intended to tackle the publication of ""illegal information"". This follows previous efforts to censor what appears online, including a recent demand that Apple remove the New York Times from the Chinese version of its iOS App Store. The US newspaper was the first to report the watchdog's move outside of China itself. Because of the Play store's absence, Android users in China typically go to stores operated by local tech giants including Tencent, Xiaomi, Baidu and Huawei. However, the Japanese cybersecurity firm Trend Micro has noted that some Chinese citizens also go to less secure stores specifically to find apps that are unavailable elsewhere. CAC's notice does not specify what steps it will take to ensure all marketplaces register themselves and supervise their contents to its liking. But since there are other ways to make handsets ""sideload"" software, one expert suggested the effort could have unintended consequences. ""If you turn off some of the settings you can bypass the app stores and install software from elsewhere,"" commented Dr Steven Murdoch from University College London. ""And that creates a security problem."" Analysis: Dong Le, BBC Chinese Service The move fits into a broader picture of the government stepping up control over the flow of information on the internet. In announcing the news, the authorities have acknowledged that mobile apps - like internet websites - have become a major carrier of information, and present a challenge to China's internet police. Many of the homegrown mobile apps are believed to contain security loopholes. But Chinese authorities are clearly worried that they may offer a way to circumvent its Great Firewall to enable their users to access websites and information that are deemed subversive.",China's internet regulator has ordered mobile app stores to register themselves with it immediately.
"Cryptography was once controlled by the state and deployed only for military and diplomatic ends. But in the 1970s, cryptographer Whitfield Diffie devised a system which took encryption keys away from the state and marked the start of the so-called ""Crypto Wars"". Whitfield Diffie and three other experts spoke to the BBC World Service Inquiry programme about the tensions at the heart of the spat between Apple and the FBI. Whitfield Diffie: The revolution begins In 1975, cryptographer Whitfield Diffie devised ""public key cryptography"", which revolutionised encryption. ""The basic techniques we used until public key cryptography come from around 1500 in the western world, and were known from about 800 in the Middle East. ""They are basically arithmetic. Not ordinary integer arithmetic, but something like clock arithmetic - it's 11 o'clock and you wait three hours and you get 2 o'clock - and table lookups. What's the 5th element in the table? What's the 20th element? ""The trouble is you can't do them very well without some kind of mechanical computation. A human being can't do enough of those calculations to produce a secure system without making too many mistakes. ""Before what we did, you could not have supported cryptography outside a fairly integrated organisation. If you look at the US Department of Defense, it's very large, but very centralised; everybody knows the chain of command. ""They can have a trusted entity run by the National Security Agency (NSA) to manage the keys [used by the military and government]. If you were in the military, and it was part of your assignment to talk to somebody securely in another part of the military, they would supply you with a key, and every morning you come out and put one in your teletype machine or phone or whatever. ""But the internet is not just meant for friends to talk to friends, it's for everybody to talk to everybody. Until you have public key cryptography you have no way of arranging the keys on demand at a moment's notice for these secure communications. ""That's what browsers do with websites all the time. Amazon, eBay, all of the merchants on the internet encrypt at least some of the traffic you have with them, at the very least the payment portion of it. ""[At the time] the NSA reacted like any other enterprise that has had a monopoly in a market for a long period of time. Suddenly somebody was treading on its turf, and it made several attempts to recapture its market."" Susan Landau: Crypto Wars Susan Landau is professor of Cyber Security Policy at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. ""Public-key cryptography was mathematically elegant and also quite elementary. That's what made it so powerful and so wonderful. ""The NSA said 'Wait a minute: this work should be classified.' They had been accustomed to being the only place that cryptography was done. They didn't want a competitor developing algorithms that maybe they would have trouble breaking into. They wanted to hold the keys to the kingdom. ""There was a big fight between the academic and industry research community and the NSA. But it was settled fairly amicably, fairly quickly. The next problem was who would control the development of cryptography standards for the US government. ""The NSA does this for military and diplomatic communications, but there's a vast need for cryptography for civilian agencies such as health and human services, education, agriculture. The National Bureau of Standards had been doing this in the 1970s but in the 1980s the NSA began pushing in this direction. ""Congress, who had always looked more favourably on the civilian side, put the National Institute of Standards and Technology in charge. ""But the law also included this little thing about three people from NSA approving certain things. They exercised tremendous control, and kept blocking standards that were more friendly to the commercial sector. That battle went on between 1987 until the mid 1990s. It was quite ugly. ""Another battle was over the clipper chip. Clipper was a very hard algorithm with a secure key, but the key was split and was to be shared with agencies of the federal government. The idea was [that] a business person travelling overseas would be able to use a clipper-enabled phone and talk securely with the office back at home. ""But if you're doing something illegal the US government will be able to decrypt easily, because the keys are held by its agencies. ""It was a complete flop. Outside the US, no one wanted it. Inside the US, no one bought it. It was a total failure. ""The controls on cryptography in the 1990s were very odd because they were controls on an export. If you wanted to export a computer or communications device with cryptography, you needed an export licence from the US government. ""Much of the time you would get 'We're looking at it, we'll get back to you.' Of course, when you're selling high tech, you don't need a delay of two months, [so] you decide not to have strong encryption within the device - you put in something very weak that the US government will allow to go without a licence. The effect was to not have strong encryption domestically as well as abroad. ""In 2000, the US government loosened the controls on export of devices with strong encryption; it looked as if the private sector won the battle."" Alan Woodward: Going dark Alan Woodward is an expert in signals intelligence, intelligence gathered from communications, who has worked for the UK government in various roles. ""Suppose you got intelligence that people appeared to be mobilising their military forces. You'd need to know whether that was a prelude to war, or just an exercise. One of the ways to do that was by analysing the signals and communications traffic going around on the other side. ""In the early 2000s, it got harder. Previously they'd had the ability to decrypt things that were weakly encrypted. You could throw a super computer at the problem and try all the possible keys until you unlock the message. ""You just physically couldn't do that for the number of encrypted messages that were starting to pile up. But also, the forms of encryption were becoming stronger. The encryption that was being used by governments themselves back in the 1970s was called the Data Encryption Standard. With a modern PC, you can break that in a matter of seconds. That kind of evolution in encryption and decryption has been going on ever since. ""It got worse because there were various other forms of technology that were based on encryption, where you were able to remain anonymous, completely hidden. There's a thing called the Tor network which causes security agencies a great deal of trouble, because you don't even know where that person is based, never mind who they're communicating with. ""Governments recognised that there wasn't a lot you could do about this technically or from a policy perspective. It's out there. So what you have to do is be able to get at it before it is encrypted or after it's decrypted. ""They recognised that they needed to work more closely with the technology providers because they were the ones that owned the infrastructure that was being used. They were the ones running it; it was no longer governments and state telecommunications companies. ""They had very good relationships. Microsoft produced a suite of software called Cofee (Computer Online Forensic Evidence Extractor), which is only given to government and Law Enforcement Agencies. It's a forensic tool that allows you to analyse Windows systems. ""You used to be able to go along to Apple and they could unlock the phone. With messaging services it was possible for governments with the right authorisation to go along and sit in the middle of the conversation and look at the messages in a non-encrypted form. ""All of that changed when Edward Snowden got his leaks out."" Jeff Larson: The Snowden Effect Jeff Larson is a reporter at New York investigative newsroom ProPublica. It worked with the Guardian newspaper on the sensitive material leaked by Edward Snowden from the US National Security Agency in 2013. ""I had seen something in the Snowden tranche of documents that made me suspicious that the NSA and GCHQ had been working behind the scenes to crack encryption that powers internet technologies. ""When you log into your bank or Twitter or Facebook, your web browser talks to those servers over what's known as TLS, which is an encryption layer that protects the confidentiality of that traffic. ""The intelligence agencies - not only NSA and GCHQ, but Canada and Australia and New Zealand- had spent 10 years and untold billions of dollars trying to break these fundamental encryption technologies. ""They honed things, like their power with super computers, but they were also able to mount a programme of inserting back doors into cryptographic software, and - perhaps a bit more troubling - the NSA launched a covert campaign to influence the very standards that programmers rely on to create encryption. ""So standards bodies write up 'here's how encryption works, here's how you implement it in your software', and the NSA was actually working against that effort. ""Ever since [the Snowden revelations were published in] 2013, there's been quite a movement to further encrypt the internet. ""I think there's been an awakening on the part of private companies that it is important to their users to keep [their data] confidential and secret. ""Apple saw these revelations about the overreach of intelligence services and law enforcement services, and created a phone that was harder to crack because they wanted to increase the security of their users. I do believe that. ""The Apple case is very hard. I see the arguments on both sides. I see the fact that the FBI wants access to this information, and I also see Apple's need to protect its customers' privacy. ""I hope that we come to a conclusion that is more open and transparent. What I would say is I like that this fight is happening in public so that we can have debates like this."" The Inquiry is broadcast on the BBC World Service on Tuesdays from 12:05 GMT. Listen online or download the podcast.",The clash between Apple and the FBI over whether the company should provide access to encrypted data on a locked iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino attackers highlights debates about privacy and data security which have raged for decades.
"The Imposter Buster bot automatically replied to tweets posted by fake accounts, to warn other people. However, Twitter suspended the bot after a large number of ""spam complaints"" were filed against it, according to the New York Times. ""Impostor Buster was doing Twitter's job for it,"" said writer Yair Rosenberg. Impersonator trolls Mr Rosenberg had identified that online trolls were forging false identities by stealing photographs of Jews and Muslims wearing religious clothes. The trolls presented themselves on Twitter as religious figures with biographies such as ""fighting anti-Semitism"" and ""enemy of the right wing"". However, they would join in conversations and post messages such as ""not all Nazis were bad"" and ""If Theresa May evicted the UK's Muslims, I would commission a statue in her honour"". Mr Rosenberg described the accounts as ""disturbingly effective"" as it would not be immediately obvious to spectators that the profiles were fake. Imposter Buster Working with a volunteer software developer, Mr Rosenberg developed a bot that would reply to tweets posted by the fake accounts. ""Using a crowd-sourced database of impersonator accounts, carefully curated by us to avoid any false positives, the bot patrolled Twitter and interjected whenever impostors tried to insinuate themselves into a discussion,"" he explained. He said the bot had proved popular with Twitter users - but also attracted the attention of the trolls it was designed to expose. ""They started mass-reporting it to Twitter for 'harassment',"" he said. ""Just as they duplicitously cast themselves as minorities, they disingenuously recast our response to their ongoing abuse as harassment."" Suspended On Wednesday, Mr Rosenberg said Twitter had banned the bot. ""The company's justifications were both entirely accurate and utterly absurd,"" he wrote. In his article, he said the bot had been banned because it had posted ""high volumes"" of ""duplicative content"". Twitter had also received a ""large number of spam complaints"", which Mr Rosenberg said had probably been submitted by the online trolls. Many people were disappointed that the site had chosen to ban the Imposter Buster. ""Utterly and completely outrageous,"" said journalist Yascha Mounk. ""I'm strongly against censorship of social media. But if companies like Twitter continue to be this infuriatingly incompetent (or worse), the tide will turn against them fast."" Twitter has struggled to tackle harassment and abuse on the platform, and has been criticised for struggling to enforce its own rules consistently. In December, it expanded what it classed as hateful and harmful behaviour and said it would enforce stricter rules. The company has not yet responded to the BBC's request for comment.",Twitter has shut down a crowd-sourced effort to expose fake accounts posting racist messages on the social network.
"Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent@BBCRoryCJon Twitter That is what British firm Babylon is promising, and to build this perfect doctor it is using machine learning. It is a technique which is suddenly transforming many aspects of our lives. Babylon is announcing an investment of £50m to build what it claims will be the world's most advanced artificial intelligence healthcare platform. Its chief executive Ali Parsa says it will put expert health advice in the hands of smartphone users around the world. ""Our scientists have little doubt that our AI will soon diagnose and predict personal health better than doctors,"" he says. But he is quick to stress that this will be a help to doctors, rather than a replacement: ""No machine can put its hand on your shoulder and say trust me I'm going to take care of you."" Babylon provides a service where patients can see a (human) GP via their smartphone. Its team of computer scientists and doctors has also built an NHS 111 app which allows some patients in North London to describe their symptoms and then be advised on whether to book an appointment with their GP or take other steps. Competitive edge The company is building on the data it has gathered to help its system teach itself to become expert at diagnosing. In effect the machine is going through medical school, armed with vast amounts of data, and learning more every time it interacts with a patient. ""Considering the machine is interacting with thousands of patients a day, the speed at which it is learning is significantly higher than any one individual,"" says Dr Parsa.""We're trying to give the machine a significant amount of data, much more than any human brain can keep, It teaches itself more and more."" Today's report from the Royal Society says the UK has a competitive edge in machine learning, a technique first described decades ago, but which has made rapid progress in recent years ago thanks to greater processing power and access to greater stores of data. Examples of the technique include Google DeepMind's AlphaGo, which taught itself to beat a champion of the complex game of Go after playing thousands of games against itself. It can also be seen in the rapid improvement in the ability of computers to understand the human voice, to translate from one language to another - and to tell the difference between a dog and a cat. Professor Peter Donnelly, who chaired the panel which spent eighteen months studying machine learning, sees healthcare as one area that could be transformed next: ""Analysing complex images and combining information from many sources to help doctors make decisions on diagnosis and treatment will become more and more important."" Excitement - and concern He says education could be another fruitful area, with machines taking on routine tasks like marking and also producing personalised lessons for individual pupils. The report warns that action will be needed to give the UK the skills and the investment needed to stay at the forefront of the technology and make sure that everyone across society benefits. The Royal Society commissioned Ipsos Mori to survey public opinion about machine learning - unsurprisingly only 9% of those questioned had heard of it. But when it was explained that it helped power voice assistants on phones or label photos on Facebook the vast majority said they had used it. There was also a mixture of excitement about the potential - and concern about possible harmful effects. These included accidents involving self-driving cars, the threat to jobs, and the loss of human contact as the machines get better at fulfilling our every need. Which brings us back to Babylon's plan to put a doctor in our smartphones. Healthcare, not just in the UK but in much poorer parts of the world, could be made much more widely available and effective by machine learning. But persuading patients to talk to a machine - and trust it with their most sensitive information - may take a long time","Imagine a doctor you could consult at any time, describing your symptoms and then getting a speedy and accurate diagnosis - all in a smartphone app."
"By Dave LeeTechnology reporter, BBC News Hunter Moore was found to have made false claims about the chief executive of an anti-bullying website. Mr Moore used Twitter to falsely claim James McGibney was a paedophile who possessed child pornography. Mr Moore's website used to post naked images of people without their permission. He closed it in 2012. At the time, the site's closure seemed a sudden and dramatic change of heart - Mr Moore sold the domain, IsAnyoneUp.com, to Mr McGibney's website Bullyville.com. ""Back in April of this year, I convinced Hunter to shut down his now infamous ""IsAnyoneUp.com"" revenge porn website for a nominal fee,"" wrote Mr McGibney in a blog post about the recent lawsuit. ""Hunter was so convincing that he was going to turn over a new leaf and be an advocate against bullying, especially under-age bullying. ""Within 72 hours of that transaction being complete, Hunter was on Twitter cyberbullying kids worse than ever before. ""Telling kids that they should 'kill themselves' using vulgar, racist language and advocating more violence and revenge."" Las Vegas court documents filed on Friday, and reported on by Ars Technica, showed Mr Moore did not contest the charges. Mr Moore used his Twitter account, which has almost 150,000 followers, to make several derogatory comments about Mr McGibney. Mr Moore encouraged others to post the claims in return for free clothing - Mr McGibney said he would be taking action against those that did so. ""'Internet tough guys' are also legally accountable for their actions,"" Mr McGibney wrote. ""Hunter and some of his followers now realise this, along with their parents since some of his followers appear to be under the age of 18."" The settlement amount was said to be a ""conservative estimate"" of reputational damage caused by Mr Moore's comments. The money would donated to women's shelters across the US, Mr McGibney added. Direct action Other sites, heavily inspired by Mr Moore's, carry out a similar purpose of posting naked images, often together with the victim's social-media profiles. Mr Moore, and others like him, have typically been able to avoid direct action thanks to complex rules regarding uploading such images. Typically, in cases where images are removed, it is because of breaches of copyright rather than because of the content of the photographs. In an interview with the BBC last year, Mr Moore said of his site: ""People obviously want it, and I'm going to give the people what they want. ""I'm just a businessman. ""I just monetise people's mistakes that they made and it's kind of a shady business. But if it wasn't me, somebody else was going to do it. All I did was really perfected the way to monetise people's naked pictures."" He has made repeated claims that he would relaunch his website - but this has not materialised, in part due to action by hacktivist collective Anonymous, who targeted the planned site towards the end of last year. In addition to the defamation claim, Mr McGibney has launched a class action lawsuit against the site, and has invited users to come forward to share their complaints. ""We're doing this mostly for the completely powerless, under-age women who were verbally harassed after Hunter posted their completely naked, unedited photos on his site. ""We'll soon be launching a brand new site for IsAnyoneUp.com that not only shows the history and eventual dismantling of this disturbing website, but also brings valuable information to people who have been wronged by similar behaviour."" Mr Moore has yet to comment on the court order. Lawyer Marc Randazza, who represented Mr McGibney in the case, has said he will help Las Vegas-based revenge porn victims for no charge. In a blog post, he wrote: ""If anyone out there has been scammed by these crooks, contact me.""","The founder of a so-called ""revenge porn"" website has been ordered to pay $250,000 (£170,000) in damages for defamation."
"By Leo KelionTechnology reporter, BBC News The operating system claims 20 million people use it a day. Not an insignificant number, but still a drop in the ocean compared to Microsoft's Windows or Apple's OS X. Even so, lead designer and one-time astronaut Mark Shuttleworth hopes that last week's major upgrade to the Linux-based project will produce an outsized splash and increase the size of its somewhat divergent customer-base. ""In terms of our user, they would split into two sorts of camps,"" he says. ""One, not very tech savvy, that has an old PC lying around and Windows is getting difficult because of the computer's age or viruses, and Ubuntu gives them a nice basic all-purpose PC with a great web experience. ""The other group tends to be the next generation of tech entrepreneurs - people who are passionate about technology and want to do amazing things with it."" Mr Shuttleworth counts Wikipedia and Facebook's Instagram photo app among his clients. A third class of users is also attracted to the system - public bodies looking to cut their IT bills. The Dutch ministry of defence, part of France's police force and schools across the south of Spain have all opted to switch thousands of their PCs to the software. Type to control Ubuntu is able to offer itself as a free download thanks to coders across the world volunteering to develop the open-source project. Mr Shuttleworth's London-based company, Canonical, manages and funds the endeavour and makes money back by offering support, training and online storage. The system may remain niche so long as it lacks native versions of big name software like Photoshop, iTunes and Microsoft Office - despite alternative products - but it may still shake up the wider industry thanks to efforts to incorporate innovative technologies. The adoption of a head-up display (HUD) in the upgrade is a case in point. It aims to replace increasingly overloaded point-and-click menu systems with a panel into which users type what they want the computer to do. The computer then tries to offer up a list of functions that match their request. ""The core idea is that instead of hunting for some functionality in a menu you can simply express what you want,"" Mr Shuttleworth says. ""You can say I want to send that to grandma, or I want to back this up. ""It's driven by the idea that search or expressing your intent has become really powerful. If Google can turn the whole internet into one page of likely results just based on the one sentence you give it, why can't we do that with your email or graphics application?"" Natural interfaces For now the innovation remains optional. The software designer admits it still needs ""a great deal of work"", but he adds that it is only one of many steps he hopes to take towards a more intuitive, multi-sensory experience. ""You could imagine having the device track your eyeballs so it knows what you are looking at - so you could look at a movie and say 'I want to watch that.' ""You can get away from the designer of the application having to provide a cumbersome way to express all the things you can do which you have to navigate, and just let you just say what you want to get done - whether that's by talking, pointing or by touch interface - all of these things have to come together to make it feel more human."" Delivering these ambitions will take years, perhaps decades. In the shorter term, Ubuntu's fans have been excited by a job posting which discussed creating a Ubuntu smartphone system. Mr Shuttleworth refuses to reveal any details, beyond hinting that it will be a closer relation to the firm's core product than some of its rivals' mobile systems are to their desktop equivalents. ""You know you wouldn't want to run Mac OS X nor Windows 8 on a phone,"" he says. ""Those companies have quite different sorts of interfaces. We think we have found a way to have a more harmonious portfolio... we will be judged on what we ship."" Pocket-sized PC The firm's smartphone efforts are also concentrated on ""Ubuntu for Android"" - an app that makes high-end phones act like a PC when docked with a monitor and keyboard, which is due out later this year. The firm suggests businesses could ultimately cut costs by only having to buy a single device for each of their employees. It is a radical proposition, and also a bit of a philosophical challenge. ""There are two counter-balancing forces - one force saying everyone should have fewer CPUs [central processing units] as their phone can replace other devices,"" says Mr Shuttleworth. ""But then you have exactly the opposite trend which is saying that anything that could have a screen can also have a brain, a memory and a personality - printers with touch-screens, desk phones that deliver your mail. And those are two completely contradictory forces. ""Holding those two opposing ideas in our head at the same time is what's really exciting."" Patent problem Other ambitions include the roll-out of the first Ubuntu powered television sets and perhaps support for mark two of the Raspberry Pi stripped-back computer, whenever it launches. ""We just couldn't connect all the dots in the first version... I'd be delighted if a future version worked with us,"" Mr Shuttleworth adds. But as his firm rushes to release new innovations, one major cloud looms: the threat of a patent dispute. Although Canonical has avoided becoming involved in one of the rising number of lawsuits sucking up time and brainpower at its competitors, it is an ever-present concern. ""We know that we are sort of dancing naked through a minefield and there are much bigger institutions driving tanks through,"" Mr Shuttleworth says. ""It's basically impossible to ship any kind of working software without potentially trampling on some patent somewhere in the world, and it's completely impossible to do anything to prevent that. ""The patents system is being used to slow down a lot of healthy competition and that's a real problem. I think that the countries that have essentially figured that out and put hard limits on what you can patent will in fact do better.""","Free of charge, free of viruses and designed to outpace its rivals on low-end systems - Ubuntu has some obvious advantages."
"By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter It is suing chipmaker Qualcomm, claiming it breached UK competition law by taking advantage of its dominance in the patent licensing and chip markets. Which? alleges that it charged inflated fees to manufacturers, which were then passed on to consumers in the form of higher smartphone prices. Qualcomm said the case had ""no basis"". ""As the plaintiffs are well aware, their claims were effectively put to rest last summer by a unanimous panel of judges at the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in the United States,"" a spokesman told the BBC. Which? is seeking damages for all affected Apple and Samsung smartphones purchased since 1 October 2015. It estimates individuals could be entitled to up to £30 compensation each, depending on the type of smartphone they bought. Anabel Hoult, chief executive of Which? said: ""We believe Qualcomm's practices are anti-competitive and have so far taken around £480m from consumers' pockets - this needs to stop. ""We are sending a clear warning that if companies like Qualcomm indulge in manipulative practices which harm consumers, Which? is prepared to take action."" It has filed its legal claim with the Competition Appeal Tribunal, which will decide if it can go ahead. Qualcomm, one of the world's biggest producers of mobile phone chips, has faced a series of allegations about anti-competitive behaviour. In 2018, the European Commission fined the firm €997m (£858m) for violating competition laws in a series of deals it made with Apple. And in 2019, it issued another €242m fine for abusing its dominant position in the 3G chipset market, following a four-year investigation. Qualcomm is appealing against both findings. The Federal Trade Commission in the United States also sued the firm for unfair practices in the way it licensed its technology back in 2017, but had its case dismissed last year.",About 29 million people in the UK may be entitled to compensation of up to £30 each if a legal claim from watchdog Which? is successful.
"The change meant moving through a feed had to be done by swiping horizontally rather than vertically. Almost as soon as the change was made, users took to Twitter to complain and demand the return of the familiar up-and-down scrolling method. The unwelcome update - which was likened to Tinder - was live for about an hour before it was rolled back. In a tweet, Instagram's head of product Adam Mosseri said: ""Sorry about that, this was supposed to be a very small test but we went broader than we anticipated."" The change trended under the #instagramupdate hashtag on Twitter, accompanied by mostly negative comments. Many asked who had thought changing the scrolling direction would be a good idea. Several called on co-founders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger - who quit earlier this year - to return. Some wondered if it was a way to stop people just scrolling endlessly through updates by making them tap and examine posts before moving on. Instagram user Elise Michelle called it: ""By far the worst update in Instagram history."" Soon after the backlash, Mr Mosseri tweeted that the change had been ""rolled back"". He added: ""If you're still seeing it you can simply restart your app and you should be good to go.""",Instagram has apologised after a test feature was accidentally rolled out to millions of people using its app.
"Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News@gordoncoreraon Twitter It also flagged that a vulnerability ""of national significance"" had occurred in 2019 but been fixed before it could be exploited. The assessment was given by an oversight board, chaired by a member of the cyber-spy agency GCHQ. It could influence other nations weighing up use of Huawei's kit. The report said that GCHQ's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) had seen no evidence that Huawei had made a significant shift in its approach to the matter. And it added that while some improvements had been made, it had no confidence they were sustainable. As a result, it concluded, the board could only provide ""limited assurance that all risks to UK national security"" could be mitigated in the long-term. In July, the government announced that due to US sanctions Huawei would eventually be excluded from the new 5G telecoms network by 2027, but the Chinese company can continue to play a role in older mobile phone networks and fixed broadband. The US has argued that using Huawei's equipment creates a risk of the Chinese state carrying out espionage or sabotage, something the company has always denied. Despite the criticisms, British security officials say they can manage the current risks posed by using Huawei's existing kit, and they do not believe the defects they have found are a result of Chinese state interference. Huawei has responded saying the report highlights its commitment to openness and transparency. ""The report acknowledges that while our software transformation process is in its infancy, we have made some progress in improving our software engineering capabilities,"" a spokesman said. Although the company now has limited prospects in the UK, it is still hoping to sell its 5G kits to other parts of Europe. Earlier this week, the chief of its Italian business suggested that other countries could carry out detailed inspections of their own to help overcome security concerns. ""We will open our insides, we are available to be vivisected to respond to all of this political pressure,"" said Luigi De Vecchis. However, the Financial Times has reported that Germany is set to be next to ban local networks from using the firm's 5G products. One expert said setting up an operation like HSEC required a state to provide considerable resources, and offered no guarantee of success. ""Even if Huawei passes the technical evaluation, which we see from today's report is not certain, they may yet be blocked at the political level,"" said Emily Taylor, editor of the Journal of Cyber Policy. Delayed findings Huawei equipment has been used in the UK for a decade and a half. Since 2010, a special Huawei Cyber Security Evaluation Centre (HCSEC), based in Banbury, has been tasked with checking its telecoms infrastructure products. An oversight board then examines the work of HCSEC and reports to the UK's National Security Advisor annually, although the latest report covering 2019 was delayed because of the coronavirus pandemic. Last year, the report raised serious concerns about standard of Huawei's equipment and software, and there is no major change in the latest assessment. In 2018, Huawei committed to a $2bn (£1.5bn) five-year plan to improve its software engineering processes in response to previous criticism. But the new report complains that Huawei has yet to convince that it can complete the effort on time, and adds that ""unless a detailed and satisfactory plan has been provided, it is not possible to offer any degree of confidence that the identified problems can be addressed by Huawei"". In particular it highlighted ""poor coding practices"" and said there was a ""range of evidence"" employees were not following Huawei's own guidelines. Huawei argues it is still in the early stages of the plan and real improvements will only be reflected in future reports. Broadband flaw The report adds the amount of vulnerabilities reported in 2019 were ""significantly beyond"" the number found in 2018, but says this is partly due to the increasing effectiveness of the checks rather than an overall decline in standards. But it highlights one vulnerability of ""national significance"" in 2019, which required extraordinary measures to fix. The BBC has learned this was related to broadband - but officials do not believe anyone exploited the flaw. The report covers 2019, and so does not address the period when the US imposed new sanctions affecting Huawei. Those sanctions technically affect HCSEC itself, since it is part of Huawei, and will require changes in its organisational structure. Huawei is also currently building an alternative supply chain for crucial technology affected by the sanctions. The report comes a day after NCSC's ex-chief explained why the UK had to be alert to the risks of using Huawei's kit in unusually plain language. ""We have to plan on the basis that at some point, Huawei could be made subservient operationally to the Chinese state,"" Ciaran Martin told a committee of MPs. ""You always have to have in mind a scenario where every bit of involvement of Huawei was turned against the UK. ""And you don't make that assumption for Nokia, you don't make that assumption for Ericsson."" Additional reporting by Leo Kelion","Huawei has failed to adequately tackle security flaws in equipment used in the UK's telecoms networks despite previous complaints, an official report says."

"Dave LeeNorth America technology reporter But the remaining members have insisted it’s full steam ahead. The 21 founding companies in the Libra Association - down from 28 when the project was first announced - met for the first time in Geneva on Monday. A spokesman told the BBC he believed the currency was still on track to launch next year. But, he added, it would only do so if suitable regulatory approval had been granted. It comes after a stern warning from the G7 group of nations that Libra risked disrupting the global financial order. That concern followed a letter to payments providers from US senators Brian Schatz and Sherrod Brown, sent on 8 October, that threatened “a high level of scrutiny from regulators not only on Libra-related payment activities, but on all payment activities”. Libra Association spokesman Dante Disparte criticised the senators, telling the BBC the letter “stifles private market innovation”. “At some level it confounds the regulatory process and the law-making process of free market economies,” Mr Disparte said in a phone call on Monday. The interference created a “problematic precedent for the state of private sector innovation”, he added. Another drop-out Visa, Mastercard, Stripe, eBay, PayPal and Mercado Pago were the six firms that dropped out ahead of Monday’s meeting. On Monday morning, it was revealed that Booking Holdings - the firm behind Booking.com - had also pulled out. The remaining 21 members all confirmed their commitment to the project at the Geneva meeting. Among them are rideshare firms Uber and Lyft, prominent venture capital firms Andreessen Horowitz and Union Square Ventures, music streaming service Spotify, and the sales and services arm of telecoms company Vodafone. Netherlands-based PayU is the only remaining member operating in the online payments processing sector. “We believe that the design of the Libra ecosystem has the potential to address a number of societal needs,” a PayU spokesperson said, in a statement sent out by the Libra Association. Search on for CEO Of the 21 companies, representatives from five of the firms were elected to form the Libra Association’s board, with Facebook’s David Marcus among them. Bertrand Perez, a former senior director at PayPal, was appointed chief operating officer and interim managing director. The board would soon set up a search committee to appoint a permanent chief executive, Mr Disparte said. He added that many more firms were interested in joining the association. “More than 1,500 organisations have expressed an interest in joining this effort,” Mr Disparte said. “Even though aspects of that have been difficult in the last few months.” In response to mounting concerns, Facebook’s chief executive Mark Zuckerberg has been called to appear before a congressional panel on 23 October to discuss Libra, and likely other issues involving his firm. _____ Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC Do you have more information about this or any other technology story?

"By Zoe Kleinman and Leo KelionTechnology reporters And hot on its heels will be Cyber Monday, a phrase coined back in 2005 when online shopping needed promotion, but is increasingly becoming less relevant. There will be bargains to be had but shoppers need to keep their wits about them. Here are some top tips. Be realistic You're unlikely to get 50% off the latest iPhone. Newer products are still going to sell well at their original price so there is less incentive for firms to put them on offer - especially tech devices. Consumer website Which? also suggests being cautious about apparently amazing offers on unknown brands. It found that one in five Black Friday shoppers did not read any reviews of the products they bought and advised people to do their research and be wary of unusual brands. Watch out too for unfamiliar stores that significantly undercut their rivals. Trustpilot and Reviews.co.uk are two popular sites where you can draw on past customers' experiences. In addition, it can be worth double-checking whether the retailer is based outside the EU as that might signal they are selling ""grey market"" items that the manufacturer's regional division will not fix or replace if something goes wrong. Sending a camera or phone back overseas for repair could easily wipe out any savings you might make. Bargain checking If you do spot a good deal, bear in mind that some stores change their prices several times a day, so it may not last. In some cases you can guard against this by sticking the product in your shopping cart before double-checking it's a bargain by searching elsewhere. If the store puts the price up in the meantime, you should still be able to complete the deal at the earlier advertised cost. And if it's gone down, you can empty the basket and then add the product back in again to take advantage of the change. There are also several websites, apps and browser plug-ins that can aid you on your shopping quest. One of the most famous is camelcamelcamel, which allows you to see a product's historic prices on Amazon and set up alerts to tell you if it drops to a desired price point. Keepa offers a similar service. You have to log in to use it, but it offers simple ways to check if prices are cheaper on eBay as well as providing an opportunity to dive deeper into the data. If you prefer Argos to the US retail giants, you should try PriceHistory instead. It lists past prices for items sold by the UK chain rather than drawing you charts, but has a clear user interface and also highlights the biggest reductions of the day by product category. Voucher codes can also help cut prices further. There's plenty of sites to find them, but you can also speed up the process by adding an extension such as Pouch or PriceBlink, which automatically flag relevant codes for the online store you are currently visiting. Alternatively, Honey promises to carry out a voucher-scan of its own at checkout and automatically fills in the best code for you if one is available. In addition, you can draw on other people's bargain-spotting skills by checking out HotUKDeals, LatestDeals.co.uk and the MoneySavingExpert forums - all of which offer finds and comments submitted by other members of the public. And you could always abandon your basket, by filling it and then not checking out. Sometimes retailers entice you to finish the purchase by offering further discounts. Stay secure Beware of email deals that sound too good to be true if you just click that link - and check website addresses very carefully. ""Making a website look identical to a well-known retail brand is horribly easy,"" says Prof Alan Woodward from Surrey University. ""Try not to use a link in an email but rather go to the web address you know."" He also advises keeping an eye on your statements in the aftermath of the sales to make sure nobody else has helped themselves to your card details. Fashion savvy Lots of high street shops are offering deals on chothes and again price comparison websites can help find the cheapest prices. If buying online, users can opt to collect items from stores to save a delivery charge and also take advantage of cashback sites such as Quidco.com which offers a £15 bonus when shopping via it at over 4,500 brands. Remember your rights If you buy anything online you have 14 days to change your mind and get a complete refund, says Sarah Pennells, editor of the consumer finance website Savvy Woman. ""You may have to pay to return the item, but if the retailer doesn't tell you whether or not you'll have to pay return postage, it's free,"" she says. Ms Pennells also advises paying on a credit card for purchases worth more than £100 (and less than £30,000) as you are better protected if the firm goes bust or you don't receive your item, than you would be if you paid by debit card.",Black Friday is upon us and this year many retailers have extended their deals for the whole week.
"Taimoor Raza was convicted after allegedly posting remarks about the Prophet Muhammad, his wives and companions within the site's comments. The public prosecutor involved said he believed it was the first time the death penalty had been awarded in a case related to social media. Human rights campaigners have expressed concern. Facebook itself has yet to comment on the case. The US firm previously announced in March that it was deploying a team to Pakistan to address the government's concerns about blasphemous content on its service, but added that it still wished to protect ""the privacy and rights"" of its members. Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has described blasphemy as being an ""unpardonable offence"". Religious debate Raza's case was heard by an anti-terrorism court in Bahawalpur - about 309 miles (498km) from the capital Islamabad. His defence lawyer said the 30-year-old had become involved in an argument about Islam on the social network with someone who had turned out to be a counter-terrorism official. The public prosecutor said the accused had been arrested after playing hate speech and blasphemous material from his phone at a bus stop, following which his handset had been confiscated and analysed. Raza will be able to appeal against the death penalty at Lahore High Court and then, if required, in Pakistan's Supreme Court. The Express Tribune, a local newspaper, reported that the verdict came days after a college professor was refused bail in another case involving accusations of blasphemy on social media in Pakistan. Amnesty International recently published a report critical of the country's blasphemy laws. Its Pakistan campaigner, Nadia Rahman, has called for Raza's immediate release. ""Convicting and sentencing someone to death for allegedly posting blasphemous material online is a violation of international human rights law and sets a dangerous precedent,"" she told the BBC. ""No one should be hauled before an anti-terrorism court or any other court solely for peacefully exercising their rights to freedom of expression and freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief online."" The developments come seven years after a Pakistan court temporarily blocked local access to Facebook after the social network was used to promote a contest to draw images of Prophet Muhammad - an act considered to be offensive by many Muslims. Analysis - Tahir Imran, BBC Urdu social media editor This is a dramatic time for Pakistani social media. Once considered a platform where people could express themselves freely, it is now a place where people worry about the consequences of commenting. Instead of acting to restore confidence and safeguarding the masses' right to freedom of expression, the government has been busy making threats through TV and newspaper adverts. This is happening with a clear understanding about the gravity that accusations of blasphemy can have. There have been several incidents of vigilantes taking the law into their own hands after such claims. Human rights activists accuse the government of pushing through a controversial cyber-crimes law without addressing their concerns. In a country where fewer people have been convicted of blasphemy than have been killed after being accused of the offence, this ruling will not calm nerves. And increasingly people prefer to use chat apps and closed groups to post content so that their thoughts cannot be seen by the wider public.",A man accused of posting blasphemous content to Facebook has been sentenced to death by a court in Pakistan.
"By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor Issues include the update causing Nexus 7 tablets to run slowly and repeatedly crash, with several users complaining they had become ""unusable"". The code also appears to remove apps built with Adobe Air and then prevent them from being reinstalled. Adobe said it had not been aware of this ""critical"" bug before Tuesday and had escalated it with Google. A spokesman for the search firm was unable to comment at this time. 'Shockingly bad' Android 5.0 - also known as Lollipop - is described as a ""quantum leap forward"" by Google and has attracted several positive reviews, fuelling desire for the software. It revamps the system's user interface, offers greater control over notifications, and makes changes to the way the OS executes code, which Google said should mean fewer ""temporary glitches"" than before. At the moment, it is only available to a limited number of machines, because many network operators and device manufacturers have yet to complete their own tests. However, owners of Nexus-branded machines - which are sold by Google itself - can install the software by downloading it from the firm's website or, in the case of the Asus-made Nexus 7, accepting an over-the-air update. Nvidia, LG and Motorola have also released Android Lollipop updates for some of their handsets and tablets. Dozens of messages posted to Google's own forums suggest that owners of the 2012 version of the Nexus 7, in particular, are experiencing headaches. ""Some apps won't work and some crash. I wish I didn't install the update,"" wrote Kristen Sawyer. Another user, nicknamed StretchToo said: ""Chrome is dead, unusable, Firefox just about works, the keyboard takes over a minute to load, nearly works if you hunt and peck but dies if you try to swipe."" Some tablet owners have, however, suggested potential solutions to such problems. ""Updated and the Nexus is [so] shockingly bad it is basically unusable, lags just rotating the screen, every task takes 10 seconds to perform if it does it [at all],"" wrote Gary Looker. ""I've turned off Google Now, changed transitions to zero and limited it to two background apps maximum like the good people here suggested. ""I shouldn't have to do that, and many people won't know where to turn or who to listen to."" Escalating the issue Several Android Lollipop users have also highlighted compatibility problems with Air-based apps. Air allows developers to use Adobe's Flash and Dreamweaver tools to create software, and is particularly popular with indie video game makers. Examples of titles that use the tech include Machinarium, Hero Mages and Empire Four Kingdoms, while non-gaming examples include Instaweather Pro and Conqu. ""We were previously unaware of this bug and contrary to other reports, were not working with Google on a fix,"" wrote Adobe product manager Chris Campbell in response. ""However, we are working with Google on another self-signed certificate issue that is impacting in-app purchases. It's possible the two are related, but we do not have enough information at this time to determine one way or the other. ""That said, we'll be escalating this issue with Google immediately."" Reports elsewhere suggest some users are experiencing problems with text messages, the way contacts are managed, and wi-fi connectivity. 'Best to wait' Bugs in major software updates are not uncommon. Apple apologised in September after faults with iOS 8 caused some of its new iPhones to be unable to make and receive calls, and also restricted their Touch ID functionality. One expert said in general, there were benefits to waiting a few days after a release date before installing upgrades. ""With any software update it makes sense to watch and see if there are any teething problems,"" said Ian Fogg, from the IHS Technology consultancy. ""Consumers like it and benefit when their devices gain a new lease of life with new features - but they expect what they used to use to continue to work, and that can be tricky. ""What's striking about Android Lollipop is that it's reaching devices from more manufacturers, more more quickly than previous versions of Android. ""Motorola, LG and Nvidia have devices receiving Lollipop almost at the same time as Nexus devices. ""That has benefits to consumers who get it quicker... but of course makes it more complex for Google, which has to manage problems across a wider range of phones and tablets early on.""",Early adopters of Google's latest Android operating system are warning others of problems with the software.
"Dave LeeNorth America technology reporter It is the first time that the firm has published figures detailing the scale of efforts to enforce its rules. Facebook is developing artificial intelligence tools to support the work of its 15,000 human moderators. But the report suggest the software struggles to spot some types of abuse. For example, the algorithms only flagged 38% of identified hate speech posts over the period, meaning 62% were only addressed because users had reported them. By contrast, the firm said its tools spotted 99.5% of detected propaganda posted in support of Islamic State, Al-Qaeda and other affiliated groups, leaving only 0.5% to the public. The figures also reveal that Facebook believes users were more likely to have experienced graphic violence and adult nudity via its service over the January-to-March quarter than the prior three months. But it said it had yet to develop a way to judge if this was also true of hate speech and terrorist propaganda. ""As we learn about the right way to do this, we will improve the methodology,"" commented Facebook's head of product management, Guy Rosen. Violent spike Facebook broke down banned content into several categories: On the latter, the company estimates about 3% to 4% of all active users on Facebook are fake, and said it had taken 583 million fake accounts down between January and March. The figures indicate graphic violence spiked massively - up 183% between each of the two time periods in the report. It said that a mix of better detection technology and an escalation in the Syrian conflict might account for this. A total of 1.9 million pieces of extremist content were removed between January and March, a 73% rise on the previous quarter. That will make promising reading for governments, particularly in the US and UK, which have called on the company to stop the spread of material from groups such as Islamic State. ""They're taking the right steps to clearly define what is and what is not protected speech on their platform,"" said Brandie Nonnecke, from University of California, Berkeley's Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society. But, she added: ""Facebook has a huge job on its hands."" 'Screaming out of the closet' The complexity of that job emerges when considering hate speech, a category much more difficult to control via automation. The firm tackled 2.5 million examples in the most recent period, up 56% on the October-to-December months. Human moderators were involved in dealing with the bulk of these, but even they faced problems deciding what should stay and what should be deleted. ""There's nuance, there's context that technology just can't do yet,"" said Alex Schultz, the company's head of data analytics. ""So, in those cases we lean a lot still on our review team, which makes a final decision on what needs to come down."" To demonstrate this, Mr Schultz said words that would be considered slurs if used as part of a homophobic attack had different meaning when used by gay people themselves. So, deleting all posts using a certain term would be the wrong choice. ""But how do you know I'm gay if you're reviewing my profile?"" he asked. ""For me, I put it at the top of the profile - I've come screaming out of the closet, I am very openly gay. ""But that isn't true of everyone, and we can't know that. This is a very difficult problem."" Staggering samples In an attempt to discover what it may have missed, the social network carried out random sampling. It took an unspecified number of posts that had been viewed on Facebook, and made a note of how often a piece of content was in violation of its policies. The results were troubling. According to the sample, as many as 27 posts in every 10,000 contained some form of graphic violence. Given the 1.5 billion daily users of the service, that could means tens of millions of violent posts go unchecked every day. The same technique estimated between seven to nine posts in every 10,000 contained adult nudity or sexual content. The amount of terrorism-related material was too small to sample in this way, Mr Schultz said. And on hate speech, he said, the company lacked any ""reliable data"" on total volume. ""We can't currently measure how prevalent hate speech violations were on Facebook, because when we're asking our representatives to go and look, 'Is this hate speech, is this not?', it is very difficult to score that. ""We're making mistakes and we're trying to get better at measuring it."" 'Privilege payroll' But Dottie Lux, an event organiser in San Francisco, who campaigns against Facebook's perceived failure to combat the targeting of minority groups, said difficulty was no excuse. ""I'm running out of sympathy for 'This is really hard,' because it's really not new,"" she said. ""They find time to release dating apps and they find time to attach to my bank account, but they don't find time to figure out who their users are."" Ms Lux, who described herself to me as a ""gay Jewish lady with a gay Jewish perspective"", said relying on user reports to police hate speech was fundamentally flawed because it could be abused to silence others. ""You just give people with malicious intent the ability to act maliciously,"" she said. Moderation army Facebook remains coy about the make-up of its human moderation team. It said it did try to make sure US-based workers handled incidents where an understanding of American culture was beneficial - likewise for incidents in other countries. But Ms Lux feels the company needs to be more open. ""If you are hiring people who don't exist in certain social circles, different cultures, it's not going to be effective,"" she said. ""It's just going to perpetuate the same issue.""","Facebook says it deleted or added warnings to about 29 million posts that broke its rules on hate speech, graphic violence, terrorism and sex, over the first three months of the year."
"Tass reported telecommunications regulator Roskomnadzor had dropped its threat after the Amazon-owned service removed the offending content. The proposed ban had been prompted by a complaint from a firm that owns the local online rights to the matches. Rambler had claimed 36,000 cases of copyright infringement. A lawyer acting on Rambler's behalf had said on Monday that it was suing the US firm for 180bn roubles (£2.1bn) in damages. But another spokesman for the company subsequently said that sum needed to be ""clarified"". On Wednesday, Twitch said that Rambler had withdrawn its claim and was no longer seeking any financial compensation. ""Twitch will continue to, as has always been the case, effectively and swiftly address any violation of its terms of service with the removal of unlicensed copyrighted content,"" said a spokeswoman for Twitch. ""We look forward to working together with Rambler to achieve this. We remain focused on delivering quality content to our Russian audience."" Russia is the third-largest user of Twitch. The platform's focus is video games but it also offers other live video streams and pre-recorded content. Rambler bought exclusive digital distribution rights for three seasons of the English Premier League from the Russian sports broadcaster Match-TV earlier this year. Amazon has its own interest in restricting access to the Premier League since it recently bought exclusive rights to a number of matches for its own Prime Video service in the UK.","A Russian watchdog no longer plans to block Twitch over a dispute concerning pirated Premier League football games, according to the country's state media."

""The flags actually appeared right where the players start, so I think the people who put them there wanted to gain as much attention as possible."" Hidden 'dynamite' ""Minecraft is about building and rebuilding,"" said Mr Hammeken, who described the incident as part of Minecraft's ""nature of play."" Buildings were destroyed using virtual dynamite - the use of which had been banned on the Danish server - after users discovered it could be detonated when hidden in mining carts. ""It was the players who cleaned up the damage, replacing it with green grass and flowers the following morning,"" said Mr Hammeken. The city was not ""hand-built"" - the topographical data of Denmark was imported into Minecraft, which is also available as a free download on the DGA's website. Those who download the data can upload it to their own private Minecraft server, which will provide a restored city and keep users free from attack. The replica has already been downloaded over 220,000 times since the beginning of this month. Virtual field trips The DGA created the replica of Denmark in order to arouse interest in spatial data, with a particular emphasis on educating children. Its website explains: ""There are real addresses in the game, so it's possible to have a discussion of place names and their meanings."" The agency has also suggested using the replica as a way of taking students on virtual field trips. ""We've discovered children are more motivated to learn when they see something they're familiar with,"" explained Mr Hammeken, who said Minecraft had been used as an educational tool in Denmark for a long time. It is not clear who the ""vandals"" were or why they targeted Denmark.","A virtual replica of Denmark created to help educate children has been disrupted by ""cyber vandals""."
"The drones were designed to bring the internet to remote rural areas, complementing its Loon project - a similar initiative using hot air balloons. However, the solar-powered vehicles have faced technical difficulties and funding challenges. On Wednesday, blog 9to5 Google revealed Titan had actually shut in early 2016. A statement from X, the Google division responsible for Titan, confirmed the news. ""Titan was brought into X in late 2015. We ended our exploration of high altitude unmanned aerial vehicles for internet access shortly after,"" it said. ""By comparison, at this stage the economics and technical feasibility of Project Loon present a much more promising way to connect rural and remote parts of the world."" Google acquired Titan Aerospace in 2014, reportedly fending off a bid from Facebook, which has also been trialling internet-providing drones. At the time Google said it was ""early days"", but that ""atmospheric satellites could help bring internet access to millions of people, and help solve other problems, including disaster relief and environmental damage like deforestation"". However, after test flights began in 2015, reports alleged that Titan was facing technical difficulties and was running out of money. In mid-2015, the Titan team also experienced a crash in the Arizona desert which was later linked to a wing fault. The statement added that ""many"" Titan staff had been reassigned to different parts of the business, including Project Loon and Wing, a division dedicated to providing drone-based deliveries. Facebook's internet drones have also faced problems. The firm's Aquila drone crashed during a test flight in June, prompting an investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board, and an explosion destroyed one of its satellites earlier in 2016.","Google has confirmed it has closed its internet drone project Titan, three years after it bought the business."
"The system aims to allow people to track areas that are in danger of imminent flooding. The FloodAlerts map offers people real-time updates on areas at risk in England and Wales. The system, developed by Shrewsbury-based firm Shoothill, uses data from the Environment Agency's nationwide network of monitoring stations. Crazy rain Users can zoom in on any point of a map of England and Wales to see flood alert and flood warning statuses, as issued by the EA within the previous 15 minutes. Custom searches can also be carried out by postcode. Shoothill managing director Rod Plummer said: ""We are expecting a crazy amount of rain today and in the coming days and the evidence of similar incidences in previous weeks tells us that floods are hitting places that haven't seen such a thing for decades, sometimes with devastating and even tragic consequences. ""Lots of people have reason to be concerned, given the weather forecasts. Those alerts could be to monitor the area around their homes, or perhaps their routes to and from work or their children's schools. ""The same is true for businesses, perhaps especially those who need to keep fleets of vehicles moving as conditions get tough or need to keep a close eye on critical infrastructure."" An Environment Agency spokesperson said: ""Being prepared is vital to help reduce the risk of flooding. With more than five million people living or working in areas at risk from flooding across England and Wales, we are urging communities to use the new application, alongside our existing Floodline Hotline and website updates, to keep one step ahead of future floods."" The system was originally launched on Facebook in April, and has had nearly 2,000 likes. Some 40% who visit the site have gone on to register, according to the Environment Agency. The standalone web map clocked up 100,000 hits in its first four hours.",A live flood warning system has gone online as the UK experiences unseasonable amounts of heavy rain.
"Before now every one of the credit-card sized machines have rolled off production lines in Chinese factories. But a deal signed between Premier Farnell, which distributes the Pi, and manufacturer Sony will see 300,000 of the gadgets produced on home soil. Since its launch in April, the device has been hugely popular and its creators said more than a million could be sold before the end of 2012. The UK-made Raspberry Pis have been assembled at Sony UK Technology's factory in Pencoed, South Wales. About 30 jobs will be created as a result of the deal which will mean most of the Pis being distributed by Premier Farnell will be made in Britain. UK production of the Raspberry Pi started in mid-August and began being delivered to customers this week. Pi boards made in the Welsh plant have ""Made in the UK"" printed next to the power jack. In a blogpost, Raspberry Pi community director Liz Upton said it chose Chinese manufacturers at the start of the project because it could find not find a UK manufacturer that could make them cheaply enough or was willing to take a risk on the bare-bones computer. ""There was just no way to make the Raspberry Pi in the UK and keep the price at $25 (£16) for the Model A... and $35 (£22) for the Model B,"" she wrote. Ms Upton said it had taken six months to get to the point of manufacturing Raspberry Pi computers in the UK. The news about manufacture comes as the design of the machine gets an overhaul. The changes are based around suggestions from Pi owners and will mean tweaks to the way the device works and fix some minor bugs.",The Raspberry Pi computer is being made in the UK for the first time.
"By Chris BaraniukTechnology reporter Systems at Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center had been affected for more than a week. Staff had been forced to carry out some tasks on paper. However, the hospital's chief executive Allen Stefanek, said that the incident had not affected the delivery or quality of patient care. Ransomware is a form of malware which infects a victim's computer, locking it, and demanding that a ransom - often in bitcoins - be paid in order to restore access. Previously, local news sources had reported that the hackers were demanding a ransom payment of $3.4m - but Mr Stefanek denied this. ""The amount of ransom requested was 40 bitcoins, equivalent to approximately $17,000,"" he wrote. ""The quickest and most efficient way to restore our systems and administrative functions was to pay the ransom and obtain the decryption key."" All systems currently in use had been cleared of malware and thoroughly tested, he added. Ransomware attacks are increasingly common. Last year, security firm Kaspersky acknowledged what it said was a ""bitter fact"" - ""unless precautions are taken, victims may not be able to recover their data in any other way than by paying the demanded ransom."" However, when the English county council for Lincolnshire was faced with a £350 ransomware demand last month, it refused to pay. The council has since told the BBC that all systems have been restored without having to pay off the hackers.","A Los Angeles hospital has paid $17,000 (£11,800) to hackers after its computer systems were taken offline by ransomware."
"Testimony given to the International Committee on Disinformation and Fake News warned of ""dire"" consequences if action was delayed. The committee met in Ireland as part of its work to scrutinise how online platforms handle political adverts. But Facebook told members it should not be the world's ""truth police"". The statement came as Facebook policy chief Nick Clegg said the social network was ""considering"" limiting the targeting political parties can do via its platform. In an interview with Politico, Mr Clegg said it might rein in so-called ""microtargeting"" that aims ads at particular interest or age groups. 'Unrelenting' toxicity The committee was formed in 2018 following an investigation by the UK parliament's Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee into disinformation and fake news. Politicians, lawyers, policy advisers, rights activists and data-protection regulators from 12 different nations are all represented on the committee. They signed a declaration calling on countries to ban political ads temporarily after concerns were aired about misleading information already used in adverts for many different elections. ""The toxicity is unrelenting,"" said Jim Balsillie, founder of the Centre for International Governance Innovation, in a statement given to the committee hearing. He said the business model adopted by social networks made ""manipulation profitable"" and led to attempts to influence people via many different means. Marc Rotenberg, head of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, said social networks had been exposed and fined many times for not doing enough to protect their users. He reserved particular criticism for Facebook and said while regulators had sought to oversee its actions in the past, more work was needed. ""The longer enforcement action is delayed the more dire the consequences,"" said Mr Rotenberg. Facebook's head of global policy, Monika Bickert, defended the company and its stance on political advertising. She said in some countries, identities had to be verified before ads could be placed and said it now used third-party fact checkers to scrutinise claims made in adverts. ""In mature democracies with a free press, political speech is already arguably the most scrutinised speech there is,"" said Ms Bickert. ""We therefore don't believe that a private company should be determining for the world what is true or false in a politician's statement."" Earlier this week Facebook banned an advert from a UK tax campaign group for breaking its rules on political advertising. At the same time, UK academics, campaigners and non-profit groups sent a letter to Facebook and Google asking them voluntarily to suspend ads until after the general election on 12 December. The letter said the "" legislative blackspot"" over the regulation of adverts was ""concerning"", as was a lack of transparency over how people are targeted. A BBC investigation into political ads for next month's election suggested they were being targeted towards key constituencies and certain age groups. Facebook's stance on adverts has been criticised by experts who said it gave politicians freedom to create deliberately misleading content. Twitter has taken a different stance and decided in late October to ban all political advertising globally from 22 November. ""We believe political message reach should be earned, not bought,"" said Twitter boss Jack Dorsey.","Targeted political adverts on social media should be suspended until they are properly regulated, says an international group of lawmakers."
"By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter Increasingly services are springing up offering quick fixes for the annoyance of cracked screens or broken home buttons. New entrant, iCracked, is hoping its model of sending technicians to customers, sometimes within an hour, will help it win market share. But critics questioned what impact it would have. The firm already operates in 250 US cities and as the name suggests, focuses mainly on iOS devices but also repairs some Samsung models. The prices it will charge for fixing devices will vary but will average about £57, according to the firm. ""For most people, their phone is an extension of themselves, so when it breaks it can have a huge impact on the way they go about their everyday lives,"" said founder A J Forsythe. The firm began life in 2010 at a US university where Mr Forsythe was a student. ""I started handing out flyers around campus and people would call me and I'd fix their device,"" he told the BBC. Growth came fast and the firm now employs 1,000 technicians across the US. Its UK launch will initially be focused in London with 30 technicians which it hopes to expand to 100 next year. Customers can call out a fixer either via the iCracked website or its app. They then arrange a time for them to come to their home, office or local coffee shop to repair the device. There is a burgeoning industry springing up around smartphone repairs. High street shops offer drop-in services where they can repair phones or tablets in a matter of hours, often more cheaply than iCracked. 'First-World problem' Websites such as Quick Fix Mobile also offer repairs within 24 hours, with prices averaging £30 - £50 for a broken screen. Marketing manager Sean Barber was dismissive of iCracked. ""I'm not sure why these big companies come from the US and make such big news. There are already plenty of others in the UK already offering this service."" He compared iCracked's launch with that of Uber, the lift-sharing service which has proved controversial to the taxi industry. ""I don't think iCracked is going to disrupt the market like Uber did. You still have to book an appointment with a technician and in that time, a customer could have come to a service like ours and had it fixed,"" he said. Mr Forsythe admitted that some may question the need for an emergency service for iPhones, but said that demand was there. ""We're seeing hundreds of requests each day and we are expecting London to be one of our busiest cities. ""I wouldn't say that it is limited to a First World problem."" Apple did not wish to comment on the service but on its website it advises customers to contact their carrier or Apple to arrange service for damaged devices. Users can also take broken phones into stores. There is also a growing trend for do-it-yourself services such as the Restart Project - which gives amateurs advice on how to extend the life of their gadgets.",A US firm is launching an emergency repair service for broken or damaged smartphones in the UK.
"The company said it also planned to introduce additional security to other services, including Yahoo Messenger. Last November, Yahoo chief executive Marissa Mayer announced the company's security measures in the wake of US surveillance disclosures. Since then, users have already been able to access secure versions of popular products like Yahoo Sports. The move came after whistle-blower Edward Snowden leaked documents that alleged that the National Security Agency (NSA) used various technologies to spy on US citizens that included routinely asking firms like Yahoo and others for user information as well as tapping fibre-optic cables that carry global information networks. Yahoo said that as of March 31, all information being transmitted from one Yahoo data centre to another is now encrypted, making it more difficult for outsiders to decipher emails and other information flowing between the centres. Search requests made on Yahoo's home page are also now automatically encrypted, and Yahoo said it was planning to add additional security measures to Messenger and video chat in the coming months. ""Our goal is to encrypt our entire platform for all users at all time[s], by default,"" wrote newly installed chief security information officer Alex Stamos in the blog post. ""We will continue to work hard to deploy the best possible technology to combat attacks and surveillance that violate our users' privacy,"" he added, without specifically mentioning the US government surveillance or allegations that the NSA spied on Yahoo users. Yahoo joined eight other companies, including Google, Facebook, and Apple, to call for reforms to US surveillance programmes in December.",Internet giant Yahoo said in a blog post that all of the traffic to its data centres is now encrypted.
"By Chris BaraniukTechnology reporter The firm asked for Note 7s to be returned following cases of phones that exploded during or after charging. An ad announcing the move appeared on the front page of the JoongAng Daily newspaper. The software update to limit batteries seems intended to provoke users who haven't yet returned their handsets. It will begin to be rolled out from 20 September, the ad says. The Associated Press reported that a similar advertisement also appeared on the front page of the Seoul Shinmun paper. It has not yet been confirmed whether or not a similar update will be pushed out to phones in other countries. The recall of faulty Galaxy Note 7 affects 2.5 million devices. In the UK, Samsung has offered to replace the handsets from 19 September and has asked customers to contact the retailers or mobile operators from whom they bought the phones. Explosion reports There have been more reports about exploding Note 7s causing problems in recent days. The New York Post reported that a six year-old boy in Brooklyn was burned after a Galaxy Note 7 exploded in his hands. He was taken to hospital but has since been discharged. Other reports have, however, suggested the case involved a different Samsung phone. And a Florida man claimed that the device exploded while charging in his Jeep, setting the vehicle on fire. Nathan Dornacher, who was interviewed by Fox News, said the car had been destroyed as a result. Battery cap ""Keeping the battery at 60% or less and an over-the-air update to resolve a hardware problem will not be acceptable to the majority of users, and Samsung's competitors can have a field day with this in device battery life comparisons,"" Chris Jones, an industry expert at Canalys told the BBC. ""Most users will want to get rid of the device as soon as they can if they haven't already."" ""I would say it's not the best solution,"" added Will Stofega at market research firm IDC. ""You don't want to limit the functionality at all."" A spokesman for Samsung said that the firm had worked ""intensively"" to ensure that the quality of batteries was now assured. ""Based on a thorough inspection, we are now confident that the battery issue has been completely resolved in the replacement devices that will be arriving in Europe shortly,"" he said.",Samsung will limit the batteries of South Korean Note 7 smartphones to 60% of their capacity following a recall of the devices.
"By Leo KelionTechnology reporter The report, covering the last three months of 2013, was published by Ofcom. The communications watchdog ranks the five biggest internet providers based on the number of complaints it receives about them adjusted according to the number of customers. It marks the first time EE has not led the name-and-shame list in over a year. Virgin Media had the lowest level of complaints, followed by Sky for the fourth quarter running. TalkTalk came third. According to the figures, Ofcom received 32 complaints for every 100,000 BT fixed-broadband customers between October and December last year. They related to service faults and the way BT's staff had initially attempted to handle the reported problems. The firm was also found to have generated the highest level of complaints about its subscription TV service: 31 per 100,000 customers. The category covers access to the facility and billing, but not the quality of its programmes. ""BT is disappointed with the results in broadband and TV, despite the fact that we've improved from last quarter,"" responded Libby Barr, managing director of BT customer service. ""BT is the fastest-growing business by far in the UK for both pay TV and broadband, and as we process more transactions we have unfortunately suffered more disruption than companies with static or declining customer bases."" In response to this claim, Virgin Media noted that it had increased both the number of its broadband and pay-TV customers over 2013. 'Improving sector' The level of complaints about EE's broadband reported by the regulator was nearly 60% lower than for the same period a year earlier. But the firm said it still had room to improve after Ofcom reported receiving 29 complaints for every 100,000 subscribers over 2013's final quarter. ""We are of course disappointed by these latest results and will take on board the findings of the Ofcom report. We have an ongoing programme to improve service performance,"" said a spokeswoman. Andrew Ferguson, editor of the Thinkbroadband news site, told the BBC there was plenty to be positive about. ""The general trend over time is that the average number of complaints is down, so broadband does seem to be a sector that is improving,"" he said. ""It may be a factor that people have become better at understanding the problems you can have with it and also the various regulations that have come out of Ofcom. ""For example, firms must now let customers walk away if they change prices.""",BT has topped the UK's list of the most complained about broadband providers for the first time.
"The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) makes it illegal to bypass software that prevents the copying of protected work in many situations. But the EFF says that violates the right to freedom of expression by limiting what people can do with things they have purchased. It is now suing the US government. What is the DMCA? The DMCA was introduced in 1998, designed to address copyright for media such as film, music and photography in the digital age. Section 1201 of the law makes it illegal to circumvent ""access controls"" known as digital rights management (DRM) - a provision designed to stop people doing things such as copying films from a DVD and sharing them on the internet. But it has wider-reaching consequences, restricting people from doing things such as: The maximum penalties for violating the law are a $500,000 fine or a five-year prison sentence. What does the lawsuit say? The EFF is suing the United States on behalf of two men, arguing that the law impedes their work. Matthew Green, a computer researcher, could be punished for investigating software vulnerabilities if he had to bypass a copy protection system to do so. ""Despite this work being vital for all of our safety, Green had to seek an exemption from the Library of Congress last year for his security research,"" said the EFF. Andrew Huang, an inventor, has designed software that lets people easily record and manipulate online video. ""Those products would enable people to make innovative uses of their paid video content, such as captioning a presidential debate with a running Twitter comment field,"" said the EFF. ""But using or offering this technology could run afoul of Section 1201."" Are there exemptions? Every few years, the Librarian of Congress grants some exemptions to Section 1201. Some of the current exemptions allow people to: However, the exemptions are temporary and are not always renewed. The EFF said: ""The law imposes a legal cloud over our rights to tinker with or repair the devices we own, to convert videos so that they can play on multiple platforms, remix a video, or conduct independent security research that would reveal dangerous security flaws in our computers, cars, and medical devices."" It's believed the legal action could go on for years before reaching a conclusion.","Digital rights group the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is attempting to overturn parts of US copyright law which, it says, are unconstitutional."
"By Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent It seemed that the Babel Fish envisaged in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy nearly 40 years ago was finally here. But I had one immediate thought: poor Danny. Back in January at the giant CES gadget show in Las Vegas we profiled a young inventor from Manchester who had arrived with something amazing to show off. Danny Manu's product was called Clik, and he billed it as ""the world's first truly wireless earbuds with live voice translation supporting 37 languages"". The demo he gave us was, to be honest, a little clunky, but we were out on the Las Vegas strip and had problems with connectivity. We were impressed by Danny's drive and his promise that the final, much slicker product was coming soon. Since then, we've checked in from time to time, and been told that the Clik earbuds are almost there. Around 4,000 people have ordered them on the Indiegogo and Kickstarter crowdfunding platforms and have had to be patient - although delays of this kind are far from rare. Backers are now being promised a pair of earbuds by the end of the year, and they are available to order by the general public at a price of £219 - although the MyManu website says you will have to wait 16 weeks for them to be delivered. But now Google's Pixel Buds are on sale for £159 and will ship in November. Paired with the Google Assistant on the new Pixel phone, or another high-end Android, they will deliver instant translation straight into your ear. Surely faced with the might and money of this tech behemoth, Danny Manu might as well just put his hands up and accept defeat? Not likely, he told me when I caught up with him. ""Disappointed"" was how he described his reaction to Google's presentation - and not by the threat to his business but the quality of the search giant's product. ""I was expecting companies like Google to come in but I thought they'd do better."" He insists his Clik earbuds do more than the Pixel Buds - group translation with transcripts after a multilingual meeting for one thing, much higher audio quality for another. Whatever the truth about how the rival products stack up, I put it to Danny that a tiny start-up's message just won't be heard above the noise generated by Google. ""We have faith in people,"" he replied. ""People want quality products, they buy into your story."" And the Marriott hotel chain has bought into Danny Manu's story, planning to try out his technology in a Madrid hotel after he mounted an impressive demonstration. Back in January I said that the odds were stacked against Danny - and they just got even longer. But what many great entrepreneurs have in common is an ability to bounce back after every set-back, so I won't be surprised if he does realise his ambition of building a successful tech business here in the UK.",On Wednesday Google unveiled something miraculous at its big hardware event - wireless earbuds that allow instant translation from 40 languages.
"By Rachel StonehouseVictoria Derbyshire programme ""They were talking about rape. They were talking sexual activities that were pornographic,"" Sarah - not her real name - says, recalling some of the graphic messages sent to her child. He had been playing Roblox online - where users build their own games and create characters with coloured blocks. For Sarah, it initially seemed like an ""innocent game"". She had turned on parental controls, so her son - not yet a teenager - could not send messages. But, over time, she noticed a change in his behaviour. He would no longer want to join in with family activities he usually enjoyed. Concerned, she decided to check the game - and discovered he had been communicating with others on a third-party app. It was at that point she realised her son had been groomed into sending sexually explicit images of himself. ""We came across some pictures,"" she tells the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. ""It was horrifying. I was physically sick."" Roblox told the programme it was unable to comment on individual cases but was committed to protecting the online safety of children. It said its in-game chat had very stringent filters and any photo exchange would have been done on a third-party app, that is not ""affiliated or integrated with Roblox"". It added: ""It's extremely important to be aware of these chat apps, particularly [those with an] 'overlay' feature making it appear to be part of whatever game is being played."" It is a situation former police officer John Woodley knows other parents have experienced too. He visits schools across the country with colleague John Staines, warning children about the worst-case scenarios in online gaming, and says parents do not realise people still find ways to communicate with children despite parental controls. On third-party apps, he says: ""They can get them to send pictures and hold verbal conversations with them."" For Amanda Naylor, Barnardo's lead on child sexual abuse, the industry must do more to safeguard children. She says while Roblox can take action if issues are reported to them, children often do not understand the abuse that is happening to them, so do not report it in the first place. In April, it was announced that internet sites could be fined or blocked if they failed to tackle ""online harms"", such as terrorist propaganda and child abuse, under government plans. The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) has proposed an independent watchdog that will write a ""code of practice"" for technology companies. Senior managers could be held liable for breaches, with a possible levy on the industry to fund the regulator. 'Skilled up' parents Ms Naylor also believes parents should be ""skilled up"" in how to protect their children online, without being judged. It is also important that when instances of grooming do occur, she adds, children are given adequate support afterwards - as it can have an impact on their future relationships. Sarah says in her case, she contacted Roblox to ask them how they had ""allowed"" her child to be groomed. ""They didn't respond at all,"" she says. And when she took the case to the police and officers wanted access to the IP addresses of the suspected groomers, Roblox ""refused"". ""They wouldn't let our police have anything to do with it because we were in the UK and they are an American company,"" Sarah says. The police force Sarah was in contact with told the Victoria Derbyshire programme it had the authority to investigate criminal offences that had occurred in the UK only - and in this case the people contacting Sarah's son were in another country. Roblox told the programme players could report inappropriate behaviour using the ""report abuse system"" and users could then be suspended or have their accounts deleted. 'Sexualised manner' Sarah's story is an extreme case but other issues have been highlighted with Roblox's gameplay. Last year, a US mother wrote a Facebook post describing her shock at seeing her child's avatar being ""gang raped"" by others in the online game. She posted screenshots that showed two male avatars attacking her daughter's female character. Roblox said it had banned the player who had carried out the action. One father, Iain, tells the Victoria Derbyshire programme he had similar concerns, after he took control of his son's character to understand more. He says one player told his character to lie down, then laid down on top of him and began moving in a ""disgusting"" sexualised manner. As he stood up, the other person threatened to kill themselves if he left. Iain says he contacted Roblox - but never had a response. Roblox told the programme it was relentless in shutting down inappropriate material and had 24-hour moderators. 'Life-destroying' But according to both Sarah and Iain, more needs to be done to protect children. Sarah says her son is still ""in a very bad way"". ""He's broken, and so are we. It's life-destroying,"" she says. ""I'll never be able to take those pictures and words out of my mind.""

"Dave LeeNorth America technology reporter If you watched every moment of Mark Zuckerberg’s testimony in front of Congress this week, you’ll know he rolled out one phrase an awful lot: “I’ll have my team get back to you.” Now some of these were bits of data Mr Zuckerberg simply didn’t have to hand - such as why a specific advertisement for a political candidate in Michigan didn’t get approved. Other follow ups, though, will require some hard graft from his team. What they produce could provide even more negative headlines for the company, as it is forced to divulge more of its inner workings than it has ever felt comfortable with. Looking through the transcripts, I’ve counted more than 20 instances where Mr Zuckerberg promised to get back to representatives with more information. But these are the assignments I think could cause the company the most headaches - and provide some revealing answers. 1) Data on non-users Set by: Congressman Ben Lujan (Democrat, New Mexico) ""You’ve said everyone controls their data, but you’re collecting data on people who are not even Facebook users who have never signed a consent, a privacy agreement.” Dubbed “shadow” profiles, details of exactly what Facebook gathers on people who haven’t even signed up to the service has been always been a bit of mystery. Even, apparently, to Mr Zuckerberg himself. He testified that he didn’t know the term, but acknowledged the firm did monitor non-users for “security” purposes. Mr Zuckerberg promised to share more details on what data is gathered on people who don’t sign up for Facebook, as well as a full breakdown of how many data points it has on those who do. In a related request, Mr Zuckerberg will provide details on how users are tracked (on all their devices) when they are logged out of Facebook. 2) Moving to opt-in, not opt-out Set by: Congressman Frank Pallone (Democrat, New Jersey) ""I think you should make that commitment.” Creating new regulation will be an arduous, flawed process. But one thing Facebook could do right now? Move to an opt-in model, one which requires users to decide to make something public, as is the default (and most popular) option for posting content now. In a similar vein, Mr Zuckerberg was asked to get back to Congressman Frank Pallone on how the company might consider collecting less information on its users. 3) Repercussions for censorship mistakes Set by: Congressman Steve Scalise (Republican, Louisiana) ""Was there a directive to put a bias in [the algorithms]? And, first, are you aware of this bias that many people have looked at and analysed and seen?” One surprising admission made by Mr Zuckerberg before these hearings was that despite acknowledging the company made big mistakes, nobody has been fired over the Cambridge Analytica affair. Representative Steve Scalise wants to take questions on accountability a step further. In cases where Facebook reverses a decision to remove content - i.e. admitting it over-moderated - what kind of repercussions did those responsible face? If someone created an algorithm that unfairly filtered certain political views, was there any kind of punishment? 4) Specific rules for minors Set by: Senator Ed Markey (Democrat, Massachusetts) ""We're leaving these children to the most rapacious commercial predators in the country who will exploit these children unless we absolutely have a law on the books.” On Facebook the minimum age of users is 13, not counting the company’s Messenger for Kids app (which doesn’t collect the type of data Facebook’s main app does). But for those aged 13-18, or maybe 21, what happens in those oh-so-delicate years should be protected by tighter rules, Senator Ed Markey suggested. Mr Zuckerberg said the idea “deserved a lot of discussion”, but maybe not a new law. He promised to get his team to “flesh out the details”. 5) How many ‘like’ and ‘share’ buttons are out there? Set by: Congresswoman Debbie Dingell (Democrat, Michigan) “It doesn't matter whether you have a Facebook account. Through those tools, Facebook is able to collect information from all of us."" It seems like everywhere you look there is a button prompting you to “like” or share things on Facebook - indeed, there’s one on the page you’re reading right now. A request to at least estimate how many of Facebook’s buttons are out there might at first seem like an abstract demand - but the response could be quite something. The “like"" buttons enable Facebook to track users on pages that are not part of Facebook itself, providing more data for advertisers. If it’s even possible to tot up how many buttons are out there on the web, expect a number in the hundreds of millions - that’s hundreds of millions of pages with which Facebook is tracking your activity beyond its own borders.","Over two days, almost 10 hours."
"By Mark WardTechnology correspondent, BBC News The last few months have seen an ""explosion"" in the number of attacks abusing unprotected time servers, said security company Arbor. Unprotected network time servers can be used to swamp target computers with huge amounts of data. About 93% of all the vulnerable servers are now believed to have been patched against attacks. 'Appropriate' use The attack that paved the way for the rapid rise was carried out by the Derp Trolling hacker group and was aimed at servers for the popular online game League of Legends, said Darren Anstee, a network architect at net monitoring firm Arbor. That attack took advantage of weaknesses in older versions of the software underlying the network time protocol (NTP). Known as an ""NTP reflection"" attack, it used several thousand poorly configured computers handling NTP requests to send data to the League of Legend servers. Around the world about 1.6 million NTP servers were thought to be vulnerable to abuse by attackers, said Harlan Stenn from the Network Time Foundation that helped co-ordinate action to harden servers. Precise timings are very important to the steady running of the net and many of the services, such as email and e-commerce, that sit on it. Early 2014 saw the start of an Open NTP initiative that tried to alert people running time servers to the potential for abuse, Mr Stenn told the BBC. Now, he said, more than 93% of those vulnerable servers had been updated. However, he said, this did leave more than 97,000 still open to abuse. Arbor estimates that it would take 5,000-7,000 NTP servers to mount an overwhelming attack. The feature that attackers had exploited had been known for a long time in the net time community and was not a problem as long as those servers were used ""appropriately"", he said. ""This was before spammers, and well before the crackers started using viruses and malware to build bot armies for spamming, phishing, or DDoS attacks,"" he said. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are those that try to shut servers down by overwhelming them with data. The success of the Derp Trolling attack prompted a lot of copycat activity, said Mr Anstee from Arbor. ""Since that event it's gone a bit nuts to an extent and that tends to happen in the attack world when one particular group succeeds,"" he said. ""We've seen an explosion in NTP reflection activity."" NTP reflection attacks can generate hundreds of gigabits of traffic every second, said Mr Anstee, completely overwhelming any server they are aimed at. The copycat attacks have fed into a spike in the number of ""large events"", mainly DDoS attacks, that Arbor sees hitting the net, he said. ""Historically we used to see a couple of hundred gigabit events every year,"" said Mr Anstee. ""In February 2014 we tracked 43.""",A massive worldwide effort is under way to harden the net's clocks against hack attacks.
"The 11GB of data included social security numbers, names, addresses and salaries of some Socom staff. All the workers, including some with top secret clearances, were employed by subcontractor Potomac Healthcare. The company has now removed the data and said it was investigating the breach. Hostile entities The cache of data was found unprotected on the net by researcher Chris Vickery, from security company MacKeeper. It included details of nurses, doctors and mental health support staff as well as unit assignments and postings dating back to 1998. The data appears to have been exposed when Potomac IT staff misconfigured a data back-up. In a blog about the find, Mr Vickery said he had attempted to get the ""publicly exposed"" data taken off the net by contacting Potomac's chief executives. Initially, Potomac had not seemed to take seriously his warnings that making the data public was a risk to national safety, wrote Mr Vickery. After an hour, he had alerted other government agencies. And 30 minutes later, the data had disappeared. The sensitive nature of the information, including security clearances and the deployment locations of staff, would make it very attractive to ""hostile entities"", said Mr Vickery. ""Let's hope that I was the only outsider to come across this gem,"" he wrote. Potomac acknowledged Mr Vickery's help and said it was ""addressing"" the incident, in correspondence with tech news site ZDNet. Booz Allen Hamilton, the contractor for whom Potomac is a sub-contractor, said it was also investigating.",Sensitive details of health workers employed by the US military's Special Operations Command (Socom) have been exposed in a data breach.
"The Tesla CEO tweeted the development was ""potentially promising"". It's hoped the council will ""promote energy usage transparency"" and encourage miners to use renewable sources. The process of creating Bitcoin consumes large amounts of electricity. Its value fell earlier this month after Tesla withdrew its support of the crypto-currency, citing environmental concerns. Bitcoin operates on the blockchain, a digital ledger of transactions. Miners audit Bitcoin transactions in exchange for an opportunity to acquire the digital currency. It requires enormous computing power, which in turn uses huge amounts of electricity. Bitcoin's electricity consumption is currently greater than The Netherlands', according to the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index. Elson Musk tweeted that the group had committed to publish details of the current and planned use of renewable energy. According to a tweet by MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor, who convened the meeting of the group and Elon Musk, the council includes ""the leading Bitcoin miners in North America"". But research from a group of universities suggested that China accounted for more than 75% of Bitcoin mining as of April 2020. The authors estimated that 40% of China's Bitcoin mines were powered by coal. If anything represents free-market capitalism in its most naked form, it is Bitcoin. It is unregulated, there is no central bank or government in charge of its workings - and some true believers in the crypto-currency are extreme libertarians who hope to see the traditional financial system and much of the infrastructure of the state just melting away. So the idea now being promoted by Elon Musk of a Bitcoin Mining Council to promote sustainable energy use in the crypto-currency's processes seems a touch bizarre. The economics of Bitcoin mining demand that the miner seeks out the cheapest available electricity - that may be hydro-electric power in the United States, but has often been coal-fired power stations in China. Even if the Chinese government succeeds in its clampdown on mining, it's likely that miners in countries like Russia will continue to use electricity generated from fossil fuels. American miners may be sincere in wanting to slap a green energy label on their activities - but the wider Bitcoin market may make that either uneconomic or irrelevant. Earlier this month, Tesla suspended vehicle purchases using Bitcoin, over concerns about its environmental impact. In February it revealed it had bought the equivalent of $1.5bn (£1bn) of the digital currency. ""We are concerned about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal, which has the worst emissions of any fuel,"" Elon Musk tweeted at the time. But the group needs to do more than ""disclosing and promoting the use of renewables"", Alex de Vries of the website Digiconomist told the BBC. ""Even if we had disclosure, that doesn't change the natural incentive of these miners to search out the cheapest and most constant sources of power - which typically comes down to (obsolete) fossil fuels,"" he said. ""Kentucky even came up with a tax break for Bitcoin miners to come and use their obsolete coalfields. So, I'm not seeing this trend towards more renewables."" However council member Peter Wall, Chief Executive of Argo, argued that increasingly US Bitcoin miners were choosing renewable power. He felt the council could encourage change.""It's early days, it's embryonic. There will be lots of discussions moving forward about the best way to promote sustainable Bitcoin mining and to do it not just in North America,"" he said.","A new Bitcoin Mining Council has been created to improve the crypto-currency's sustainability, following a meeting of ""leading"" Bitcoin miners and Elon Musk."
"By Sarah BellVictoria Derbyshire programme The victim received two pictures of an unknown man's penis on her phone via Apple's Airdrop sharing function. Lorraine Crighton-Smith, 34, said she felt ""violated"" and reported it to the British Transport Police (BTP). Supt Gill Murray said this particular crime was new to her force and urged people to report any other incidents. Ms Crighton-Smith, who was travelling on a train in south London, told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme: ""I had Airdrop switched on because I had been using it previously to send photos to another iPhone user - and a picture appeared on the screen of a man's penis, which I was quite shocked by. ""So, I declined the image, instinctively, and another image appeared, at which [point] I realised someone nearby must be sending them, and that concerned me. I felt violated, it was a very unpleasant thing to have forced upon my screen.` ""I was also worried about who else might have been a recipient, it might have been a child, someone more vulnerable than me. ""My name on Airdrop says Lorraine so they knew they were sending it to a woman. The images were of a sexual nature and it was distressing."" 'Report it' Ms Crighton-Smith called the British Transport Police as she said she was worried about the motives of the perpetrator. ""What's the next stage from sending a naked photograph to a stranger, what happens next, was he getting any sort of gratification from it?"" The BTP has investigated the incident, but said because Ms Crighton-Smith did not ""accept"" the photograph there was no technological evidence for them to work with and recorded it as intelligence. Supt Gill Murray said the force had dealt with cases involving Bluetooth but an incident via Airdrop was ""new to us"". ""Receiving an indecent image from someone you don't know must be very distressing and something we would take very seriously. If it happens to you, our advice would be to remain calm, retain the image and report the matter to police as soon as possible,"" she said. ""We have a dedicated Cyber Crime Unit who can analyse mobile phones and track data transfers back to suspects' devices. By linking this to physical evidence, such as CCTV footage or witness statements, we can catch offenders and bring them to justice through the courts."" Airdrop is specific to iOS device and Apple Macs. It uses wi-fi and Bluetooth to talk over a short range to other devices, like other iPhones. Its default setting is for ""contacts only"", which means only people you know can see you. But if you want to share your information or your contacts with other people, you may make a change to the settings and change it to ""everyone"". ""This means that typically in a train carriage, or tube carriage, you can see other devices,"" commented Ken Munro, a cybersecurity consultant at Pentest Partners. ""That's what's happened in this particular case, someone has enabled everyone and then hasn't then set it back. As a result anyone within wi-fi or Bluetooth range can send something to you that's quite horrible."" He added that Apple could tackle the issue by making Airdrop return to its default setting if it had not been used for 10 minutes or so. A spokesman for Apple declined to comment.

"A formatting problem meant that when The Casual Vacancy was downloaded to some e-readers it could only be viewed in a large size that showed a limited number of words per page, or in tiny-sized type. The publisher, Hachette, has released a fixed version. But many users who had pre-ordered the title will have been affected. The novel topped several ebook charts ahead of its release due to high interest in JK Rowling's first novel for adults, following the success of her Harry Potter series. A statement from Hachette acknowledged that it was responsible for the fault which prevented font and margin sizes being adjustable. ""As soon as Hachette was made aware of these issue, a replacement file was uploaded to all ebook retailers,"" the publisher said in a statement. ""Hachette has requested each retailer contact their customers directly about reloading their ebook. ""Any consumer who purchased the ebook on Thursday... who has not heard from the retailer, should contact them and request that their ebook be reloaded. No consumer should have to repurchase the ebook."" The Casual Vacancy's UK publisher, Little Brown, confirmed that users in the country had not been affected. 'Massive frustration' Several users - some of whom had already taken issue with the ebook's $17.99 (£11.22) pre-order price - complained about the error on ebook store review pages. ""I got an electronic reader so that I could make the font large enough for me to read and I'm stuck with a damned magnifying glass,"" wrote one user on Barnes & Noble's site. Another shopper wrote on Amazon's store: ""The Hachette Publishing Group should be ashamed for having so little quality control on such a big release. For shame. Buy the paper edition."" The news site PaidContent, which first reported the issue, noted that strict embargoes imposed on the book's release might have prevented the retailers' staff picking up on the problem before the ebook went on sale. Users affected by the mistake can now manually force their devices to install the update. But one industry watcher said the issue should not be underplayed. ""It was a massive frustration for the true fans who wanted the book to be delivered to them at one minute past the embargoed time, and it shows that publishers are not quite on the money when it comes to ebook formatting,"" Philip Jones, editor of trade magazine The Bookseller, told the BBC. ""This kind of mistake is not as unusual as it should be, and publishers need to get it right from the beginning. In the physical book world an error like this is much more rare. ""But I don't think it will have affected sales of the book or readers enjoyment of it once they have got it.""",US-based shoppers who bought the new JK Rowling novel have been hit by a glitch that made it difficult to read.
"Many of the governments keen to help oversee the net just wanted to use it to silence dissent, he said. Mr Clinton made his comments during a debate sponsored by his charitable foundation, Clinton Global Initiative. The US had been a good steward of the net and had helped keep it open and accessible, he said. Free speech Mr Clinton said it was clear ongoing revelations about National Security Agency surveillance had fuelled demands for the US to step back from its historical role as net overseer. But, he added, it was a ""tribute"" to the US that it had for a long time kept the net ""free and open"" and a place where people could openly criticise lawmakers and heads of state. ""The internet has flourished in freedom,"" said Mr Clinton. ""A lot of people who have been trying to take this authority away from the United States want to do it for the sole purpose of cracking down on internet freedom and limiting it and having governments protecting their backsides instead of empowering their people,"" he said. In mid-March the US government announced its intention to hand over its power to oversee net policy to an international multi-stakeholder group. The actions and decisions of that group would be co-ordinated by Icann - the body set up by the US in 1998 to administer the net's addressing system. ""I understand in theory why we would like to have a multi-stakeholder process. I favour that,"" Mr Clinton said. ""I just know that a lot of these so-called multi-stakeholders are really governments that want to gag people and restrict access to the internet. "" Support for Mr Clinton's fears was given by Wikimedia Foundation boss Jimmy Wales, who shared the platform with the former president. He also said he was ""worried"" about net freedom when the US was no longer in charge. Mr Wales said he was an active member of Icann and regularly attended discussions on how to make the net more sensitive to ""local culture"". But, he said, sensitivity was often just another word for censorship and ending American involvement might make it much harder to defeat calls for the net to be more locally malleable.","Net freedom could suffer after the US steps back from its role as ultimate overseer of the global network, former US President Bill Clinton has said."
"By Zoe KleinmanTechnology reporter, BBC News The device, hidden in an Apple Homepod box, used four smartphones, a circuit board and 1lb (453g) of glitter. Mark Rober, who is now a YouTuber, caught the original thieves on his home security camera. He decided to take action after the police said they were unable to investigate the case. Smelly surprise He designed the elaborate bomb so that it would be activated when the package in which it was hidden was opened by thieves. The phone cameras and microphones would record the moment. The device contained an accelerometer to detect motion. When the parcel was jostled, the device would check the GPS signal to see if it had been moved from its spot. If it had, then it would send a signal to activate the phones and start recording. The glitter was in a cup that spun round on a motor when released as the box was opened. The device was also engineered to squirt a tube of strong-smelling fart spray every 30 seconds. The package was left on Mr Rober's porch with a label saying it had been sent by ""Kevin McCallister"" - the boy played by Macaulay Culkin in the 1990 movie Home Alone. It was stolen on several occasions and re-set to explode and capture the footage every time. On every occasion, the thieves abandoned the package once it had been triggered and they or their property had been doused in glitter. Mr Rober's YouTube video has so far had more than six million views. The former Nasa engineer said: ""If anyone was going to make a revenge bait package and over-engineer the crap out of it, it was going to be me."" Last week, Amazon announced that it is working with police in New Jersey to combat parcel theft crime. Officers are planting dummy boxes fitted with GPS trackers, and hidden doorbell cameras outside homes in areas identified by mapping data of theft locations supplied by Amazon as well as local crime data. One of the parcels was stolen within three minutes.",A former Nasa engineer spent six months building a glitter bomb trap to trick thieves after some parcels were stolen from his doorstep.
"In one, the President wrote his vote advantage in key Democrat-run states had ""started to magically disappear"", and in another that 500,000 votes in key states were at risk. The messages are now hidden behind warnings that say the claims are disputed and might be misleading. The moves also limit users' ability to like and reply to the posts. Twitter had earlier taken similar action over a post in which Trump said for the first time that his opponents ""are trying to steal the election"". Facebook has added fact-check boxes to some of the messages on Mr Trump's profile on its platform, clarifying that final results might take longer than normal - but did not restrict engagement. 'Censor and silence' One of the tweets said: ""Last night I was leading, often solidly, in many key states, in almost all instances Democrat run and controlled. ""Then, one by one, they started to magically disappear as surprise ballot dumps were counted. VERY STRANGE."" He followed that with: ""They are working hard to make up 500,000 vote advantage in Pennsylvania disappear - ASAP. Likewise, Michigan and others!"" Twitter took just over half an hour to react on each occasion. Mr Biden's first tweet of the day said ""we won't rest until everyone's vote is counted"". Twitter has not acted on any of Mr Biden's tweets. But it has hidden a post by the chair of Wisconsin's Democratic Party Ben Wikler who posted that ""Joe Biden just won Wisconsin"". On Tuesday, the Trump campaign claimed that ""Silicon Valley continues its campaign to censor and silence the president"". Timeline alerts Facebook has also been automatically adding labels to all recent posts on Trump and Joe Biden's accounts. They inform readers that votes are still being counted and that the winner of the US presidential election has not been projected. Facebook has begun placing notifications at the top of the timelines for all US users, explaining that the election had not yet been decided. ""Once President Trump began making premature claims of victory, we started running notifications on Facebook and Instagram that votes are still being counted and a winner is not projected,"" it said. Twitter said it had labelled Mr Trump's tweet about the election being ""stolen"" because it violated the firm's civic integrity policy. But the network appears to be allowing some claims of victory, despite warning that it would not. An earlier tweet from Mr Trump that he had enjoyed ""a big win!"" has been left untouched, as has a carefully-worded tweet from Mr Biden that said ""we believe we are on track to win this election"". Analysis: Time for false claims to grow By Olga Robinson, disinformation specialist, BBC Monitoring It's been a busy 24 hours on social media. There's been numerous unsubstantiated or false claims about election fraud, voter intimidation and conspiracy theories about attempts to steal the election doing the rounds. And we are likely to see more misinformation like this in the days to come. The delay in announcing the final result means a lot for time for misleading claims to flourish online. Conspiratorial claims about rigged elections can spread like wildfire, in particular if they are amplified by politicians and online influencers. Premature claims of victory - like the one President Trump made while votes are being counted - can further fuel misinformation and potentially impact how people perceive the final result. This is exactly what some experts have been concerned about: that viral misinformation about voter fraud and ""rigged"" elections might have the potential to undermine people's trust in democratic process for years to come. The clampdown comes after months of preparation for a disputed election. The social media firms have overhauled their policies to deal with false claims of victory and other misinformation about the vote. Both Twitter and Facebook said they had suspended a range of recently created accounts. Twitter said the accounts it targeted had violated its spam and manipulation policies - particularly those that seek to artificially influence online conversations. YouTube also shut down live-streamed fake election results which were being broadcast via several accounts on its platform. The Election Integrity Partnership said that one of them had come up as a top search result within YouTube when users searched election information in key swing states. The research group estimated that more than 26,000 people had viewed the fake results. YouTube said it that ""after careful review"" it was removing livestreams that broke its rules. In a separate incident of apparent election interference, the FBI has said it is investigating a series of robocalls. According to the Washington Post, an estimated 10 million automated calls were made over recent days telling people to ""stay safe and stay home"". They did not specifically mention voting, and their origin remains unknown.",Twitter has hidden some of Donald Trump's first tweets the day after a US election which remains undecided.
"Its automated review filter now ""suppresses around 25%"" of ""suspicious"" reviews it receives, the company said. ""Any that are fake will be swiftly filtered out,"" said a spokesman. But the company admitted its system was not foolproof, and that some filtered reviews could be genuine. Last week New York authorities fined 19 firms a total of $350,000 (£218,500) for posting fake reviews on websites. In a year-long sting operation, the city's attorney-general's office set up a fake yogurt shop in Brooklyn and asked for help from firms offering search engine optimisation (SEO) services that can help boost companies' online presence. Some of these firms created online profiles and then paid for reviews from freelance writers, some from the Philippines, Bangladesh and Eastern Europe. Many businesses were also producing their own fake online reviews, the authorities discovered. The practice is known as ""astroturfing"", reflecting the fact that such consumer - or grass-root - reviews are not genuine. Fraudulent A recent academic report found that the proportion of fake reviews submitted to Yelp had risen from 5% in 2006 to 20% in 2013. Michael Luca of Harvard Business School and Georgios Zervas of Boston University studied the incidence of fraudulent reviews of Boston restaurants posted to Yelp, including those that had been filtered out. After analysing more than 310,000 reviews of 3,625 restaurants, they found that negative fake reviews occurred in response to increased competition, while positive fake reviews were used to strengthen a weak reputation or to counteract unflattering reviews. Fake reviews tend to be extremely positive or negative, they found. ""As crowdsourced information becomes increasingly prevalent, so do incentives for businesses to game the system,"" the authors concluded. Yelp, which has more than 100 million unique visitors a month, expressly forbids paid reviews. About 42 million reviews have been published on Yelp since its launch in 2004.","Yelp, the online directory and consumer review site, says a quarter of the reviews it receives could be fake, as businesses increasingly attempt to skew consumers' opinions."
"By Chris FoxTechnology reporter Flickr Pro subscribers will be able to monitor up to 1,000 images and send automated copyright claims to people or companies that use their photos. ""We want our photographers to feel comfortable sharing their work online,"" said Flickr's Andrew Stadlen. Flickr deleted thousands of photos in February after changing its pricing. Under the ownership of Verizon it had offered all members one terabyte of photo storage for free. But in 2018, its new owner SmugMug said the policy had proved ""staggeringly expensive"" and reduced the allowance to 1,000 photos for non-paying customers. The copy-detection tools will be provided by US start-up Pixsy. Under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), companies such as Facebook and Twitter are obliged to remove any copyright-infringing material they are made aware of. Flickr Pro subscribers will be able to send up to 10 computer-generated DMCA reports for free. However, they will also be able to submit legal challenges and seek compensation if they find their images used without permission for commercial purposes. Pixsy says it has won thousands of legal claims for photographers using its system. Put to the test The BBC put the tools to the test with a selection of images. The first was a photo of one of the tech reporters - Cody Godwin - used in a BBC news story in January. The AI-based tool found the picture on 26 other news websites making it easy to see who had linked to the BBC report and who had simply copied it. Another photograph of Cody taken in the BBC's Los Angeles bureau turned up a surprising result. The tools found an image of Stormy Daniels in the same studio. While the person in the photo was different, the AI had detected that both women were sat in front of the same backdrop. Pixsy says its AI is good enough to spot images that have been turned into merchandise for sale on sites such as Amazon or Etsy. As a final test, the BBC printed an image of tech reporter Zoe Kleinman and stuck it on a mug. The mug did not attract any bids on eBay and so far the tools have not detected it. However, the company says it can take several hours for new posts to be indexed.",Photo-sharing website Flickr is to offer subscribers copy-protection tools that can detect if their images have been used without permission.
"Dorian Prentice Satoshi Nakamoto said he had not even heard of the virtual currency until a few weeks ago. Nakamoto was singled out as the man who wrote the code underpinning Bitcoin by Newsweek. But he said that quotes attributed to him that seemed to suggest his discontinued involvement with the project had been ""misunderstood"". ""I got nothing to do with it,"" Nakamoto told a reporter on Thursday. He was identified as the ""face behind Bitcoin"" in an article published online this week. A reporter spent about two months investigating the claim and tracking him down. When the reporter - flanked by two police officers - found the 64-year-old former physicist at his home in California and asked him if he was involved with Bitcoin, he is reported to have said: ""I am no longer involved in that and I cannot discuss it."" But he told an Associated Press reporter on Thursday: ""I'm saying I'm no longer in engineering, that's it. And even if I was, when we get hired, you have to sign this document, contract, saying you will not reveal anything we divulge during and after employment. So that's what I implied. ""It sounded like I was involved before with Bitcoin and looked like I'm not involved now. That's not what I meant. I want to clarify that,"" he said. 'Unregulated and unstable' Nakamoto said he was born in Japan and moved to America in 1959 and that English was not his first language. The value of Bitcoin has fluctuated as knowledge of and interest in what was until recently a little-known currency has increased. It is used to bypass financial institutions, making it attractive to people who want to trade directly. That has led to a level of adoption by speculative investors and some criminal enterprises. In 2012, a leaked FBI report showed that the the agency was concerned that Bitcoin could become widely used by criminals. The report said that the virtual currency was an ""increasingly useful tool for various illegal activities beyond the cyber realm"". And, in August the following year, it was announced that the ""scale of the risk posed by"" Bitcoin was to be investigated by the FBI on behalf of a US Senate committee. The entity behind it has always been known as ""Satoshi Nakamoto"", although it is unknown whether or not that is a pseudonym. Nakamoto insisted he had never heard of Gavin Andresen, a leading Bitcoin developer. The latter told Newsweek he had worked closely with the person or entity known as Satoshi Nakamoto in developing the system, but that they never met in person or spoke on the phone. Nakamoto told the AP that he would have had the technical ability to come up with Bitcoin. He said: ""Capability? Yes, but any programmer could do that."" He also admitted that elements of the Newsweek story were correct. He said that he did once work for a defence contractor. He added that he also worked on missile systems for the US Navy and Air Force and, consequently, it was necessary to keep many details of his work confidential. Newsweek writer Leah McGrath Goodman, who spent two months researching the story, told the AP: ""I stand completely by my exchange with Mr Nakamoto. There was no confusion whatsoever about the context of our conversation - and his acknowledgment of his involvement in Bitcoin.""",The man named by a magazine as the inventor of Bitcoin earlier this week has denied any involvement.
"By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter, TEDGlobal, Edinburgh This year's TED (Technology, Entertainment, Design) prize, normally given to an individual, was awarded to an idea dubbed ""City 2.0"". Ten projects that are improving city life were selected to benefit from the $100,000 (£64,300) prize fund. Winners include a designer of an open-sourced ""wiki-house"". The first winner, announced at the TEDx summit in the spring, was Ruganzu Bruno who will be using the money to create a play centre, built entirely from plastic water bottles, for children in the slums of Uganda to play and learn. Four of the winners were announced at TEDGlobal, while the rest to be revealed in the autumn. All of the projects are outlined on the City 2.0 website . Self-built houses One of the winners, designer Alastair Parvin from the design practice 00:/, wants to see a more democratised approach to house building. ""For too long, cities have been made by the 1% and consumed by the 99%. We wanted to see what it would take to create something that would allow the 99% to make cities for the 99%."" With this in mind, he and fellow designer Nick Ierodiaconou created a blueprint that would allow ordinary people to build their own homes using open-sourced designs and locally-sourced materials. They posted their designs and assembly directions online and encouraged anyone to try it out, add to it, and upload their own ideas. Since they first initiated the project, five prototypes have been assembled. Mr Parvin aims to team up with youngsters in Brazil and will use the money to allow them to build their own communal wiki-houses in the favelas of Rio. Improved drains Another of the winners, Faisal Chohan, is working on a project to clean up the water in Pakistan's fourth largest city, Rawalpindi. The city sustains a population of two million but, despite government attempts to provide proper sanitation, more than 90% of the city still lives with open drains. ""Every house provides unrestricted access to all kind of insects, including rats up to 12-inches [30.5cm],"" said Mr Chohan. ""The water remains stagnant in streets. First thing out of doors is an unbearable smell. The same drainage passes openly through the main markets of the city where 90% of the people do shopping."" According to the World Health Organisation, more than 30% of all deaths in the city are directly caused by contaminated water. In infants this increases to 40%. Everyday citizens Working with the local community, Mr Chohan is planning to map the city's drainage system and offer the maps up to the local and wider online community to find solutions. Mr Chohan and his tech team will train everyday citizens to map the flow of water in their local areas, give them bicycles so they can get around, and mapping devices so they can register their findings. As well as increasing public health literacy, the system will also act as a warning system for areas of potential cholera outbreaks and hopefully allow for action to prevent them. For him, making cities better places to live means going back to basics. ""At the moment it is not a priority for the government or the people. They see it as too big a problem and I want to change that mentality,"" he told the BBC. Past winners of the TED Prize include chef Jamie Oliver and U2 frontman Bono. It was also announced at the conference that the 2013 prize fund would be increased from $100,000 to $1m.",Developers with innovative ideas about how the cities of the future should look have been honoured at the TEDGlobal conference in Edinburgh.

The buildings have benefited from ongoing conservation work by the New Zealand-based Antarctic Heritage Trust, which co-operated with Google on the project. Both structures had previously appeared on the World Monuments Watch List of the most endangered sites in the world. Frozen food Shackleton's hut is located at Cape Royds, where the explorer and nine other team members left their ship, the Nimrod, to stay during the winter. It still houses about 5,000 of the team's personal possessions including books, clothing and canned food, which have been preserved by the cold temperatures. Shackleton's expedition was the first to climb the volcano Mount Erebus, but bad weather and diminished supplies caused them to turn back about 156km (97 miles) before reaching the south pole. Nevertheless this was the furthest south anyone had reached at the time and the group returned to the UK as heroes. Scott's base at Cape Evans was erected three years later and still contains more than 8,000 artefacts from his doomed adventure. Boxes of Tate sugar cubes, Heinz Tomato Ketchup bottles and clothing can be seen in the uploaded pictures from the location. Scott and four others did reach the pole in January 1912 but found they had been beaten to there by a Norwegian party led by Roald Amundsen. The members of Scott's party died as a result of the freezing conditions during their return journey. Google said it had carried out the fish-eye lens photography project to provide school children and others with an ""insight into how these men lived for months at a time"". In addition to the two huts it has also added images of the Ceremonial South Pole - where flags can be seen planted by the various teams that reached the spot - as well as the Cape Royds Adelie Penguin Rookery.",Images of the Antarctic huts used by polar explorers Sir Ernest Shackleton and Robert Falcon Scott have been posted online as part of the latest extension to Google's Maps service.
"Not to be confused with China's TikTok, ToTok markets itself as an easy and secure way to chat by video or text. However, The New York Times (NYT) has reported allegations that the WhatsApp-lookalike is a spy tool for the United Arab Emirates government. ToTok has told users that it will be back in the app stores soon. In a blog, it wrote that it is ""temporarily unavailable"" on the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store because of a ""technical issue"". Citing American officials as sources, the NYT reported that ToTok gives UAE spies access to citizen's conversations, movements, and other personal information like photos. Google removed the app last Thursday and Apple pulled it the following day. However, ToTok users, who already have the app on their phone, can carry on using it. Millions of users ToTok is only several months old but it has been downloaded by users in the Middle East, Europe, Asia, Africa, and North America, according to the NYT. Google Play Store showed that it had five million Android downloads alone before it was removed, while app-tracker App Annie said that ToTok was one of the most downloaded social apps in the US last week. The NYT reports that the app's publisher, Breej Holding Ltd, is affiliated with DarkMatter, which is an Abu Dhabi-based intelligence and hacking firm that is allegedly under investigation by the FBI for possible cyber-crimes. DarkMatter employs Emirati intelligence officials, former National Security Agency employees and former Israeli military intelligence operatives, according to the NYT. ToTok, DarkMatter, and the Embassy of United Arab Emirates in London did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ""While the existing ToTok users continue to enjoy our service without interruption, we would like to inform our new users that we are well engaged with Google and Apple to address the issue,"" ToTok said in a blog. It pointed out that new users with Samsung, Huawei, Xiaomi and Oppo phones could still download ToTok on the phone maker's own app stores. The company promised to be back ""in the near future"" with new features such as payment, news, commerce, and entertainment. Other messaging services like WhatsApp and Skype, which offer end-to-end encryption, are restricted in the UAE. While they can be used for messaging, they can't be used for video calls. ToTok's privacy policy states that it may share people's personal data with ""law enforcement, officials, regulatory agencies and other lawful access requests"". It also states: ""We may share your personal data with group companies."" However, there is no specific mention of the United Arab Emirates government. Decrypting the app Security firm Objective-See says that it worked with the NYT on the investigation. In a blog, the company explained that it performed an analysis of ToTok's iOS app on a ""jailbroken"" iPhone - ie one which had been altered to bypass manufacturer restrictions. Analysts decrypted the ToTok app and the app's ""network traffic"". The analysts said that the legitimacy of the app is ""really the genius of the whole mass surveillance operation"". They noted that they found no backdoors, no malware, and no exploits in the app.",Google and Apple have removed an Emirati messaging app called ToTok amid claims that it is used for state spying.
"Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent@BBCRoryCJon Twitter Taryn Southern has been working with artificial intelligence tools for some years. Her single Break Free was composed with the help of AI tools. Of course, musicians have been adopting all kinds of technology for years, and using computers to generate or enhance new music is not new. But Taryn says her work with AI is different because the feedback loop enables the computer and the artist to learn from each other. ""Once the AI exports a song and the artist makes changes, the neural network can learn from their suggestions and start to develop a taste for the artist's preferences,"" she explains. While Taryn is a pop artist, the AI she uses has been trained on thousands of hours of piano pieces from the 18th Century and searches for patterns in them. That means it has different influences to her own. ""If I grew up listening to the Beatles and Britney Spears and N-Sync, chances are that I'm going to be drawn to making music more in that style,"" she explains. ""By working with an AI that is trained to find patterns that my own brain cannot find, that forces me as an artist to think out of the box."" In this case, AI is augmenting the work of humans rather than replacing it. Taryn Southern describes her work as being like a film director getting the best out of the artificial intelligence in a collaborative process. She's not the only one in this field. Jukedeck and a number of similar tech firms are using AI to generate music that can act as a soundtrack for videos. The technology continues to advance - but has it taken music in interesting new directions? You can hear for yourself in this week's podcast. Also on the podcast this week:","How close are we to hearing a song composed by a computer making it to number one in the charts? On this week's Tech Tent, we meet the musician who hopes she can make that happen."
"Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent@BBCRoryCJon Twitter Last month, the creator of the World Wide Web Sir Tim Berners-Lee, told us of his plan to put it back on the right track. His Contract for the Web aims to get companies, countries and individuals to work together to combat cyber-bullying, misinformation and other online harms. Catherine Miller of the think tank dot everyone, which describes its mission as championing responsible technology for a fairer future, gives us her assessment of how likely it is that we will make the web a better place in 2020. She stresses that better regulation will be key, changing the economic incentives that mean the tech giants fight to keep people hooked to their platforms, and reward damaging behaviour. When it comes to the race to build what is arguably the key technology of our times - artificial intelligence - the consensus has been that the United States is in the lead, but China is catching up fast. Now a new global AI index produced by the online news site Tortoise has come up with a more nuanced picture. It found that, yes, the US and China were one and two in AI, with the UK in third place. But Alexandra Mousavizadeh, the data scientist who led the project for Tortoise Intelligence, tells us that China was much further behind than they had expected. It scored well in research and development, but its 18th position in having the people with the right skills held it back. ""This race is going to be won in many different ways,"" says Ms Mousavizadeh, stressing that the free market bottom-up approach of the US had proved very fruitful so far, but the top-down Chinese strategy also has its strengths. But she says that around the world a government strategy for developing human capital - ""preparing a workforce for working with and being part of AI driven growth"" - will be key. We also look less far ahead - to CES, the huge annual gadget-fest which opens in Las Vegas on Tuesday. No doubt we will see all sorts of products promising to use AI to give consumers better experiences. But one of the keynote speakers looks likely to provide the biggest headlines from the show. On the opening day, Ivanka Trump will be discussing the future of work in a session with the Consumer Technology Association's CEO Gary Shapiro. The invitation to the President's daughter has sparked controversy, especially as female keynote speakers from the tech industry have been thin on the ground in previous years. Mr Shapiro tells Tech Tent that the show is about more than gadgets. It addresses key issues such as the impact of automation on work - and he says as the co-chair of the American Workforce Advisory Board, Ms Trump has significant things to contribute to this debate. But back to technology. I have just been looking back at a blogpost I wrote on New Year's Eve 2009 as I prepared to head off to the 2010 CES in Las Vegas. I was very excited about a British firm called Plastic Logic that was going to unveil a radical new e-reader. ""It could be one of the show's stand-out products,"" I wrote, ""or it could end up buried under an avalanche of hype about a forthcoming rival device from a better-known firm."" That rival device turned out to be Apple's iPad, unveiled later that month, and Plastic Logic's Que device did indeed end up dead and buried. So, expect to see some startling new products emerging from Las Vegas in the next few days - we are promised a talking frying-pan and a self-driving sofa - but world-changing devices are few and far between, and are likely to be unveiled elsewhere.","Will we start the journey to a better, kinder internet? Which countries are best placed to win the AI race? And should Ivanka Trump be speaking at a tech show? Just some of the questions we address in the first edition of Tech Tent this year."
"By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor Fitness+ collects health data gathered by an Apple Watch and then displays it alongside workout videos shown on a larger display. The platform will compete with existing fitness apps on iOS from Peloton, Les Mills and Fiit. It also poses a challenge to Fitbit, whose wearables benefit from their own health-coaching subscription service. As many had forecast, Apple decided to hold back details of its next iPhones for a separate event. Yoga and dance Like some of its rivals, Fitness+ also allows competitive users to see how their own efforts compare with others who have completed the same fitness routine previously. ""Health-tracking continues to be a major focus for Apple, and its new Fitness+ service signals its intent to generate more revenue from its products in this area,"" commented Leo Gebbie from the consultancy CCS Insight. Fitness+ will initially launch in six countries including the US and UK before the end of 2020. It will cost £10 per month or £80 per year as a standalone service, which can be shared among members of the same family. Alternatively, it can be purchased alongside other Apple services - including iCloud storage, Arcade video games and Apple Music - for about £30 per month - as part of the top tier of a bundle of services called Apple One. Other mixes of services can be subscribed to for lower fees. ""Support for 10 different workouts with and without equipment, and the fact it is being sold at a family price will make Fitness+ very attractive,"" said Carolina Milanesi from the Silicon Valley-based consultancy Creative Strategies. ""And I don't think bundling it with the other services is anti-competitive, as you are seeing other services do the same thing - for example Disney's Hulu TV service in the US with Spotify."" Spotify, however, has suggested the bundles are another example of Apple abusing its ""dominant position"" and has called on regulators to intervene. But one personal trainer said he did not see the new service as competition for one-on-one sessions with an online coach. ""The real results come from support, accountability and understanding human behaviour, and being able to tailor a fitness regime to an individual so that it is sustainable,"" Sam Wake told the BBC. Oxygen saturation Apple unveiled two new ranges of smartwatches: the high-end Series 6 Watch and lower-priced Watch SE. The Series 6 introduces a blood-oxygen sensor to help manage conditions that affect the heart and lungs. It measures SpO2 levels, which indicate how much oxygen is being carried by the user's red blood cells from the lungs to other parts of their body. Apple suggested this could potentially act as means to detect the early onset of respiratory problems, although its small print says the feature is ""not intended for medical use"". Samsung, Huawei and Fitbit already sell smartwatches that provide the same facility. However, their ability to offer it has depended on the approval of local health regulators. Apple has published a list of where it will offer the feature, confirming it includes the UK and most other countries. The SE model lacks the new sensor, uses a slower processor and does not have an ""always-on"" display, but otherwise offers most of the features found in the more expensive model. These include sleep-tracking and a new facility targeted at children called Family Set-up. It can be set to trigger automatic location notifications to a child's parents when the wearer visits familiar places like their grandparents or school. It also makes it possible to assign a unique phone number to a Watch, rather than using one that already belongs to an iPhone. ""A logical use would be for a parent to give a child a cellular-enabled Apple Watch so they can remain in contact,"" commented Mr Gebbie. ""We expect to see hand-me-down Watches used in this scenario, rather than a device bought specifically for this purpose."" The Series 6 range starts at £379 and SE at £269. A14 chip Apple's new iPad Air is the first product from the firm to be based on a new chip-manufacturing process that promises more processing power and better energy efficiency thanks to the fact that transistors can be packed together more densely than before. Apple typically launches its new chips inside its iPhone before its iPads, but this year the release of its new handsets have been delayed by the Covid-19 pandemic. The company suggested the A14 processor would make it easier to edit 4K videos and do motion-tracking of real-world objects for augmented reality apps. The machine has a fingerprint sensor built into one of its side buttons to reduce the size of the bezels, and also introduces a USB-C port, which until now had been limited to the more costly iPad Pro range. The new iPad Air also has a slightly larger screen than before - 10.9in (27.7cm) - but it costs £100 more, starting at £579. The firm also unveiled a new lower-priced basic iPad that uses the older A12 chip. It starts at £329, which is £20 less than before. Demand for tablets across the wider tech industry has risen since the start of the coronavirus pandemic as consumers increasingly used them for entertainment, home schooling and remote working. Shipments in the April-to-July quarter were up 19% on the same period in 2019, according to research firm IDC, with Samsung, Amazon and Huawei among those making even bigger gains. According to IDC's figures, Apple's iPads remain the market leader, but only saw a 2% annual gain. ""Apple kept its volume but its rivals made strides via the opportunistic sale of cheaper devices,"" commented IDC's Marta Pinto. Apple also announced that iOS 14 - the latest version of its mobile operating system - would be released on Wednesday, This came as a surprise to many developers, who thought they had more time to submit corresponding new versions of their products to Apple's App Store.",Apple has unveiled a new personalised workout subscription service alongside new smartwatches and tablet computers.
"Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent@BBCRoryCJon Twitter There was the chairman of Google, the chief executives of many of Europe's biggest telecoms firms, politicians from the UK and across Europe, founders of companies ranging from Carphone Warehouse and ARM, to the machine-learning business Deep Mind. This was the Founders' Forum, a gathering where very rich people get together to hear about ideas that might make them even richer - and also find out about charitable ventures which could do with their backing. They took part in a debate on the internet of things, the hottest tech trend right now. They heard pitches from start-up businesses ranging from an app for football fans to a loan scheme to turn people in developing countries into freelance computer programmers. And they saw demos of exciting gadgets - a drone taking aerial pictures of the hotel, a Kickstarter-funded artificial intelligence car-racing game, a robot on wheels with a tablet whose screen showed the explorer Bear Grylls and the actor Stephen Fry around the event. But for me one story stood out. It came from a young entrepreneur I met while we were both standing at a charging station topping up our phones. I asked Thor Fridriksson where he was from and what he did and he explained that he lived in Reykjavik in Iceland and he'd launched a phone game called QuizUp quite recently. Mildly intrigued, I asked what kind of backing he had and he said his investors included Sequoia and Tencent - had I heard of them? As one is amongst Silicon Valley's most formidable venture capital firms and the other is China's social media giant, it was clear that Mr Fridriksson was really going somewhere. Then he explained how a man from Iceland had managed to convince American and Chinese investors to back his idea with funding running into millions of dollars. Just two years ago, after developing a smartphone game for children that sank like a stone, he was broke. Then a light went on in his head - an idea for a trivia game that would be social, that would engage people fascinated by niche subjects. So certain was he that he was on to a winner that he caught a flight to San Francisco with two software engineer colleagues, rented a shabby apartment, and started pitching. ""I began by cold calling and emailing investment firms. Most didn't respond, a few said I might get an appointment in five months - I didn't have that long!"" A month in, while the software guys were still working on the prototype, Thor was beginning to despair. But he improved his pitching technique., and began to hang out at networking events and cafes where he might meet big names in venture capital. Finally one of them bit, and offered some seed investment. After that, the money rolled in. The trio returned to Iceland with more than $1m, and continued to work on QuizUp. Yet it was not until November last year, 18 months after they had set off for San Francisco that the game was finally released. Their backers had shown huge patience with a project which could still have been a flop - indeed more of them had arrived making the total invested nearly $7m. Luckily, the reception for Thor's game was hugely enthusiastic. ""We reached our millionth user after one week, far better than we ever expected. It put huge strain on our servers and we were working day and night but it was fun."" It turned out to be the fastest hit that Apple's US App Store had ever seen. QuizUp had been designed to be viral, encouraging users to create their own subjects - from Game of Thrones to flags of the world, and to submit their own questions. Just six months on there are 20 million users, and 100,000 contributors have submitted half a million questions. There is hardly any revenue yet, but they're experimenting with sponsored content and they've already got a World Cup sponsor on board for quizzes relating to the tournament. But my question for Thor Fridriksson was still how on earth an Icelander with no track record had managed to raise so much money. He explained that once they had bought into the original idea it was a matter of delivering what you promised: ""Then they will give you more money because they believe in you."" He says he could not have raised that kind of money in Iceland. And investors at the Founders Forum told me that in the UK too there was still a funding gap - you can raise seed capital, but getting the cash needed to move on to deliver on your idea is a lot harder. It seems that for a young entrepreneur with a brilliant but unproven idea, California is still the place where dreams can come true.",In a luxury hotel north of London yesterday you could find one of the wealthiest and most influential tech crowds ever assembled.
"By Mark WardTechnology correspondent, BBC News Over a few weeks, the BBC put together a crude game for a smartphone that also spied on the owner of the handset. The application was built using standard parts from the software toolkits that developers use to create programs for handsets. This makes malicious applications hard to spot, say experts, because useful programs will use the same functions. While the vast majority of malicious programs are designed to attack Windows PCs, there is evidence that some hi-tech criminals are starting to turn their attention to smartphones. Booby-trapped applications for smartphones have been found online and in recent weeks Apple and Google have removed applications from their online stores over fears that they were malicious. Chris Wysopal, co-founder and technology head at security firm Veracode, which helped the BBC with its project, said smartphones were now at the point the PC was in 1999. At that time malicious programs were a nuisance. A decade on and they are big business, he said, with gangs of criminals churning out malware that tries to steal saleable information. Mobiles, he said, offered a potentially more tempting target to those criminals. ""Mobile phones are really personal devices,"" said Mr Wysopal. ""You might have one computer for a family but every family member has a personal device and it is with them all the time."" Simeon Coney, a spokesman for mobile security firm AdaptiveMobile, said criminals were focused on handsets for one simple reason: money. ""In the PC domain the only way a criminal can generally take money from a user is by having them click on a web link, go to a website, purchase a product and enter their credit card details,"" said Mr Coney. ""In a mobile network the device is intrinsically linked to a payment plan, to a user's credit,"" he said. Nothing happens on a mobile network, no call is made or text is sent, without money changing hands. Criminals have tapped into that revenue stream by getting phone owners to dial or contact premium rate numbers. Now they are turning their attention to applications and the lucrative information they scoop up. The App Genome project by mobile security firm Lookout was set up to map what applications produced for smartphones do. It tried to find out if they do everything they claim and if they do more than expected. The project has looked at 300,000 smartphone applications and mapped the internal functions of one-third of them. It found that about one-third of applications it has studied seek to get at a user's location and about 10% try to get at contact and address lists. The study also found that a significant proportion of applications included code copied and pasted from other programs. Code creator To get a better understanding of the barriers to creating malicious programs the BBC downloaded a widely used application development kit, learned the basics of programming in Java and gathered some snippets of code already released on the net. It was possible in a few weeks to put together a crude game that also, out of sight, gathered contacts, copied text messages, logged the phone's location and sent it to a specially set up e-mail address. The spyware took up about 250 lines of the 1500 making up the entire program. The code was downloaded to a single handset but was not put on an application store. All of the information-stealing elements of the spyware program were legitimate functions turned to a nefarious use. ""That's kind of the scary thing,"" said Mr Wysopal from Veracode. ""The face of the application, be it a game or a simple application that is for fun, can have behaviour that is not visible at the surface."" ""There's been cases of spyware being detected on the internet, downloaded even from application stores or from other websites. We've detected it out there,"" said Mr Wysopal. ""On the personal side there are cases of jilted lovers cyber-stalking their ex-boyfriend or ex-girlfriend through their phone."" The big application stores offering programs to mobile owners do police the software they are offering. Apple vets applications and rejects those that fail its commercial and coding tests. Google said that applications for Android must declare all the information they will gather when they are downloaded. Blackberry maker RIM and Google use a code-signing system so they can turn off applications that prove to be malicious. However, it can be difficult to separate malicious programs from legitimate ones because the connectedness of a mobile means many applications need access to contact lists and location data. For example, gamers might want to brag to their friends about achievements, post high scores to Facebook or play with a friend if they are close by. All of which would need legitimate access to those sensitive details. Safety steps Ilya Laurs, founder of independent application site GetJar, said it was ""very hard"" for application stores to separate programs using personal information legitimately from those with a malicious intent. Many handset hackers would likely copy existing applications and add-in malicious code, said Mr Laurs. ""It's way less effort to hack into someone else's application, as you do not have to write it yourself,"" he said. Many would do that, said Mr Laurs, to ensure they hit plenty of victims. ""What's most important for hackers is how do they get scale,"" he said. ""If they write their own application, such as a game, they may only get 200 downloads."" By contrast, he said, stealing a popular application, packing it with booby-trapped code and offering it for free can reap rewards. Some application makers have found that 97% of the people using their software are doing so via pirated versions. Application stores are making efforts to police the programs they offer. So far the number of booby-trapped applications remains low. But many feel the threat is only likely to grow. Users can take a few simple steps to stay safe. ""Ask which developer an application is coming from, not just the site or carrier because that's only half of the story,"" said Mr Laurs. ""Ask who they are and do you trust them."" Phone owners should also back up data on their handsets to a PC or net-based service to guard against problems. Nigel Stanley, a security analyst at Bloor Research, said there were telltale signs that revealed if people had been caught out. ""A very obvious tell-tale sign on the phone is all of a sudden your battery life is deteriorating,"" he said. ""You wake up one morning and your battery has been drained then that might indicate that some of the data has been taken off your phone overnight."" Smartphone owners should also keep an eye on their bill. ""Look at your billing information every month and if there are strange numbers appearing on your phone bill that might indicate that there is some software on there that is dialling out to premium-rate lines, billing you for a service that you have not authorised,"" he said.",BBC News has shown how straightforward it is to create a malicious application for a smartphone.
"By Ben ParkerBBC News The company said Kurt Fenech, known online as Kurt0411, had posted ""abusive and threatening messages"" about its employees. It said it had banned his account and blocked his console from accessing its games. Mr Fenech denied making abusive remarks and told the BBC he thought the ban was an ""abuse of power"". The gamer has more than 100,000 subscribers on YouTube and often attracted more than 10,000 viewers to his live streams of the Fifa 20 football video game. The 25-year-old, from Malta, previously played Fifa professionally, competing in tournaments for cash prizes. He was also an outspoken critic of EA Games and the Fifa games, criticising the software and its developers in his YouTube videos. He has highlighted technical issues and frustrations with the software, which EA says has more than 10 million players. Other players have been critical too. The world's top-ranked Fifa 20 player Donovan Hunt, known as Tekkz, recently said at a professional event: ""It's so unrewarding, anyone can win, guys who aren't good can win at Fifa 20 and no-one enjoys playing it."" 'Toxic behaviour' EA Games said it was ""open to feedback and constructive criticism"" but would not tolerate ""toxic behaviour"". It sent Mr Fenech a ""final warning"" in March 2019 for violating its code of conduct for professional players. In November 2019, Mr Fenech was banned from all competitions after EA said he made ""additional online attacks against competitors and EA employees"", which he denies. Following the ban, two EA employees had their Twitter accounts hacked. Mr Fenech responded: ""We use their slowness and delayed movements to our advantage."" And in a video uploaded in February, he named and criticised an EA community manager, showed doctored images of the man and called him a ""bum"". EA said it had banned Mr Fenech because he ""continued to post abusive and threatening messages and videos about EA employees and competitive players on social media and has encouraged others to do so"". Some of Mr Fenech's Fifa videos have been taken down from Twitch and YouTube after copyright claims purporting to be from EA Games. 'Harsh opinion' Speaking to the BBC, Mr Fenech said: ""Upon reflection I could see that I definitely did push the limits and, although merited, I shouldn't have made it as personal as I did. ""I accepted the initial account ban even though I deemed it harsh. But to then realise that the ban means I can never stream Fifa ever again is absolutely ridiculous and a clear abuse of power from EA."" The video-maker says he will continue to stream other video games and has already broadcast himself playing Pro Evolution Soccer, a rival game published by Konami. ""I just gave my opinion - albeit harsh opinion - on everything EA has been doing wrong, but I guess in today's world you can't even give that,"" Mr Fenech told the BBC. ""The only explanation is I became too much of a threat to a company, which has an obligation to provide a decent football game for football fans worldwide but in the past few years has stopped caring about us and is only interested in making money."" Several gamers posted messages of support for Mr Fenech on Twitter. ""Community outrage does nothing to them while money pours in,"" said one Fifa streamer on Twitter.","Entertainment giant EA Games has banned a well-known streamer from playing any of its titles, citing abusive conduct."
"Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent@BBCRoryCJon Twitter No wonder then that a young former technology journalist Alexander Kloepping is attracting attention - and investment - from the likes of the New York Times and the Axel Springer group. His idea is called Blendle, and in his native Holland it has brought hope of better times for newspapers, in much the same way as Spotify has shaken up the music industry. Blendle allows the Dutch papers - which have all signed up to the service - to charge small payments for individual articles. Blendle subscribers are presented with a series of cards on their home screen, showing the first paragraphs of articles which may interest them. If they click to read on they are charged somewhere between 20 cents (14p) and 90 cents (63p), although if they get to the end and decide they are unsatisfied they can get a refund. Of half a million people who signed up to Blendle, about 100,000 have actually opted to pay for articles. Kloepping says that is a good start and compares it to the 20% of Spotify users who pay rather than opt to listen to adverts. On this week's Tech Tent he explains that readers are generally choosing to pay for opinion and background pieces rather than hard news. I was surprised that they would pay as much as 90 cents. ""It's not about the price,"" he says. ""It's about the ease of use. When you know it's one click away and you can get your money back, then users are really comfortable spending small amounts on articles that are really relevant to them."" He is now hoping to bring the Blendle recipe to other countries, notably the United States. But he could find readers far more reluctant to spend money on articles than Dutch customers have been. Newspapers in the Netherlands had been very conservative in putting much of their longform journalism online, which in retrospect seems to have been a wise strategy. Readers have not had access to that content without buying a paper, so paying to get it online is not such a hard choice. But in other countries, newspaper groups rushed to put everything online for free, before staging a partial retreat and in some cases erecting paywalls. While specialist titles like the Financial Times have made them work, others have found that their readers are reluctant to pay. In the UK the Sun newspaper has just abandoned a two-year experiment with a paywall. Alexander Kloepping admits that getting cash out of readers is hard, but says media groups have not given up on the idea: ""All over the world, publishers are shifting to models on the web where they expect users to pay, but they see it's not working for them."" His solution is a model which does not tie readers into a subscription to one newspaper but offers them a menu from which they can snack at will. The other route, which sees online journalism supported by advertising, is certainly looking ever less attractive. This week the most successful exponent of the art of pulling in huge online crowds and serving them adverts, the Daily Mail group, unveiled its latest figures. They showed an impressive 24% rise in online audience to 208 million, and an 18% rise in online ad revenues. But that was not enough to offset plunging print revenues, and with advertisers paying less for every click, the old saw that analogue dollars are being replaced by digital cents looks truer than ever. But there is one other route to online profits which more and more news sites are now heading down. It is called branded content and is what we used to call advertorial. It involves creating readable and watchable material for corporate customers which does not look like traditional advertising - and it has proved very lucrative for the likes of Buzzfeed. All sorts of media companies are now trying this out, from the New York Times to the podcast maker Gimlet Media. But it brings with it all sorts of ethical dilemmas. A recent edition of Gimlet's Startup podcast - which documents its own journey as a new tech business - featured agonised discussions about branded content. During an episode called ""Words about Words from Our Sponsors"" Gimlet staff try to work out how far they should go in allowing their brand as a journalistic product to be associated with the companies for which they make branded podcasts. Such debates are going on in all news organisations right now. Turning good journalism into a profitable business has never been easy, but in the digital era it is proving to be more complicated than ever. Rory Cellan-Jones presentsTech Tent on BBC World Service at 15:06 GMT on Friday 27 November - listen afterwards on BBC iPlayer Radio","Got any idea of how to make money from news in the online era? Well prepare for the media giants to beat a path to your door, as they struggle with plunging print advertising revenues and an audience that seems to think news should be free."
"By Dave LeeTechnology reporter, BBC News The company has long been criticised for enabling people to find sites to download entertainment illegally. The entertainment industry has argued that illegal sites should be ""demoted"" in search results. The new measures, mostly welcomed by music trade group the BPI, will instead point users towards legal alternatives such as Spotify and Google Play. Google will now list these legal services in a box at the top of the search results, as well as in a box on the right-hand side of the page. Crucially, however, these will be adverts - meaning if legal sites want to appear there, they will need to pay Google for the placement. The BPI said that while it was ""broadly"" pleased with Google's changes, it did not think sites should have to pay. ""There should be no cost when it comes to serving consumers with results for legal services,"" a spokesman told the BBC. In numbers: Piracy battle Source: Google report into piracy ""Instead we have urged Google to use the machine-readable data on the Music Matters website, which lists all services licensed in the UK, and to promote these legal services above illegal sites and results in their search, using appropriate weighting applied fairly and equally across services."" 'Legitimate sources' Google has also added extra measures to doctor its search results so that links pointing to illegal content fall lower in results, with legal sites floating to the top. The company has been doing this for several years, but now says it has ""refined the signal"" for detecting these links. To coincide with the announcement, Google published a report into the measures it has put in place across its various websites. On YouTube, for instance, its Content ID system is able to detect the use of copyrighted material in videos - offering music labels the choice of having the content removed, or monetising it by placing advertising. But the report stressed the long-held view from Google that the solution to piracy lay in putting effort into creating better legal services, rather than chasing off illegal ones. ""Piracy often arises when consumer demand goes unmet by legitimate supply,"" the report said. ""As services ranging from Netflix to Spotify to iTunes have demonstrated, the best way to combat piracy is with better and more convenient legitimate services."" Ongoing row The BPI and Google have been at logger-heads over downgrading results for several years. The music industry has been angered by the way in which a search on Google for ""listen to Katy Perry"", or any artist, would sometimes produce results pointing to places to download content illegally. Often, the illegal sites would rank higher than official outlets such as iTunes. Google, reluctant to tamper with its ""organic"" results, but leant on by the government, has gradually backed down and implemented some measures, although their effectiveness is often disputed. Other combative measures pushed by the BPI include the blocking of websites such as the Pirate Bay so that UK internet users cannot visit unless they are using specialist software. ""We will monitor the results carefully,"" said Geoff Taylor, chief executive of the BPI. ""But we are encouraged that Google has recognised the need to take further action and will continue to work with the search engines and government to build a stronger digital music sector. ""The BPI, together with colleagues from the film industry, will continue to meet with the search engines and government to ensure these measures make a real difference and to persuade Bing and Yahoo to take similar action.""

"As some predicted, it was not a Super Mario game, but ""Miitomo"", an app in which players create their own avatars to talk to each other. The company's share price fell as much as 10 percent on the news. But one analyst said it was a typically cautious and prudent first step into smartphone gaming from Nintendo. Nintendo said that Miitomo would be a ""free-to-start communication application"". Players would create their own Mii avatars, which they could use to chat to other players, it said at a launch event in Tokyo on Thursday. It will also reportedly feature in-app purchases. The features have more in common with a social network than a traditional Nintendo game. Miitomo was designed as an introduction to Nintendo's other, yet to be announced, smartphone gaming efforts, the firm said, adding that it planned to have five apps ready by the end of March 2017. ""Miitomo is exactly in line with how Nintendo should be approaching mobile. It is the ideal toe-dip for the company and its fans,"" said mobile expert Steve Bailey, of IHS Analysis. ""The first thing people did on the Wii and 3DS was to create a personal, social presence. This is Nintendo replicating that for mobile. ""I don't expect it to be a rousing stand-alone success. This is an exploratory effort and one whose role will be complementary to a broader catalogue of games going forward,"" he added. According to the Agence France-Presse news agency, Nintendo's new president Tatsumi Kimishima said the firm needed more time to ""boost the quality"" of its first smartphone offering. After initially dropping 10%, Nintendo's stock price rallied to close 8.97% down at 20,945 yen (£113.46, $173.12). Shares in the mobile gaming company DeNA, with which Nintendo developed the game, fell nearly 15% to 2,080 yen. 'Risk' According to Mr Bailey, investors would be well advised to recognise that Nintendo's strength is its intellectual property, such as the Super Mario series of games. Its track record, he said, suggested that the more popular series will be brought to smartphones once the company has gained experience on the platform. ""Hardware is transitory. Despite any near-term market grumbles, the greatest risk Nintendo faces is diluting that IP. Anyone expecting a Super Mario freemium game before the year is out, will probably need to throttle those hopes,"" he said. ""Nintendo has the potential to carve itself a unique and profitable position on mobile, but the journey there may frustrate those investors expecting immense, immediate success. Having to navigate those expectations while preserving the value of its IP, is going to be the key challenge for Nintendo in mobile."" In a statement, Nintendo said it would ""consider any and all Nintendo IP as candidates for future apps"".","Nintendo has announced its first smartphone 'game', but delayed its launch from the end of the year until next March."
"Parental controls are offered to users to prevent children seeing unsuitable material. Sky customers were most likely to implement the filters and BT customers least likely, Ofcom reported. Some 97% of those who had adopted filters said they were useful. The UK's largest internet service providers (ISPs) are required under a semi-voluntary agreement with the UK government to adopt network-level filtering via a scheme known as Active Choice Plus. Between 30% to 40% of Sky customers enabled filters, Ofcom's report said. That compared to 14% for TalkTalk, 12% for Virgin Media and 6% for BT. Sky automatically enables the feature even if the original request is ignored, which likely explains why it has the highest take-up rate. All ISPs allow users to disable the filters whenever they want. New users were more likely to enable the filters than existing ones, said Ofcom. Responsible children The report also indicated that awareness of ISP content filters had increased among parents of children aged five to 15, from 50% last year to 57% this year. Some 76% of parents said that they knew enough to help their children manage online risks, with the vast majority - 78% - saying that they trusted their children to use the internet safely. Reasons given for not using filters were threefold:","The vast majority of UK internet users are not taking advantage of net censors designed to filter out pornography and other content, according to the communications regulator Ofcom."
"By Dave LeeTechnology reporter, BBC News Facebook's Global Government Requests Report, released on Tuesday for the first time, offered details on official requests from 74 countries. The US made by far the most requests, asking for information on between 20,000 and 21,000 users. UK authorities requested Facebook hand over data on 2,337 users. ""We will continue to be aggressive advocates for greater disclosure,"" Facebook said. ""We hope this report will be useful to our users in the ongoing debate about the proper standards for government requests for user information in official investigations,"" wrote Facebook lawyer Colin Stretch. ""And while we view this compilation as an important first report - it will not be our last."" Unlike other countries, which had an exact figure, the US data was given as a range due to it being forbidden for companies to disclose how many requests they have had. ""In coming reports, we hope to be able to provide even more information about the requests we receive from law enforcement authorities,"" Mr Stretch added. Compliance The report covers the the first six months of 2013, ending 30 June, and is the first time Facebook has released data relating to these kind of requests. The company said it hoped to publish similar reports every six months from now on, and hoped the report highlighted the ""stringent processes"" involved in the obtaining of user information. The company did not give a break-down of why the requests were made, instead just dividing the data by country, outlining how many requests were made, and how many users were involved. Several users could be cited in one request. Facebook also gave a percentage of how often the requests were successful. In the UK, Facebook complied with 68%, while US authorities were successful 79% of the time. Of particular interest were figures for countries affected by civil unrest. In Turkey, 96 requests were made, covering 173 users, of which 45 were complied with - but the firm insisted this was for claims related to ""child endangerment and emergency law enforcement"". No requests made by the Egyptian authorities were complied with, according to the report. 'Terrifying reality' Rights group Privacy International welcomed the publication but had wider concerns. ""Given Facebook's ever-growing presence in the lives of people around the world, we commend them for releasing this report today - a release that has been a long time coming,"" it said. ""However, we are left with a disturbingly hollow feeling regarding Facebook's gesture, and it has little to do with Facebook itself. ""Since documents leaked by Edward Snowden have been published and analysed, the veil has been lifted on what information governments actually collect about us. ""We are now aware of a terrifying reality - that governments don't necessarily need intermediaries like Facebook, Google, and Microsoft to get our data.""

"The proposed rules would have put more responsibility on websites to check for copyright infringements, and forced platforms to pay for linking to news. A slew of high-profile music stars had backed the change, arguing that websites had exploited their content. But opponents said the rules would stifle internet freedom and creativity. The move was intended to bring the EU's copyright laws in line with the digital age, but led to protests from websites and much debate before it was rejected by a margin of 318-278 in the European Parliament on Thursday. What were they voting for? The proposed legislation - known as the Copyright Directive - was an attempt by the EU to modernise its copyright laws, but it contained two highly-contested parts. The first of these, Article 11, was intended to protect newspapers and other outlets from internet giants like Google and Facebook using their material without payment. But it was branded a ""link tax"" by opponents who feared it could lead to problems with sentence fragments being used to link to other news outlets (like this). Article 13 was the other controversial part. It put a greater responsibility on websites to enforce copyright laws, and would have meant that any online platform that allowed users to post text, images, sounds or code would need a way to assess and filter content. The most common way to do this is by using an automated copyright system, but they are expensive. The one YouTube uses cost $60m (£53m), so critics were worried that similar filters would need to be introduced to every website if Article 13 became law. There were also concerns that these copyright filters could effectively ban things like memes and remixes which use some copyrighted material. Stars fail to convince politicians By Mark Savage, music reporter, BBC News The combined clout of Paul McCartney, Annie Lennox, Placido Domingo and David Guetta wasn't enough to persuade MEPs to make sweeping changes to copyright law. They were among 1,300 musicians who urged politicians to enact a law forcing sites like YouTube and Facebook to use filters that would stop users illegally uploading their music. Musicians were being cheated out of money, they argued, even though websites were making huge profits off their work. Critics said the laws would stifle creativity - with Creative Commons chief Ryan Merkley observing that The Beatles would have been prevented from performing cover versions under the proposed rules. For you and me, it could have resulted in text, music and videos posted to blogs, social networks and comment sections being yanked from the net at point of upload - somewhat like YouTube's controversial Content ID system on steroids. In the end, MEPs decided the changes needed more debate; and sent the proposals back to the Commission. The two sides will undoubtedly step up their campaigns in the meantime. What has the reaction been? Opponents of the Copyright Directive celebrated the news that MEPs had rejected it. Julia Reda, a Pirate Party MEP who had campaigned against the changes, tweeted: ""Great success: Your protests have worked! The European Parliament has sent the copyright law back to the drawing board."" Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales told the BBC he hoped that the music industry could find a way to compromise before the September debate. ""Don't think about filtering everything everyone uploads to the internet. That's a pipe dream but you are never going to get that,"" he said. Instead, he added, they should look to renegotiating deals with platforms such as YouTube to get ""fairer remuneration"". BPI Music, which represents UK record labels, had supported the bill and said it would ""work with MEPs over the next weeks to explain how the proposed directive will benefit not just European creativity, but also internet users"".",A controversial overhaul of the EU's copyright law that sparked a fierce debate between internet giants and content creators has been rejected.
"The firm claims it offers ""unlimited access to the mobile internet"", but it charges extra for some services. The digital rights group the Electronic Frontier Foundation told the news website the Daily Dot it thought that would contravene the rules. US authorities barred internet service providers from blocking access or speeding it up for a fee. Jeremy Gillula, the senior technologist at the foundation (EFF), told the Daily Dot that, while the organisation was still in the process of gathering information, ""from what we've read thus far it seems like T-Mobile's new plan to charge its customers extra to not throttle video runs directly afoul of the principle of net neutrality"". 'Unlimited' On Thursday, T-Mobile announced it was to start offering ""unlimited everything - talk, text and high-speed smartphone data"" for a single price, rather than a deal that provides a finite amount of data per month. The firm said the $70 (£53) per month deal, which is named T-Mobile One, was a ""radically simple subscription to the mobile Internet. One low price. Unlimited everything. That's it. It doesn't get any simpler than that"". But it only includes standard definition video and customers wanting high definition need to pay $25 (£19) a month extra. And T-Mobile added that people who use large quantities of data will be placed at a disadvantage compared to those who use less than 26 gigabytes per month and ""may notice relatively slower speeds but only at specific times and places that may experience high, competing network demand or congestion"". It said only three per cent of users were likely to be affected. 'Throttle' According to Mr Gillula, limiting video to standard definition unless a premium is paid risks breaching the US Federal Communications Commission's Open Internet Order, which ""explicitly said that ISPs can't throttle traffic based on its type, or charge customers more in order to avoid discriminatory throttling"". T-Mobile did not respond to a request for comment. US net neutrality rules instituted last year were designed to protect the open internet. They mean that broadband cannot slow down users' connections unless the customer pays more. Nor can the firms strike deals with content companies to prioritise delivery of their material. Matthew Howett, an analyst at Ovum, told the BBC that net neutrality rules in both the US and EU were ""new and generally untested"" and firms were still ""getting to grips with what is acceptable and what isn't"". He said: ""Critically in the US, carriers believe the FCC overstepped the mark by imposing the rules and are likely to be more hostile to them if they are challenged in court. ""Ultimately, a balance needs to be struck between protecting the consumers on one hand and allowing for innovation and investment in networks on the other. ""To some extent, rule makers will be relying on competitive pressures between carriers and the prospect of consumers voting with their feet if they don't like what's on offer."" In January, T-Mobile was accused of breaking net neutrality rules with its video streaming service Binge On. It included unlimited amounts of low-resolution video with partnered firms. But it was claimed that the deal also affected the quality of other providers' videos, even if they were not a partner. T-Mobile's chief executive John Legere posted an expletive-filled response on Twitter; for which he later apologised.","T-Mobile's new ""unlimited"" data plan may breach US net neutrality rules, campaigners have said."
"By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter Called DeepNostalgia, the firm acknowledged that some people might find the feature ""creepy"" while others would consider it ""magical"". It said it did not include speech to avoid the creation of ""deepfake people"". It comes as the UK government considers legislation on deepfake technology. The Law Commission is considering proposals to make it illegal to created deepfake videos without consent. MyHeritage said that it had deliberately not included speech in the feature ""in order to prevent abuse, such as the creation of deepfake videos of living people"". ""This feature is intended for nostalgic use, that is, to bring beloved ancestors back to life,"" it wrote in its FAQs about the new technology. But it also acknowledged that ""some people love the Deep Nostalgia feature and consider it magical, while others find it creepy and dislike it"". ""The results can be controversial, and it's hard to stay indifferent to this technology."" Fake Lincoln Deepfakes are computer-generated AI-driven videos that can be created from existing photos. The technology behind Deep Nostalgia was developed by Israeli firm D-ID. It used artificial intelligence and trained its algorithms on pre-recorded videos of living people moving their faces and gesturing. On the MyHeritage site, historical figures such as Queen Victoria and Florence Nightingale are reanimated. And earlier this month, to mark his birthday, the firm put a video of Abraham Lincoln on YouTube using the technology. The former US president appears in colour and is shown speaking. People have begun posting their own reanimated ancestor videos on Twitter, with mixed responses. Some described the results as ""amazing"" and ""emotional"" while others expressed concern. In December, Channel 4 created a deepfake Queen who delivered an alternative Christmas message, as part of a warning about how the technology could be used to spread fake news.",Genealogy site MyHeritage has introduced a tool which uses deepfake technology to animate the faces in photographs of dead relatives.
"By Paul ColettiBBC News Over recent months the ""cryptocurrency"" has stabilised, however it is still worth less than a quarter of its peak value against the dollar. But while Bitcoin's long-term prospects may remain in doubt, some are suggesting that its underlying technology - the Blockchain - has a bright future. What's their business model? Blockchain businesses take the technology that underpins Bitcoin - the Blockchain - and use it for things the virtual currency's unidentified creator, ""Satoshi Nakamoto"", never envisaged when he first published his system for a ""truly peer-to-peer electronic cash system"". In Bitcoin, the Blockchain is used to store financial transactions. The emerging Blockchain companies believe it can be used for much more. The new projects have been dubbed ""Bitcoin 2.0"" - but some Blockchain evangelists are wary of the term because of negative associations with Bitcoin. OK. So, what is a Blockchain? In Bitcoin the Blockchain is a ledger. Imagine walking into the head office of a bank some 80 years ago. Arranged along shelves are a number of hefty, leather-bound books. You take one down, blow the dust from the cover and open it up. This is the ledger, and each page contains a number of lines, and on each line is listed a transaction: a credit here, a debit there. The Blockchain is simply a representation of this ledger in the form of an ever-expanding computer file. You can think of a block in the Blockchain representing a page in the ledger. Other characteristics of the Blockchain are: The uncoordinated nature of the network is what keeps it honest. To corrupt the system - in other words to hack it - you would have to commandeer more than 50% of the computers on the system. More on this later. This file must get pretty big? It does. ""Blockchain bloat"" is a problem the Bitcoin community is already trying to address. At the time of writing, the current size of the Blockchain is a touch under 36GB. For comparisons sake, that's more storage than many smartphones provide, and enough to fill more than 50 standard CD-Roms. Other than payments, what else can the Blockchain be used for? Just about any kind of data you can think of that is transactional in nature and requires immutability - ie information that absolutely cannot be changed after it has been created. A good example is land titles. Texas-based Factom is working with a Central American client to try to get their system for registering land titles into a Blockchain. According to Factom president Peter Kirby, this country had ""built a database of all their land title records and some bureaucrats got hold of that and they started giving themselves beachfront property"". He added: ""With Blockchain technology, you could create a truly tamper-proof record system. Those land title records can go into the Blockchain in a way that I know if anybody tries to change it."" Other candidates for insertion into the Blockchain include contracts, royalty payments, certificates for authenticating art and even government budgets. Can I look at a Blockchain? Yes you can. You can download the Bitcoin Blockchain at any time and view transactions in near real-time. Alternatively visit www.blockexplorer.com and use its simplified interface. Just type in a random block number to view the transactions contained within that block. That's pretty transparent Sure is. And for many this is the most crucial point of all: the Blockchain lacks a central, controlling authority. With banks, it's the bank that acts as the sole arbiter of the validity of the ledger. With land, it's the officials controlling the registry. Both are examples of what techies are fond of calling a single point of failure. Anti-corruption group Transparency International says there is great potential in a Blockchain's ability to bypass the need for such traditional ""gatekeepers"". ""Corruption appears when you have a monopoly, somebody with discretionality to decide and when you have opacity,"" Alejandro Sales, the body's regional director for the Americas tells the BBC. So, how would I get my government to put its data through a Blockchain? Not so fast. The Blockchain's distributed nature and the ability for anyone in the world with a powerful enough computer to participate is both its strength and weakness. According to the theory, so long as nodes - programs that validate transactions and blocks - don't cooperate to break the system, all goes to plan. But when it comes to putting all this into practice, one Harvard internet law professor thinks he has spotted a flaw. ""Why would we assume that now and forever no one entity could command more than half of the computing power of the people mining a Blockchain?"" asks Prof Jonathan Zittrain. ""I haven't really heard a satisfying answer to that.""","For Bitcoin, 2014 was not a good year. The virtual currency's value slumped as scandal after scandal struck, resulting in many people losing significant amounts of money."
"By Dan MacadamTechnology reporter Retailers offer up a dizzying array of special offers and big discounts, with more deals added online on Cyber Monday. But how can you spot a genuine bargain? 1 Check the size of the discount Before you buy, it is always worth checking if the same product is cheaper somewhere else, experts say. Some specialist sites can tell you if the product has been discounted more heavily before. For example, Camelcamelcamel.com shows the price history of Amazon products - allowing shoppers to see if they have been offered more cheaply in the past. When consumer group Which? looked back on retailers' offers last year, it found only 90 out of 178 deals were cheapest on Black Friday. Danny Munday, general manager of HotUKDeals, a deal-sharing website, said retailers sometimes increase the price of an item before a sales event to make the discount look deeper. Members in online forums will share their knowledge of sale prices and recommended retail prices, he added. 2 Look for price match With competition fierce, retailers are starting to match the deals being offered by their rivals. John Lewis is one of the main companies that does this, but Currys and Amazon also have in the past, said Gary Caffell, deal editor at MoneySavingExpert. ""When people are price matching each other, look at other factors like warranty and delivery fees,"" he said. Electrical goods purchased from John Lewis often have longer warranties, compared with the standard one year. That includes five years on televisions, three years on many own-brand electrical goods and two years on other electrical items. Mr Caffell adds what all the experts agreed with: ""Don't get sucked in by the hype and buy something you don't need or can't afford."" Mike Meade, Director of 360 Voucher Codes, said it was important for customers to do their homework before hitting the high street. He said: ""This is a great time of year for shoppers to make savings, but it's wise to prepare before heading to the shops. ""Checking out deals online has come top of the list for a reason - if you know where the best deals can be found, you know which shops to visit first."" 3 All-store discounts can offer better value Retailers often have deals ""up to"" a big headline percentage, but only some stock will be available at that discount. ""The stronger deals are those which are available across the whole store,"" Mr Caffell said. For example, Gap is offering a 40% discount on full-price items and the Disney Store has 20% off. One thing to be aware of with big Black Friday discounts on certain items is that sometimes they are unwanted stock which is of poor quality, Mr Munday said. It is also worth looking out for extra discount codes on companies' Facebook pages or mailing lists, for example on delivery charges, they said. 4 Know your rights Experts also cautioned that some Black Friday bargains might be non-refundable. ""Online you've got the right to change your mind and take it back, but that's not necessarily the case in-store,"" Mr Caffell said. Research by Which? indicates only 29% of shoppers know that they have more protection when returning goods bought online than in-store. ""It's important to do your research so you know your shopping rights before you buy, just in case you change your mind,"" said Alex Neill, Which? managing director of home and legal. Jo Causon, chief executive of the Institute of Customer Service, said customers are increasingly thinking about the shopping experience and aftercare, not just price. ""If you're having to take things back and it's difficult, that's hardly a bargain,"" she said. 5 Brace for website crashes Once you've found a bargain online, though, you do not want to lose it because the website or app crashes. Sites including John Lewis, Argos and Tesco Direct have struggled with the traffic in previous years. In some cases the websites have crashed but are still available on mobile or tablet, Mr Caffell said. By having a page open across multiple devices, you are better protected from crashes, he said. It also gives you an extra place in online queues, which can be very long. ""The busiest time for people logging on is going to be around midnight and then 08:00 or 09:00 in the morning,"" Mr Caffell said.",Black Friday is now one of the UK's busiest shopping days.
"By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter The trial, which Facebook says has now concluded, aimed to prioritise ""comments that indicate disbelief"". It meant feeds from the BBC, the Economist, the New York Times and the Guardian all began with a comment mentioning the word fake. The test, which was visible only to some users, left many frustrated. The comments appeared on a wide range of stories, from ones that could be fake to ones that were clearly legitimate. The remarks, which would appear at the top of the comments section, came from a variety of people but the one thing that they had in common was the word fake. ""Clearly Facebook is under enormous pressure to tackle the problem of fake news, but to question the veracity of every single story is preposterous,"" said Jen Roberts, a freelance PR consultant. ""Quite the reverse of combating misinformation online, it is compounding the issue by blurring the lines between what is real and what isn't. My Facebook feed has become like some awful Orwellian doublethink experiment."" Many on Twitter also expressed annoyance. In a statement, Facebook told the BBC: ""We're always working on ways to curb the spread of misinformation on our platform, and sometimes run tests to find new ways to do this. This was a small test which has now concluded. ""We wanted to see if prioritising comments that indicate disbelief would help. We're going to keep working to find new ways to help our community make more informed decisions about what they read and share."" Facebook has been under enormous pressure to deal with the issue of fake news since it was singled out as one of the main distribution points for hoax stories during the US presidential election. In August it promised to step up its efforts to fight fake news by sending more suspected false stories to fact-checkers. It also launched a new feature that published alternative news links beneath suspect articles.",A Facebook test that promoted comments containing the word fake to the top of news feeds has been criticised by users.
"By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor The app can only be used to do this in South Korea, but LG said it planned to extend it to the US and other markets at a later date. Samsung has already released air conditioners, fridges and washers that work with its rival Smart Home service. But experts suggest such products may only appeal to a niche audience. ""I'm sure 10 years from now we will want more smart-aware appliances, but for now this represents a live beta-test,"" said Chris Green, principal technology analyst at the Davies Murphy Group consultancy. ""It's the equivalent of Ford building a concept car. It's about showing what can be done and seeing if there's an appetite for it."" Fridge photos LG's HomeChat appliances communicate with their users via Line, a popular chat app in Asia, and are designed to understand natural language requests. The refrigerator features an in-built wide-angle camera that takes a picture of its shelves' contents each time its doors are opened and closed. As a result, one of the requests it can handle is to provide the latest photo so its owner can check if they are missing an item while visiting a shop. In addition, the fridge's Freshness Tracker software can provide information about items that have passed their expiration dates. However, this feature requires the user to have entered details about each product into the fridge when they were placed in it. The washing machine can be remotely activated by texting it a message saying: ""Start washing cycle,"" and real-time updates can be obtained by asking: ""What are you doing?"" And the oven can asked for recipe suggestions and then be instructed to preheat the equipment to the appropriate temperature for the chosen selection. Hacked homes LG suggested text messaging smart appliances offered a ""new level of convenience"". But Mr Green said the examples given sounded ""gimmicky"", adding that what consumers wanted was a greater level of automation rather than a new type of remote control. ""People love the idea of a fridge that reorders goods on its own - but the bottleneck there isn't the fridge manufacturer, it's the grocery providers,"" he said. ""In order for that concept to work, we need the items that we buy to become smarter themselves. They need RFID [radio-frequency identification] tags on them or something else that makes trackable what goes in or out of the fridge and freezer."" In the meantime, manufacturers of such smart devices may need to reassure potential customers about security concerns. Data protection company Proofpoint reported earlier this year that it had discovered an internet-connected fridge had been hacked to send out spam emails. There have also been reports of some smart TVs being vulnerable to hacks that might reveal information about their users' habits. ""It's the classic science-fiction nightmare story of somebody being able to hack in and control your cooker in the night,"" said Dr Joss Wright from the University of Oxford's Internet Institute, ""The more home control that can occur remotely the more chance that somebody can cause very severe mischief if they can get into it.""",A new LG text chat service allows fridge owners to see what food is inside as well as controlling other home appliances from the company.
"Some of the company's older games from the discontinued Wii console will appear on the Nvidia Shield set-top box in China. Historically, Nintendo has rarely licensed its original games and characters to rival console-makers. The Japanese gaming giant does not currently sell its latest console, Nintendo Switch, in China. The video games market in China was valued at $24bn (£18bn) in 2016. However, most people play on PCs or mobile devices, despite China relaxing its rules on the sale of foreign consoles in 2014. Among the Nintendo games being made available on the Nvidia Shield are The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, first released in 2006, and New Super Mario Bros Wii, from 2009. Nintendo has not previously released the games for consoles other than its own devices. However, it has experimented with mobile games such as Super Mario Run and Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp. The Wii titles to be rereleased for the Nvidia Shield will have their graphics upgraded to high-definition and be streamed through Nvidia's Geforce Now platform. ""Nvidia has an established partnership with Nintendo through the supply of its Tegra X1 processor for use in the Switch console. This content deal is an extension of this relationship and offers benefits to both parties,"" said Piers Harding-Rolls, from technology consultancy IHS Markit. ""The deal allows Nintendo to test its older content on the Chinese consumer and to accrue useful data on usage of those games. For Nvidia, it gives the platform some exclusive and well known games content to kick start its sales in the territory.""",Nintendo is to release some of its popular games on a rival manufacturer's console for the first time in decades.
"It was part of a wider operation which raised more than $100,000 through online fundraising platforms, which have suspended linked accounts. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg is due to answer questions from US politicians today, as the platform faces renewed scrutiny over its practices and integrity. The investigation - by CNN's Donie O'Sullivan - raises more awkward questions for the advertising and social media giant, as well as others. Patrisse Khan Cullors, one of the founders of the Black Lives Matter movement, tweeted that they had asked Twitter to remove an associated account. She told CNN that Black Lives Matter had contacted Facebook several months ago to raise concerns about the page, which has twice as many likes as the official page. The page was suspended by Facebook due to an administrator's account being suspended, not apparently for a breach of community standards. It was then taken down by one of its administrators after CNN contacted Ian Mackay, one of the Australian men the news organisation believes is associated with administration of the page. Pointedly, CNN says that ""not for the first time, Facebook took action against a major bad actor on its site not on its own but because journalists made inquiries."" Suspicions about the site date back to 2016, according to O'Sullivan. His report highlights the work of Jeremy Massler, whose blog post in December 2017 first raised the links to Mackay and brought them to the attention of CNN. Separately, Australia's SBS reports that Mackay has been sacked from his role as an official with the National Union of Workers (NUW), along with another unnamed official. Fundraising pages closed The people behind the page also ran multiple fundraising pages on platforms including Donorbox, Paypal, Patreon. It is claimed they raised about A$129,000 ($100,000, £71,000) and that some of the funds had been tied to an Australian bank account, with one fundraiser linked to Mackay by name. When contacted by CNN, Mackay denied running the page, telling them that he had only bought a domain name and had subsequently sold it. By Alex Murray, UGC and Social news","The biggest Facebook page linked to the Black Lives Matter movement was a scam run by a white man in Australia and has been taken down, CNN has reported."
"The latest list by Top 500, published twice a year, puts two US machines - Summit and Sierra - in the top two places. The US has five entries in the top 10, with other entries from Switzerland, Germany and Japan. However, overall China has 227 machines in the top 500, while the US has 109. Summit can process 200,000 trillion calculations per second. Both Summit and Sierra were built by the tech giant IBM. China's Sunway TaihuLight supercomputer, which this time last year was the world's most powerful machine, is now ranked at number three, while the country also has the fourth spot in the list. Sunway TaihuLight has a processing power of 93 petaflops, compared with Summit's 200. It was nudged out of second place by Sierra, which is in the Lawrence Livermore National Lab and has a processing power of 94 petaflops. Supercomputers are typically large, expensive systems featuring tens of thousands of processors designed to carry out specialised calculation-intensive tasks, such as climate change studies, nuclear weapons simulations and weather forecasting.",China has been pushed into third place on a list of the world's most powerful supercomputers.
"By Mark WardTechnology correspondent, BBC News Speed tests in 80 countries revealed wi-fi was left lagging in 33 nations, according to wireless coverage mapping company OpenSignal. Mobile data should also get a further speed boost when 5G networks arrived, it said. Wi-fi remained the fastest way to go online in most countries surveyed, including the UK and Ireland. But OpenSignal noted that because anyone could set up a wi-fi network in a location already used by others, performance could suddenly lag due to ""congestion"" of the airwaves involved. By contrast, mobile networks have to license the spectrum they use, so in theory, the company said, they should deliver a more consistent experience. ""The perception that mobile networks are inferior to wi-fi has persisted, wrongly,"" wrote analyst Ian Fogg in the report. Australians enjoy the greatest advantage over wi-fi, with mobile download speeds being on average 13Mbps faster. Other nations in a similar position included Qatar, France, Mexico, Turkey and South Africa. Places where wi-fi was on average more than twice the speed of mobile data included Hong Kong, the US, Thailand, Israel and Russia. In the UK, wi-fi was about 60% faster than mobile because, said the report, its mature fixed network helped data get to hotspots and on to users quickly. The differences in network speeds were more pronounced when only the latest 4G networks were taken into account. Countdown to 5G In 63% of the 50 nations where 4G was available, mobile networks were quicker, said Mr Fogg. And the gap would only widen once fifth-generation (5G) networks were turned on, because most improvements to wi-fi speeds were set to come from work to upgrade fixed broadband networks, which would take much longer to accomplish. However, another data speed-measuring company cautioned that it could take a while for the benefits to be shared by all. ""The infrastructure deployed for 5G will likely not extend into remote areas,"" Kevin Hasley, head of product at RootMetrics, told the BBC. ""Wi-fi will remain an important tool for the provision of fast internet connections for a segment of the populous."" Even so, OpenSignal said phone-makers needed to ""ensure they do not accidentally push consumers' smartphones on to a wi-fi network with a worse experience than the mobile network"". Technology news site The Register said Huawei now made phones that performed tests to find the fastest network. The report also noted efforts by Samsung to make phones that joined to both wi-fi and mobile networks to send data and boost browsing speeds.","Download speeds across mobile networks are now faster than wi-fi in many countries, research suggests."
"The call for clarity was issued by Michael Chertoff, former head of the US Department of Homeland Security, at the RSA security conference in London. He said the lack of direction was giving the initiative to criminals and hampering co-ordinated responses to the growing number of hi-tech attacks. Countries should be able to defend themselves, he suggested, if an attack posed imminent danger to human lives. ""It's the least understood threat and the one where our doctrine is least developed,"" said Mr Chertoff. Graded response The need for such a doctrine was as pressing now as it was in 1950s, he said, when the emergence of nuclear weapons rendered irrelevant earlier policies governing when and why conflicts were fought. That vacuum was filled by the policy of deterrence which defined what response could be expected from the US depending on how its territory or citizens were threatened. ""It was very clear to an adversary the consequences of an attack,"" he said. In a similar way, said Mr Chertoff, a nation's cyber defence doctrine would lay out a range of responses depending on the severity of the attack. ""We have to treat espionage as different from attack or massive fraud or theft of information,"" he said. Theft and espionage could be dealt with through the legal system, he said, with the strongest responses being reserved for the most serious cases. ""If you cause imminent danger of loss of life by attacking a network that's a different story,"" he said. ""Theft is bad but murder is worse."" International laws of self-defence would allow a nation to respond to remove the threat posed by an imminent or unfolding attack, he said. He admitted that such serious attacks on national infrastructure, such as rolling blackouts that led to deaths in hospitals, had not happened yet, but added: ""I would not like to experience the first one."" ""There seem to be very few entities that are perfectly immune from these types of attacks,"" said Mr Chertoff who now heads the Chertoff Group, which advises nations and governments on risks and security. By defining a doctrine, he suggested, all nations would be encouraged to police domestic networks better to avoid incurring a strong response. ""The greatest stress you can have on security is when there is uncertainty,"" he said. ""We are now in a state of uncertainty."" The need to develop response scenarios and an over-arching doctrine was becoming pressing, he said, as those involved in hacking for money carried out ever more attacks. ""It's a real problem and it's growing,"" he said, ""If we do not address it then we are going to be confronted by an event that's so catastrophic that it cannot be shrugged off.""",Nations need to define the rules of engagement for acts of cyber terror.
"The Lime Group, which developed the Limewire system, has agreed to pay $105m (£64.6m) to 13 music firms. The figure is far less than the billion dollar bill for damages that the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) claimed it was owed. The prolonged legal fight has led to Limewire being shut down. Mitch Bainwol, chairman of the RIAA - which represents record labels - said the organisation was pleased with the result. ""This hard fought victory is reason for celebration by the entire music community, its fans and the legal services that play by the rules,"" said Mr Bainwol in a statement. Limewire was a program that used peer-to-peer technology to help people find media on other computers and let others see their libraries of files. The RIAA first took legal action against Limewire in 2006 shortly after concluding a $115m settlement with peer-to-peer software maker Kazaa. In May 2010, the judge overseeing the case ruled that Limewire and its creator Mark Gorton had infringed copyright and aided others in downloading pirated music. Another court ruling in the case in October 2010 led to the effective closure of Limewire as it was banned from letting people search, download, upload or trade files using the program. An official updated version of the program has been distributed that stops people using Limewire to swap files in this way. However, a pirate edition has been produced that leaves those services intact.",File-sharing software company Limewire has reached an out of court settlement with record labels that sued it for helping people pirate music.
"By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter And what everyone wanted to know was: ""How do I get that filter?"" Some asked if it was utilising deepfake technology because the filter seemed sophisticated. But it is a decades-old piece of software pre-installed on some Dell laptops. The Live Cam Avatar software was also available for people to download. It is not clear how the lawyer found himself speaking through the face of a worried-looking cat . But it seems even in its heyday, there was a history of people becoming trapped as the avatar and finding it hard to remove. 'Frantically scrolling' One, ChemBark, describes in a blog how he appeared ""as a sad kitten"" during a job interview via Skype. ""I started frantically scrolling down all of the menus in Skype, trying to remedy the situation,"" he writes. Tweeting now the filter is back in the news, he says it ""was the default setting on Dell's webcam software"". Another blog, written in 2010, offers a detailed explanation of how to remove ""the stupid white cat"". The company behind the filter, Reallusion, described it as a ""customisable emotive facial animation that gives you much more fun that the conventional video chatting"". Reallusion now provides sophisticated real-time 3D animation software - but the cat filter seems no longer to be available in its online shop. Cat lawyer? There are other ways to access cat filters, though. Snapchat app Snap Camera can be integrated with Zoom. And Zoom has its own filters, as well as allowing people to integrate ones from third parties. Last year, a Pakistani politician's livestreamed press conference descended into farce when he switched a cat filter on by mistake.

"By Chris BaraniukTechnology reporter Kodi is a free, legal media player for computers - but software add-ons can make it possible to download pirated content. The Complete Guide to Kodi magazine instructs readers on how to download such add-ons. Dennis Publishing has not yet responded to a BBC request for comment. The magazine is available at a number of retailers including WH Smith, Waterstones and Amazon. It was spotted on sale by cyber-security researcher Kevin Beaumont. It repeatedly warns readers of the dangers of accessing pirated content online, but one article lists a series of software packages alongside screenshots promoting ""free TV"", ""popular albums"" and ""world sport"". ""Check before you stream and use them at your own risk,"" the guide says, before adding that readers should stay ""on the right side of the law"". Police discussions A spokesman for Fact said the body was working with the City of London Police's Intellectual Property Crime Unit (Pipcu) as it made enquiries. ""We are fully aware of this magazine and have already been in communication with Dennis Publishing regarding our concerns that it signposts consumers to copyright-infringing add-ons,"" said Kieron Sharp, chief executive of Fact. ""It is concerning that the magazine's content provides information to consumers on add-ons that would potentially allow criminality to take place,"" he added. In April, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled that selling devices pre-configured with add-ons allowing access to pirated content is illegal, and that streaming such content was also against the law. Two of the add-ons listed in the article are on a banned list maintained by the Kodi developers. ""We don't support piracy add-ons and so we don't like the idea of someone selling a magazine encouraging people to use them,"" said Nate Betzen, Kodi's community and project manager. ""I am a bit surprised anyone is still selling a magazine like this physically, given all the lawsuits and the recent EU court decision,"" he added. WH Smith declined to comment but the BBC understands that the newsagent has no plans to stop sales of the magazine. In February, it was reported that five people had been arrested and accused of selling set-top boxes with modified versions of Kodi allowing them to stream subscription football matches, TV channels and films for free.","A British magazine is directing readers to copyright-infringing software, the Federation Against Copyright Theft (Fact) has said."

Both channels have more than 73 million subscribers, with PewDiePie currently in the lead by about 300,000. T-Series shares Bollywood film trailers and music videos, while PewDiePie posts video game commentaries and vlogs. The anonymous printer hacker, going by the name Hacker Giraffe, said they had identified 800,000 printers with open security settings and selected 50,000 to print out support for PewDiePie. The vulnerability could have been used to cause ""major havoc"", the hacker told technology news website The Verge. ""Hackers could have stolen files, installed malware, caused physical damage to the printers and even used the printer as a foothold into the inner network,"" they said. ""The most horrifying part is I never considered hacking printers before, the whole learning, downloading and scripting process took no more than 30 minutes."" Other YouTubers, including Mr Beast and Markiplier, who between them have 33 million subscribers, have also made videos urging their followers to subscribe to PewDiePie. In a video he posted himself about the fight to retain his crown, PewDiePie - whose real name is Felix Kjellberg - said he was enjoying the support. ""All of this support to keep me on top is so funny. I love it. Please keep it up,"" he said. ""But don't do anything illegal OK... because that will look bad on me."" According to the website Social Blade, PewDiePie is gaining an average of 144,656 subscribers per day while T-Series is averaging 157,656. T-Series has not posted anything about the situation but it has been described by some observers as a David versus Goliath battle.

"Police in Sydney found imitation weapons after searching the home of Sicen Sun, 27. Mr Sun's solicitor said his client had a ""fanboy relationship"" with science fiction and police-themed TV programmes, according to ABC News. He has been charged with offences relating to the making of firearms. ""Police located and seized four imitation pistols, including a 3D-manufactured small Glock, a 3D-manufactured Glock, a 3D-manufactured Sig 250, two air pistols, computer equipment, and two 3D printers,"" a New South Wales Police Force statement read.

""He is captured by provisions clearly designed to target more serious activity."" Mr Keane added that his client was particularly fond of the video game Call of Duty and the TV programme NCIS, according to the Daily Telegraph. However, prosecutors argued that saying the accused was a science-fiction fan or a ""nerd"" was not enough on its own to justify a release. ABC News also reports that police say they were tipped off after Mr Sun allegedly attempted to sell a gun via social media. Bail was granted on the condition that Mr Sun surrender his Australian and Chinese passports and report to a police station once a week.

"By Dave LeeTechnology reporter, BBC News A scar, half an inch wide, stretched from just above the elbow and up over his shoulder. ""Our company paid for full medical expenses, so he had an operation,"" explained his coach, Kang Doh Kyung. ""[He] is the best player in StarCraft and has won everything in this field and is still going strong."" Repetitive strain had injured Mr Lee's muscles, deforming them and making surgery the only option to save his illustrious career. Holding his arm out so I could have a proper gawp, Mr Lee paused. ""It's like a badge of honour,"" he said. It seemed like the confirmation I'd been expecting - that gaming in South Korea had reached a dangerous place, where professionals and amateurs alike were destroying their lives and their bodies. But Mr Kang sees it very differently. They're athletes, he argues, and injuries happen. One of his colleagues later suggested that if I'd been interviewing the world's most-decorated marathon champion, I wouldn't be surprised if they had damaged knees. Nor would I suggest a footballer needing surgery was ""too far"", the phrase I'd used to describe Mr Lee's arm. He had a point. Tap-tap-tap-tap Professional gaming - e-sport - is a huge deal in South Korea. There's a government department dedicated to its development. These gamers are like professional footballers, their matches broadcast - on TV and online - in English as well as Korean. The best earn hundreds of thousands of pounds every year: a mixture of salaries, prize money and sponsorship deals. Mr Lee is a Starcraft player for KT Rolster, one of South Korea's bigger teams. The scar is a result of being at the top of his game for 10 years. Read more stories from the South Korea Direct season: Whatever happened to Psy and K-pop's bid to conquer the world? The woman who liberated Korean housewives In Pictures: Fish, fruit and veg in South Korea's markets How good are Kim Jong-un's hackers? On the day I visited, KT Rolster's Starcraft players were training hard to be just like Mr Lee. The noise of their practice produced an almost hypnotic tap-tap-tap-tap backing track in a room which resembled the kind of place you'd be subjected to when sitting a computer-based exam. Each PC in its own cubicle, gamers with their headphones on, the room screamed ""do not disturb"". The difference here is that these cubicles feel lived in. Family pictures, the remains of snacks, and the odd toothbrush. And then there's the gifts. A lot of gifts. The professional gamers are overwhelmingly male, but their most-obsessive fans are female, lavishing the boys with the kind of attention otherwise reserved for the singing K-Pop stars, the country's other booming entertainment export. But unlike the fad of Gangnam Style, e-sports is something South Korea feels it can bring to the world. ""I believe that e-sport has plenty of potential [to be regarded as a proper sport], although perhaps not as much as physical games,"" Mr Kang said. ""E-sports is in the process of becoming a mental sport like chess."" 'They're adorable' Down the hallway - and past a room filled with bottles of ""sports"" drink Pocari Sweat, another sponsor - I found the training room for KT Rolster's League of Legends team. League of Legends - LoL - is arguably the biggest of the e-sports titles and is all about teamwork and group strategy. The team here joked about going out and drinking beer - and teased about who got the most, and the least, gifts. As well as training together, the teams live together in some digs a short walk from the training office. I'd expected a room full of gadgets and other technology. These are big gamers, after all. But no - aside from a TV, there was very little in the way of gaming entertainment. Here, their charming housekeeper holds fort, and does what she can to keep the team healthy. ""They spend most of their time sitting with little exercise,"" she said, while washing up, ""so I wanted to avoid cooking high-calorie foods, but they love naughty foods like that."" She loves them, she told me. ""They're adorable."" All-night addiction At the top-end of gaming, the players are undeniably well looked after, healthy and happy - even if the gruelling routine means they clearly don't enjoy playing anymore. It's work. But for the non-professional, the impact heavy gaming is having on the health and social lives of young Koreans is of great concern to many. After visiting KT Rolster, I went to another part of Seoul to visit what is known as a PC Bang. They're all over South Korea - internet cafes, essentially, but with high-end gaming PCs. Hundreds of them, in a big room kitted out like a club - with its own bar. It's open 24 hours a day. There have been a number of instances where gamers have died in these PC Bangs. They are rare, but make global headlines. South Korea has made numerous attempts to curb the amount of online gaming its young are playing. In 2011, it passed the Shutdown Law - dubbed the Cinderella Law - which prevented children aged 16 or below from playing online games between 10:30pm and 6:00am. The rules were later amended to allow parents to make their own choice about when gaming access should be curtailed in the home. The country is the world leader in treatment for all sorts of technology dependency, but gaming is, by far, the most common issue. It's one that has parents literally dragging their children to addiction centres set up all over South Korea. At KT Rolster, coach Mr Kang is responsible for looking after his team's wellbeing - but he also recognised the negativity around hardcore gaming. ""When people immerse themselves in something and become addicted to it, then they can cross the line. ""Our bodies might be very tired or in poor condition. These things happen not only while playing games. Even when people work out, some people can have a heart attack."" He stopped, keen to move on from what he saw as a predictable, perhaps tedious, line of questioning. During my time with KT Rolster my point of view flip-flopped between seeing gaming as either serious business, or a serious problem. With the relentless tap-tap-tap of keyboards still echoing in my ears, I came to the only reasonable conclusion I could: it's both.

"Dave LeeNorth America technology reporter The value of Bitcoin is currently extremely volatile, but at the time of writing, the amount stolen was worth approximately $80m. The hacked service was NiceHash, a Slovenia-based mining exchange. It said it was working hard to recover the Bitcoin for its users, adding: ""Someone really wanted to bring us down."" The attack happened early on Wednesday, said NiceHash's chief executive Marko Kobal. Attackers accessed the company's systems at 01:18 CET (00:18 GMT). By 03:37 the hackers, whom the company believes were based outside the European Union, had begun stealing Bitcoin. The theft comes as the price of Bitcoin continues to surge, dumbfounding experts and stoking concerns of a bubble. High-stakes attacks like this are not uncommon, with several large breaches and thefts hitting Bitcoin and other related services over the past year. NiceHash is a mining service, a company that pairs up people with spare computing power with those willing to pay to use it to mine for new Bitcoin. 'Forensic analysis' Mr Kobal appeared on Facebook Live to address concerns about the hack. ""We have not abandoned you guys,"" he said. He explained that an employee's computer was compromised in the attack. He added that ""forensic analysis"" involving local and international authorities was taking place, but did not expand on which specific agencies were involved when asked by the BBC. The company was heavily criticised by its users who commented in droves on Facebook. Communications were complicated further when a spoof Facebook page for the company was set up and spreading disinformation about the breach.

"By Elyse BettersTechnology reporter, New York Sandwiched among old consoles in a second-hand video games shop is a vibrant box with a machine inside that was meant to change the world… and play 3D Tetris. Released in 1994 by Nintendo, Virtual Boy was the first games console marketed with out-of-the-box VR for a relatively-affordable $180 (£115). It proved to be a dud. Gamers complained about the lack of motion tracking - the ability to match the view to movements of the player's head - and even headaches from the graphics which could only be shown in red. Despite being launched at the forefront of a VR-mania, it vanished - like the craze - amid unrealistic expectations. ""In the 80s and 90s there was so much hype we had to do expectation management,"" says Scott Fisher. He is founding chairman of the Interactive Media Division at the University of Southern California's School of Cinematic Arts and previously worked at Atari and Nasa. ""What's frustrating now that VR's a hot topic again is that we're seeing a lot of reinventing the wheel. There's good research [already] out there. It's been around for years."" Slow start Imagine being Paul McCartney, walking out on stage at the height of Beatlemania - that was the promise of virtual reality: the ability to be whoever and do whatever you wanted. The only limit would be the software designer's imagination. But in practice the ""reality"" offered looked very different to real life, and proved awkward to operate. From eye-piece-like consoles to arcade pods, VR rigs were cumbersome and expensive. The technology can be traced back to 1962 and the launch of the Sensorama - a stereoscopic 3D movie booth, called an ""experience theatre"" into which viewers placed their head to be transported ""into another world"". Four years later the US Air Force developed its first computer-controlled flight simulator. That was followed in 1968 by a head-mounted display developed by a Harvard University professor which showed wire-frame graphics that moved as the wearer turned their head. The term ""virtual reality"" itself was made popular by California-based technologist Jaron Lanier who founded VPL Research in 1984 - a firm which made early VR headsets and data-gloves. Among buyers of the kit was Nasa, where a researcher adapted it to be used as a control system for later Mars Rover pilots. But it wasn't until the early-90s that VR really hit the mainstream. Movies including The Lawnmower Man, Virtuosity and Johnny Mnemonic and novels such as Neal Stephenson's Snow Crash and Michael Crichton's Disclosure entranced the public with the promise of immersive computer-created worlds. Start-ups capitalised on the opportunity, trying to create kit that would let the public visit cyberspace. But the phenomenon was short-lived - and mostly limited to video games arcades - as the firms struggled to match the quality of the graphics depicted in fiction, failed to agree on a standard format, and put off customers with high prices. ""With consumers, VR hasn't been successful. But it's a success for industry,"" says Mr Lanier. ""Every car company and boat builder uses VR to build vehicles. But there's still no place for consumers to try VR."" Consumer VR is often disappointing: it's expensive to develop, and there are technical limitations on hardware, processors and resolution. ""Thirty years ago we didn't have real-time graphics to keep up with head or body motion,"" Mr Fisher says. ""People would get sim-sick because of lag."" Computing power has now had a chance to catch up. Moore's Law states that the number of transistors on a chip will double approximately every two years. So processors should now be more than 1,000 times more powerful than in 1993. Yet VR systems remain outside most consumers' budgets. Even so, some of the related technologies have worked their way into homes. Mr Lanier helped develop the Xbox's original Kinect motion-tracker, something he describes as one of the ""baby steps of bringing VR to consumers"". The motion-tracking technologies used by Nintendo's Wii consoles also had their roots in VR - but Mr Lanier admits the products aren't ""great"". ""There's nothing you can do to make the stuff cheaper,"" he adds. ""It's happening as fast as it can."" The big hope on the horizon for the games industry is Oculus VR, a California-based firm which raised $2.4m via crowdfunding site Kickstarter to develop a VR headset. ""Virtual reality got featured in movies, TV shows, games, and books as a kind of holy grail technology about to change the world,"" Palmer Luckey, the firm's founder tells the BBC. ""Unrealistic portrayals led to lots of hyperbolic media coverage, further bolstering the public perception that (VR) was more advanced. ""[But] computers are finally powerful enough to render realistic virtual worlds at high frame rates, and the mobile phone industry has massively improved the price, size, and performance of display and sensor technologies. ""We may be a long way from making virtual reality perfect, but what exists today is still an experience far beyond what any game can do with a TV."" Even so, it will take more tech advances to succeed. Part of the reason the Virtual Boy failed was because it was launched with just three games under its belt. ""To succeed among consumers there needs to be software, games - all of it,"" Mr Fisher says. ""That's important."" And not everyone believes VR is finally at its breakthrough moment. ""Every few years there's some entrepreneur,"" says Mr Lanier. ""There've been things like Oculus [before]. ""They're cute and remind me so much of myself when I was a kid… I just don't know if they'll make it.""","Virtual reality was all the rage a couple of decades ago and looked as if it could become the video games industry's next big thing. But despite public interest and millions of dollars of research, the concept flopped. Now, with excitement building for the release of a new VR helmet - the Oculus Rift - it is worth asking what went wrong the first time round, and can any lessons be learned?"
"By Chris FoxTechnology reporter Since December, BT's contracts have stated that the company retains ownership of the wi-fi routers and TV set-top boxes it sends to customers. The company told the Financial Times that it would ""refurbish"" the returned equipment so that it could be reused. Rival Virgin Media already operates a similar policy. BT told the BBC the change would eventually apply to its EE and Plusnet subsidiaries too. It will charge customers between £43 and £50 if they want to keep their router, depending on the model. Keeping the BT YouView set-top box will cost between £60 and £115. It has not reduced its monthly subscription charges as a result of the change, but it said customers would not be charged up-front for a router or TV box. Customers will be sent a padded envelope to return their router to BT. They will also be able to drop off equipment at a BT and EE shop on the high street. The company said any previous customer who still has an old BT router lying around is welcome to return it. The company estimates that the change will stop a million set-top boxes and routers a year being thrown away. ""This will help to limit the amount of waste going into landfill, and allows us to refurbish more equipment and move towards a more sustainable model,"" the company said. Like many broadband providers, BT ""locks"" its routers to its network, so they cannot be used with rival broadband services. ""It would surely be even more environmentally friendly if the devices allowed you to use them with other broadband services,"" cyber-security expert Graham Cluley told the BBC. ""That way they wouldn't need to be sent back to BT."" BT told the BBC that its routers were locked to its network so that it could control software security updates and offer better customer support.","Broadband provider BT will charge new customers up to £50 if they do not send their router back at the end of their contract, in an effort to reduce waste."
"The average rise would be 4%, it said. That is 13 times higher than the current consumer-price-inflation rate. It plans to invest £1bn in its network this year. Virgin did not raise prices as normal in 2020, citing pandemic-related difficulties for customers. Other internet providers are expected to announce similar - or larger - inflation-beating increases soon. For example, BT changed its terms and conditions last year to say it would increase broadband prices by 3.9% above the first CPI rate published every year, which this year is due in 16 days. BT's sister companies, EE and Plusnet, followed suit. And that means their prices are likely to rise by an even higher percentage than Virgin's. The most recent CPI rate - covering the month of November - was 0.3%, the lowest since 2016. If it stayed at the same level for December, BT's prices will rise by 4.2% under its new rules, which it has confirmed it plans to stick with. Billion-pound investments Virgin Media said it was writing to or emailing all its customers to let them know how the increases would affect them. It said most would see their bill go up by between £2.50 and £4.50 a month, which is £30-£54 a year. The 4% average rise works out at £3.63 a month, about 12p a day. The increases will come into effect on 1 March - but they will not affect vulnerable customers, such as those on a special package for universal credit recipients. ""Changing prices is never an easy decision, which is why, unlike other providers, this is our first cable price change in 18 months,"" a spokesman said. He said the company had seen unprecedented demand since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. ""Over the last year our customers have used their connectivity more than ever before, with data use increasing at the fastest rate we've ever seen,"" he said. Way out Plusnet also confirmed it planned to press ahead with the new CPI-plus-3.9% rule, though it will hold off until June to do so. But not every internet provider uses this system. While others have yet to formally announce price increases, many do so on an annual basis, and usually at a rate above inflation. Sky, for example, increased prices by up to 10% last year, with different price increases for different services, amounting to £1-£2 a month extra per service. But rules from the UK's broadband regulator, Ofcom, mean those unhappy with any provider's price increases can leave their contracts early without a penalty. Natalie Hitchins, from the consumer watchdog Which, said that while investment in broadband infrastructure is a good thing, ""this price-hike will sting"". ""Customers should do some research to see if there are better deals on the market and if there are, they should consider switching,"" she said. Anyone wanting to end their contract early will need to inform their provider within 30 days of receiving a message about the change in tariff.","Virgin Media is alerting customers to forthcoming price increases for its broadband, TV and phone services."
"Tencent-owned Tiantian Kuaibao - which means ""fast daily news"" - was accused of spreading ""vulgar, negative and harmful information, which damaged the online environment"". The Cyberspace Administration of China added that it had ""cleaned up"" nearly 9,382 apps and closed 733 websites over the past six months. Tencent has not commented. But this is not the first time its newsfeed service has fallen foul of the authorities. Last April, the app was temporarily removed from several Android stores in China, alongside three other news services, after the CAC ordered them to make changes to the content they were delivering. Shenzhen-based Tencent has, however, been more vocal this week about its efforts to combat misinformation on its WeChat platform, which is China's biggest social network, with 1.1 billion monthly active users. On Monday, it announced that a myth-busting initiative had been used by 295 million users last year. The effort corrects false rumours circulating on the platform, including the claim that onions could be used to ward off the flu virus. However, the company appears to have a tricky relationship with one of China's other regulators. The State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television ended a 10-month-long freeze on video-games approvals in December. But, despite it having given the green light to the release of nearly 260 games over recent weeks, Tencent - the country's biggest publisher - has yet to have any of its titles approved. The issue has meant it has been unable to provide an update to the hit battle-royal game PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG), which would allow it to start monetising the title.",One of China's leading news apps has been singled out for criticism by the country's internet watchdog.
"By Jen CopestakeTechnology reporter The Intercept, which revealed the existence of Project Dragonfly in August, says Google has been ""forced to shut down a data analysis system it was using"" to feed the project. And access to data ""integral to Dragonfly... has been suspended for now, which has stopped progress"". Google said it had no immediate plans to launch a Chinese search engine. What is The Intercept reporting? Citing internal Google documents and inside sources, the Intercept says Project Dragonfly began in the spring of 2017 and accelerated in December after Google's chief executive, Sundar Pichai, met a Chinese government official. An Android app with versions called Maotai and Longfei were developed and could be launched within nine months if Chinese government approved, it says. Using a tool called BeaconTower to check if users' search queries on Beijing-based website 265.com would fall foul of China's censors, Google engineers came up with a list of thousands of banned websites, including the BBC and Wikipedia, which could then be purged from the Dragonfly search engine. But members of Google's privacy team confronted the Dragonfly project managers, saying the system had ""been kept secret from them"". And after several discussions, ""Google engineers were told that they were no longer permitted to continue using the 265.com data to help develop Dragonfly, which has since had severe consequences for the project"". What are the issues with launching a search engine in China? The so-called great firewall of China is notorious for not allowing its citizens free access to all the content available on the internet. China has in the past two years imposed increasingly strict rules on foreign companies, including new censorship restrictions. Some Western sites are blocked outright, including Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. Certain topics such as the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989 are also completely blocked. References to political opposition, dissidents and anti-Communist activity are also banned as are those to free speech and sex. Any search engine in China would have to comply with the Chinese government's strict rules on censorship. Analysis by Dave Lee, BBC North America technology reporter Even with this news today, I don't think Google's ambitions in China are over - just stalled. Sundar Pichai has clearly decided that China is too important (and lucrative) a market to pass up and so, while Dragonfly has met a significant bump in the road - thanks to its own privacy team, the company will almost certainly find a new approach to serving the Chinese market. But in doing so it might do serious harm to its brand. Now more than ever, US technology companies are under pressure to act in the interests of both America and Americans. Bowing to Beijing's demands with whatever Project Dragonfly morphs into will be a stain on Google's principles and its reputation. How advanced were the plans? We learned from Mr Pichai's recent appearance on Capitol Hill that more than 100 engineers had been working on the project at one point in time. When quizzed by lawmakers on the plans, he said: ""Right now, we have no plans to launch in China."" He said all efforts were ""internal"" and did not currently involve discussions with the Chinese government. In response to further questions, Mr Pichai said the company would be ""fully transparent"" with politicians if it released a search service in China. The BBC understands Project Dragonfly never reached the point of having a full and final privacy review by Google. A letter from more than 300 Google employees in November, co-signed by Amnesty International, asked the company to halt the project entirely. Why does Google want to get back into China? Quite simply, China is the biggest internet market in the world. Google launched a search engine in the authoritarian state in 2006, google.cn. Google was compliant with the Chinese government's censorship requirements at the time but the search company pulled the plug in 2010, citing increasing concerns about cyber-attacks on activists. Despite its main search engine and YouTube video platform being blocked, Google still has more than 700 employees and three offices in China and has been developing alternative projects. Its Google Translate app for smartphones was approved in China last year. It also invested in Chinese live-stream game platform Chushou in January and has launched an artificial intelligence game on the social media app WeChat.","Google has reportedly ""effectively ended"" plans for a censored search engine in China."
"The Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) is proposing a test to identify ""culturally British"" games and animation which would qualify for the break. Producers of ""high-end television"" are also included in the scheme. The idea is based on an existing system already in place for the film industry. The DCMS says the definition of ""high-end television"" is still being finalised but is likely to include productions which cost upwards of £1m per hour to make. By applying the test, points would be awarded to games and productions giving them a ""cultural value"" score. Those qualifying would be eligible for tax breaks - under the film scheme productions with a budget of £20m or less can apply for a 25% rebate on any expenditure deemed eligible for tax relief. The deadline for responses is 29 October. ""The government is committed to supporting these creative and dynamic sectors by introducing tax reliefs for these industries,"" said Creative Industry Minister Ed Vaisey. ""The film tax relief has been a huge success and I encourage all those with a vested interest in the animation, high-end television and video games industries to take part in this exercise, and make sure your views are known."" Chancellor George Osborne announced the plans for tax break in the March Budget, with a view to introducing it in April 2013. At the time Richard Wilson, chief executive of video games industry trade body Tiga, said it was a ""brilliant decision"". In 2011 the government announced that the tax relief scheme for the film industry would be continued until 2015. Eligible films must be released in the UK, with 25% of their production costs spent in the country.",The government has begun a consultation over its plans to introduce corporation tax breaks for the animation and video games industries in 2013.
"The US firm says the Google+ Pages facility will help companies and campaigns engage with their audience. Organisations will not be charged to use the scheme and Google says it will not put adverts on their pages. It is a further challenge to rival network Facebook, which offers its own Pages service allowing businesses to promote themselves. Burberry, Barcelona football club and the Muppets are some of the organisations taking part in the launch. Google says the service offers more than a shop window. It says organisations can benefit from adding a ""+"" link to one of the adverts listed on the firm's results or to another marketing campaign. The page owners can then monitor how many people are clicking through to their Google+ page and where they clicked from. However, Google says it will not pass on individual IP addresses or any other personal data. Organisations will be able to use the site's Circles facility to match different information to different groups. They can also set up video chats with up to nine other users using the network's Hangouts service. ""Companies like being on social networks, it allows them to have a two-way conversation with their customers and get to know more about who they are,"" said Professor Jeremy Baker from the ESCP Europe Business School. ""It's a very persuasive and intimate atmosphere as the sites are seen as trusted places to be."" Google says more than 40 million people have already opened an account with its network ""Facebook still has more than 10 times the number of users,"" said Ian Maude, head of internet at Enders Analysis. ""Google+ is growing very quickly. However, there is an awful long way for it to go before it becomes a major threat to Mark Zuckerberg's business.""",Google has started allowing businesses and brands to set up their own pages on its new social network.
"Called Black Mesa, the resurrected game will be made available as a free download on 14 September. The update has been put together using programming tools released by Half-Life creator Valve. It will have improved graphics, better physics and environmental effects and a tweaked story line. News about the long-awaited update broke at the weekend when a countdown timer appeared on the Black Mesa project webpage. A forum message posted soon after revealed that eager players would not get an improved version of the entire game on 14 September. Carlos Montero, leader of the 40-strong Black Mesa development team, said it decided to release a shorter version instead of making people wait longer for the whole thing. Alien intrusion The large chunk of Half-Life that is finished lets players guide hero Gordon Freeman to a section of the original gameplay known as Lambda Core. Finishing this first chunk should take players between eight to 10 hours. The final section yet to be finished takes place in the alien Xen dimension. An expanded Xen section would be released at an unnamed date in the future, said the team. First person shooter Half-Life was released in 1998 and gave players the task of guiding government scientist Gordon Freeman through the Black Mesa research complex battling aliens and thwarting their attempt to invade Earth. The game has been hugely influential since its release. Half-Life creator Valve released an updated version of the game in 2004 that was built around its Source game code or engine. That official update of Half-Life was generally regarded as unsatisfactory and led to the Black Mesa project which aimed to do a better job. The project uses an updated version of Source which leads to improvements in physics, lighting and allows for far more subtlety in the facial expressions of characters. The Black Mesa team has also edited the storyline to beef up the more engaging parts of the game and eliminate the slower parts.","After eight years of work, fans are about to release an updated and expanded version of classic video game Half-Life."
"By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter So it will come as little surprise that it is now addressing one of the biggest issues of all - ageing. It has formed a company named Calico, which will be led by Apple chairman Arthur Levinson. Google co-founder Larry Page said it would focus on ""health and wellbeing, in particular the challenge of ageing and associated diseases"". Moonshot thinking There were few details about how the firm would tackle the issues, but experts think that it is likely that it will use Google's vast databases to search for solutions. ""Google is exceptionally well placed to get involved through their understanding of consumer activity in the delta between big data and information,"" said Ovum analyst Joe Dignan. Mr Page has high ambitions for the spin-off. ""Illness and ageing affect all our families. With some longer term, moonshot thinking around healthcare and biotechnology, I believe we can improve millions of lives,"" he said in a blog post. Increasingly big data is being used to help ""solve"" health issues. Information management firm EMC is heavily involved in healthcare, using data analytics to predict, for example, who may be more prone to getting MRSA. ""There is a focus on big data now. It is about changing the current model of healthcare to a wellness model by combining genomic data [information about DNA] with clinical data to give personalised medical care,"" said Chris Roche, EMC's chief technology officer for big data. In an interview with Time magazine, Mr Page questioned whether current scientific enquiry was focused in the right direction. He said he found it surprising that finding a cure for cancer would only add three years to average life expectancy. ""When you really take a step back and look at it, yeah, there are many, many tragic cases of cancer, and it's very, very sad - but in the aggregate, it's not as big an advance as you might think."" Crazy ones He himself has had health issues. He revealed in May he had been diagnosed with vocal cord paralysis, a nerve condition that affects his ability to speak. Meanwhile co-founder Sergey Brin has been funding research into Parkinson's disease since he learnt in 2008 that he has a flawed gene that means that he has a 50% chance of getting the disease. So far he has donated $132m (£82m) to help create a DNA database of 7,000 patients and to support work on treatments for the condition. Some may raise an eyebrow that Google has chosen rival Apple's chairman Arthur Levinson to head up Calico but chief executive Tim Cook had no such concerns. ""For too many of our friends and family, life has been cut short or the quality of their life is too often lacking. Art is one of the crazy ones who thinks it doesn't have to be this way. There is no one better suited to lead this mission and I am excited to see the results,"" he said in a statement.","Google has a history of left-field projects, from self-drive cars to weather balloons."
"By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter That would include autonomous cars, innovative ways to collect rubbish and shared spaces for communities to come together in new ways. Sidewalk Labs, a sister company to Google, had earmarked disused land in Toronto, Canada for this bold urban experiment, which it hoped would become a model for other cities around the world. The fact that it would be collecting a lot of data from sensors placed all around the harbourside development unsettled some. Now many are asking whether a private firm should take charge of urban improvement at all. Radical mix The project was announced to much fanfare in 2017 and the partnership between Sidewalk Labs and Toronto Waterfront, the agency charged with revitalising the area, promised great things. Led by Dan Doctoroff, ex-deputy mayor of New York, working with a team of both government and digital experts, Sidewalk Labs promised a radical mix of offices, retail and makerspaces with a green agenda, robots and underground waste disposal. It would be, said Mr Doctoroff, a happy place to live. Mr Doctoroff was due to speak at the TED conference, hosted on the other side of Canada in Vancouver, in April. He cancelled his appearance at short notice. Meanwhile, back in Toronto, a group of citizens called Block Sidewalk held its inaugural meeting. And none of the people attending seemed particularly happy, according to organiser Bianca Wylie. She told the BBC that those gathered had a range of concerns, from the lack of transparency in the way Toronto Waterfront had awarded the contract to Sidewalk Labs, to doubts about whether the firm has a proven track record in delivering such an ambitious project. There were also concern about what the company was planning to do with the area in the long term. ""This group was formed because leaked documents in the Toronto Star suggested Sidewalk Labs had a far grander vision than the 12-acre (48,500-sq m) site it had talked about. We were concerned that we were not getting transparency,"" Ms Wylie told the BBC. The article she refers to alleged that the Google-affiliate wanted to build a much bigger neighbourhood at Quayside and provide new transport for it. In return for its investment it wanted a share of property taxes, development fees and increased value of city land that would normally go to the city. This has not been disputed by Sidewalk Labs. Living in a lab The idea of the increasingly blurred lines between private firm and public government has a lot of people ""very worried"", said Dr Anthony Townsend, urban planner and author of a series of books on smart cities. ""Has the land-grab of the digital realm now extended into the financial realm? Is Sidewalks Lab going to monetise transportation and mobility from the government? Is that its real business model?"" he asked. For Ms Wylie, there are also a lot of questions to answer about plans for the smaller, 12-acre site. ""We have not been talking about the fact that it is normalising massive data collection or even asking whether anyone wants this thing at all. No-one here has asked for a sensor-laden neighbourhood,"" she said. ""Our waterfront must be developed for the benefit of the citizens of Toronto, not the shareholders of a Google-affiliate."" Sidewalk Labs told the BBC that it had not yet submitted its proposals to Waterfront Toronto, and said that it looked forward to ""continuing to work with Torontonians to get this right"", adding that it was ""strongly committed to protection and privacy"" of urban data. Smart city 'hype' The project also faces legal opposition from the Canadian Civil Liberties Association (CCLA), which is suing three levels of government over its plans to build the smart neighbourhood. Its director Brenda McPhail told the BBC that it was ""inappropriate"" for a firm like Google to design privacy policies to govern city neighbourhoods. ""Comprehensive data collection online is harming individuals and groups,"" she said. ""It is affecting everything from the way individuals are targeted with products to how they are targeted to influence their votes. So we question why on earth we think it is a good idea to import that big data model into our cities' streets. ""The smart city model is all about hype. They believe that if we have enough data we can solve all our problems, and we need to be sceptical about those claims."" Sidewalk Labs clearly does not agree. ""This debate must be rooted in fact, not fiction and fearmongering. It's unfortunate that once again CCLA has chosen to mischaracterise our work and our engagement with the people of Toronto,"" it told the BBC in a statement. But CCLA are not lone voices. Last year, the firm's own privacy adviser Dr Ann Cavoukian resigned. ""I imagined us creating a smart city of privacy, as opposed to a smart city of surveillance"", she said bluntly in her resignation letter. The firm's final plans for the redevelopment are now behind schedule as it deals with the controversies. Toronto Waterfront chairman Stephen Diamond recently told Canadian publication The Logic that he expects them to be a ""few months late"". A spokesman for Toronto Waterfront added: ""The evaluation process will determine which parts of the proposal, if any, may be pursued further."" As cities around the world embrace technology and engage with tech firms to improve urban efficiency, will the problems Toronto has encountered give them pause for thought? Prof Saskia Sassen, a smart cities expert who teaches sociology at Columbia University, thinks it might. ""In principle, having a private corporation doing public work is fine and a lot of the time it works out. But when you are dealing with them installing a complex system, then chances are they will also do the next steps - thereby further privatising the work,"" she told the BBC. ""Google is already master of the online domain, so having a company affiliated to them as masters of the offline one as well could be problematic.""",It was meant to be a vision of how we will all live in future - a smart city built from the internet up - offering citizens the chance to experience the very latest technology.
"It hopes a version for mobile devices could subsequently be released within three to five years. The news was reported by a paper run by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT). It follows a decision in May to ban the use of Windows 8 on many Chinese government computers. The restriction was nominally imposed because of a decree about energy-saving devices. However, several local reports suggested the real reason was a fear that Windows 8 PCs might be vulnerable to US surveillance. An MIIT-backed think tank had also voiced concern about the popularity of Google's Android. In the new report, Ni Guangnan - who heads up an alliance of developers for the academy - noted that ""more than a dozen"" Chinese companies had opted to customise Google's operating system (OS) rather than create an alternative from the ground up. These include the country's best-selling handset maker Xiaomi, whose new Miui 6 OS is based on version 4.4.4 of Android. ""Creating an environment that allows us to contend with Google, Apple and Microsoft, is the key to success,"" he said, adding that the new OS would support app stores. Chinese systems This is not China's first attempt to build an operating system of its own. In June 2000, a company called Red Flag was founded at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. It went on to release a Linux-based OS for desktop and server computers as well as several compatible productivity applications. The software was used in government departments and schools, but the business collapsed earlier this year after running out of funds. The country's National University of Defense Technology also developed the Kylin OS about a decade ago. The system - named after a mythical beast dubbed the ""Chinese unicorn"" - was designed to be a high-security option for users in government, defence, energy, aerospace and other critical industries. While the software was recently used on Tianhe-2 - the world's fastest supercomputer - development of a version for consumer PCs has focused on Ubuntu Kylin since 2013. This is a variant of Canonical's Linux-based OS, which has been tailored for people that use the simplified Chinese writing system and the Chinese lunar calendar. It was first released in April last year, and its website says an update is due for release in October. It is not clear whether this is linked to the project outlined by Ni Guangnan. In addition, the Chinese Academy of Sciences unveiled COS (China Operating System) in January - a Linux-based OS for mobile devices that was said to be fully home-grown. At the time, several bloggers noted it resembled HTC's Sense user interface for Android, leading to speculation that the Taiwanese firm had been involved. But the academy has denied the accusation.",The Chinese Academy of Engineering has disclosed plans to release a new operating system for PCs as soon as October.
"By Chris BaraniukTechnology reporter The Vive Pro has two OLED screens that have a total resolution of 2880 by 1600 pixels, which is 78% more than the current model. This is designed to make graphics and text much sharper for the wearer. One analyst said it was a step in the right direction, but VR still needed more quality content to lure gamers. As well as displays that should be more crisp than before, the Vive Pro also includes high performance headphones with a built-in amplifier to offer ""a heightened sense of presence"" and richer sound, according to the Taiwanese firm. However, the company has not yet revealed how much the new headset will cost. The reveal coincided with news that Facebook's Oculus VR division has teamed up with China's Xiaomi. The Beijing-based handset maker will be involved in the creation of Oculus Go - a forthcoming standalone headset that will not need to be plugged into a computer, which is due for release soon. The two firms also announced they would release a version of the kit to be branded Mi VR Standalone. It will exclusively go on sale in China, where most of Facebook's services are blocked. The two firms added that both headsets would be powered by a Qualcomm processor, the Snapdragon 821. No strings attached Owners of both the new and original HTC headsets will be able to use them with a wireless adapter when it becomes available later this year. HTC says it will connect either of the models to computers running a game or simulation via wi-fi, thanks to Intel's WiGig technology. And the firm has also come up with a new way for virtual reality users to discover new content - 3D previews that they can try out before purchasing or subscribing. These will be available via a revamped version of the Viveport VR store. Viveport's president, Rikard Steiber told his CES audience that he expected the number of experiences available on the platform to rise from 2,000 to 3,000 by the end of 2018. More from CES 2018: ""It's great to see HTC come forward and improve device specs,"" said Brian Blau, an analyst at Gartner. ""It's something that's really needed to help users get over the hump of things like motion sickness [sometimes caused by blurring in VR headset displays]."" Mr Blau told the BBC that much of the hype around virtual reality devices had meant that the technology sometimes failed to live up to people's expectations - something he believes has impacted slightly sluggish sales of VR hardware. The next generation of headsets might include even more advanced technologies like eye-tracking, which could allow ultra high resolution rendering of graphics at the exact point on the screen where users are looking. ""The one thing that will change the situation though is quality content,"" added Mr Blau. ""You could argue and say there are a lot of games out there, even businesses are adopting VR... but it's not nearly enough. ""Technology ecosystems require a massive amount of content to keep people coming back, and it has to be diverse.""

"By Zoe KleinmanTechnology reporter, BBC News It happened to my friend Beth. One day she mentioned that she had met a man online who was in the military. She thought it was a neat coincidence, because my partner is also in the armed forces. But the more she told me, the louder the alarm bells rang. Despite being deployed on a ""top secret mission"" in a highly dangerous part of the world, ""Alexander"" managed to message Beth all the time. He was handsome, charming and affectionate. When she showed me a photo, my heart sank. Alexander's uniform and rank didn't match the role he said he had or the unit he said he was in. There was no reason for him to be in the place where he claimed to be. He was almost certainly not the man in the photo. 'He could be anyone, anywhere' Telling Beth was hard. ""It made me shake,"" she said. ""You start thinking this could be someone that you could have the chance to meet and see if there's any potential to see how it goes... then straight after that is the shock that you've been talking to someone who is not the person he said he was, and who could be anyone, anywhere in the world."" If it hadn't been for the coincidence of our joint military connection, Beth probably wouldn't have mentioned him to me or anyone else - he had already spun a web of secrecy around his job. In fact, telling someone else is probably your best chance of not getting sucked in. Alexander contacted Beth on a dating platform, but he very quickly asked her to switch to a messaging app. Cyber-security expert Prof Alan Woodward says scammers much prefer to operate within a private environment, away from the chance of being seen by others - whether that's a direct messaging platform or a locked social media account. ""Effectively you're giving them a bit of camouflage,"" he says. ""There isn't going to be somebody who can see publicly that the same person who might have been trying to scam them is now trying to scam you."" I noticed myself that, after making my own Instagram account private, I was deluged with follow requests and private messages, all apparently from men, many of them claiming to have military positions. The military represents ""authority, trust, romance"" for many people, says New York Times reporter Jack Nicas, who made a documentary about romance scammers and their victims. ""For many, particularly women in middle America, the military guy is the 'ideal man',"" he says. Faking it I wondered how the real people in the photos the scammers were using would feel if they knew, and I then got a small taste of it myself when someone set up a fake Instagram account using my pictures, and started messaging people - mainly men I believe - saying it was my ""secret"" space. I only found out when people started messaging me to ask what was going on. It was sickening, alarming and infuriating. I'll probably never know exactly what the ""fake me"" said and to whom. It was all in the form of private messages from an account bearing my name and my face. Instagram deleted it when I complained, but declined to tell me whereabouts in the world it had been registered. Perhaps it was even Alexander, finding me via Beth's followers. The platform said impersonating a person or organisation is against its guidelines, and that such accounts are deleted once it is made aware of them. A quick search reveals that there are plenty out there though. For scammers it's worth the risk, as the pay-out can be huge. Horror stories There are people who work to try to help romance scam victims, and they hear plenty of horror stories. One is Lisa Forte, from Red Goat Cyber-Security, who was contacted by a British lawyer in her 40s who had given $350,000 to a scammer in South America - which she got by re-mortgaging her house. Wayne May, who runs the group Scam Survivors, told us of a man in Russia who gave $250,000 to a man he believed he was having a secret relationship with. And Jack Nicas interviewed Renee Holland from Florida, who transferred her life savings to a man pretending to be in the US military. She was later killed by her husband. The money, particularly if sent by wire transfer, is generally gone forever. Mr Nicas tracked Ms Holland's scammer down to Nigeria - where romance scammers are rife. There young men work sometimes in groups, sometimes individually, and pretend to be both men and women online. He interviewed a man called Akinola Bolaji, a 35-year-old Nigerian who said he had once been a ""Yahoo Boy"", as romance scammers are colloquially known. Mr Bolaji said finding victims was a numbers game. ""You may message thousands [of women],"" he told the New York Times. ""Only a few will respond. Five will comply. Out of the five, three may not have money. Two will have. Out of two, one may not be able to spend money. But one will surely send."" He confessed to feeling guilty about the practice. ""But poverty will not make you feel the pain because you need the money,"" he said. Mr Bolaji claims to have stopped romance scamming because he is now in a genuine relationship with a lady in the US state of Georgia. We only have his word for it. The long game In the few weeks that Alexander was messaging my friend Beth, he did not ask for any cash. That is not surprising, says Mr Nicas. ""You don't even start asking for money until maybe a few weeks or a few months in,"" he said. ""You have to earn their trust first, because if you on the first day say, 'I need money', they're going to know that you're a scammer."" Beth is adamant that she would not have sent any - but scammers are super-persuasive, says Ms Forte. ""They build a rapport and they slowly take you on this journey from being cautious all the way to re-mortgaging your house. I think we're all vulnerable to it in the right situation."" Where to go for help","You may well think you'd never fall for a romance scam, that they're cheesy, inauthentic and very obviously after your cash. But security experts have warned that there's been an increase in all sorts of online fraud during the coronavirus pandemic."
"Dave LeeNorth America technology reporter But for those that use its site legally, the decision to ban adult content across its entire network is seen as a reluctance to tackle the issues properly. Tumblr has decided to give up, rather than do as other sites have done and invest in measures to handle illegal content, while allowing sexual expression. “There are no shortage of sites on the internet that feature adult content,” said Jeff D’Onofrio, the site’s chief executive, in explaining the decision. He’s right, of course. There’s a lot of porn out there. But Tumblr has long offered something different, and important. Founded 11 years ago, Tumblr is a platform where users can publish text, images and videos quickly, as well as share and comment on other submissions. The site’s popularity peaked in 2014. Yet as its use dwindled, its reputation as an alternative corner of the internet grew, not least as a place to find unique adult material. Unlike typical pornography sites, which overwhelmingly cater to men, and serve an often narrow definition of what is attractive, Tumblr has been a home for something else - content tailored at vibrant LGBT communities, or for those with tastes you might not necessarily share with all your friends. If society deems it acceptable for any porn to be on the internet, then that acceptance must surely be inclusive. Unlike most of those other sites Mr D’Onofrio speaks of, Tumblr has been a space where different body types are sexually celebrated, not degraded. 'I had feared this day would come' In 2015, Cosmopolitan described Tumblr as a place where women ""can explore their sexuality with the support of women without judgement or fear”. It argued that Tumblr's design seemed to cater to different physical need: offering a slow, building stream of visual and emotional content - rather than the instant video gratification of sites designed with hurried male audiences in mind, fast-forward button and all. Many on Tumblr have been fearing a porn ban since the network was acquired by fading web giant Yahoo in 2013. That time, the adult content was allowed to remain. But in 2017, when Yahoo was acquired by Oath, the digital arm of telecoms giant Verizon, the writing was on the wall. ""I had feared this day would come,” wrote one user, who runs a fetish account, in response to the chief executive’s message on Monday. ""I’m so sad to see this happen, and can’t believe I’ll be losing this blog. I honestly don’t know what I’ll do without it, but I truly hope that the kinky community comes up with a new place for us all to get together and share.” When the new guidelines come into effect they will prohibit any depiction of human genitalia, “female-presenting nipples” or sex acts - including illustrations. There will be exceptions for classical artistic works and political protests that involve nudity, but the company warned enforcement might be inconsistent. Users are able to export their posts if they wish to leave the platform. ""We’ve given serious thought to who we want to be to our community moving forward,” Mr D’Onofrio said. “We’ve realised that in order to continue to fulfil our promise and place in culture, especially as it evolves, we must change.” That change means marginalised people, those who are all-too-used to being ostracised in their offline lives, now face it in their online space too. Some of the internet’s most-needed communities are now homeless. ________ Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC Do you have more information about this or any other technology story?

"By Chris BaraniukTechnology reporter US forecasters have expressed concerns about 5G radio interference before, but now a group of scientific bodies has written to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) over the issue. The joint letter, spotted by news site The Register, says the situation is ""deeply concerning"". It asks for an auction of radio spectrum for 5G uses to be delayed. Interference caused by increased communications activity could delay the reporting of important weather information to the public - for example during hurricanes - according to the American Geophysical Union, American Meteorological Society and the National Weather Association. They argued that the weather networks they rely on are ""crucially important for public safety and scientific research"". ""The loss of seconds can mean the difference between safety and grave risk to life and property,"" wrote AccuWeather executive Jonathan Porter in a separate letter to the FCC. Satellites beam images of the Earth to meteorologists and they also send data gathered from thousands of ground-based sensors. The organisation that wants to use the band of spectrum in question - 1,675 to 1,680 MHz - for 5G purposes is called Ligado Networks. In its own letter to the FCC, Ligado said failure to allow 5G use within the band would ""lead to the inefficient allocation of this prime, lower mid-band spectrum - something the US can ill afford as it attempts to win the race to 5G"". The firm argues that weather forecasters could instead download weather data via internet services. However, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has monitored how quickly such technologies can deliver photographs of the entire Earth, known as ""full disk imagery"" - and found them to be too slow. ""Earlier in June 2019, the latency of full disk and other images were regularly as high as three to seven minutes, far too significant for timely weather bulletins,"" the three meteorological organisations wrote in their joint FCC letter. How much interference may be caused depends largely on where new 5G networks spring up, said Prof William Webb, independent consultant and author of the book The 5G Myth. ""If it's only deployed in city centres it probably won't cause interference, but if it's used in large volumes near the meteorological sites then yes it could,"" he told the BBC. The GSMA - an organisation that represents mobile network operators - has said that it believes that 5G services and weather sensing services can co-exist. ""We cannot allow these scare tactics to prevent us from reaping the huge societal and economic benefits of 5G networks,"" said Brett Tarnutzer, the trade body's head of spectrum. ""We urge everyone to simply look at the facts and not get drawn in by misleading rhetoric.""","Signals from weather satellites could be disrupted by 5G mobile data networks in the US, meteorologists have warned."
"By Leo KelionTechnology reporter Caterpillar is to sell a package of sensors, alarms and software which detect when a truck driver is about to fall asleep. BHP Billiton and gold producer Newmont Mining have already carried out trials. The firms believe it out-performs earlier systems that needed workers to wear special equipment. Driver Safety Solution (DSS) also benefits from the fact it does not need to be recalibrated when one worker swaps shift with another. The product was developed by Australian firm, Seeing Machines, which secured the tie-up with Caterpillar after a panel of experts selected it over 21 rival technologies. It will cost up to $20,000 (£13,260) to install on each vehicle, although a discount applies if it is bought in bulk. According to the Parker Bay Company, a mining research firm, there were approximately 38,500 active mining trucks in service at the end of last year. Buzzing seats DSS uses a camera to detect a driver's pupil size, how frequently they blink, and how long they keep their eyes shut. In addition it tracks where the user's mouth is in order to work out when the workers are not looking at the road. To help identify these features truck cabs are also fitted with an infrared lamp. Its light is invisible to humans, but allows the camera to see in the dark and through employees' safety glasses. An accelerometer and GPS chip are also installed to confirm the truck is being driven at the time, and the data is processed by a computer mounted behind the driver's seat which is designed to cope with strong vibrations and dust. The aim is to detect the onset of micro-sleep - periods when a person passes out for anywhere from a fraction of a second to up to half a minute, and then wakes up again without realising they lost consciousness. If the computer's software believes this has occurred it triggers an audio alarm and vibrates a motor built into the driver's seat to rouse them. An alert is also sent back to the miner's support staff who can view a streamed video feed of the driver's eyes and view data about their recent behaviour. ""Dependent on the organisation's fatigue mitigation policy, they will then decide what to do with the driver,"" explained Ken Kroeger, chief executive of Seeing Machines. ""For most mining companies the first incident doesn't result in any communication. The second one will result in a radio call to see if the driver is OK and possibly get them to pull into the fuel depot and get a cup of coffee to help them keep going. ""And the third incident will result in them being assigned some other tasks instead of driving."" Mr Kroeger suggested that in time a similar camera-based warning system might become as ""common as airbags"" across the auto industry. For now he acknowledged that the system was not perfect: for example, if a user glances down, the camera loses sight of the driver's eyes and sounds the alarm. Even so, a spokesman for Newmont Mining told the BBC it believed DSS had reduced fatigue-related incidents by 90% during a pilot study at one of its sites in Nevada. Fatigue kills Research suggests that fatigue is a major problem for the trucking industry. A 2011 Brazilian study indicated sleepiness caused 4.5% of truck crashes on the country's roads, and almost 50% of incidents were caused by ""inattention"". Another study the same year based on coroners' inquest examinations suggested driver fatigue caused about 10% of reported truck crashes in Australia. Experts say these figures may still underestimate the problem. ""Fatigue is difficult to identify post-crash because there are no physical markers, like the sort that can be identified using blood tests, as for drugs and alcohol,"" Dr Daniel Blower, from the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute, told the BBC. ""The best estimate that I have seen is that the true incidence of fatigue in truck crashes is likely to be two to three times higher than in the captured crash data."" Although miners have been able to limit some of the more common causes of collision - such as speeding and mechanical defects - tiredness remains a problem. According to Caterpillar's own data, operator fatigue was a factor in 65% of truck haulage accidents in 2007. Tiredness trackers Seeing Machine's product is not the only one targeting the issue. The cheapest solution is head-nod sensors - either built into workers' helmets or hooked around their ears - but the nature of the drivers' job means false alarms can be a problem. Australia's AcuMine offers a product called HaulCheck which uses laser scanners and guide posts along truck routes to sound an alarm if trucks head off-path. Another Australian firm, Optalert, monitors eyelid movements to warn of problems at an earlier point, but unlike Seeing Machines it involves workers having to wear a special pair of glasses. And British firm Fatigue Management International offers a system called Astid which monitors steering movements to detect exaggerated corrections and other indicators of sleepiness.",Eye and face-tracking technology that aims to prevent accidents caused by fatigue is being rolled out by the world's biggest mining equipment maker.
"Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent@BBCRoryCJon Twitter Because Bute is the site of a pilot of a technology called White Space, which seems as though it might be ideally suited to filling in some of the gaps in our broadband coverage. BT, which is running the trial, is certainly hoping that it will be part of the answer to reaching the 10% of the population which won't be served by the market, or by the various government schemes to bring fast fibre to remote areas. White Space is part of the dividend from the digital switchover, spare spectrum no longer needed for television broadcasts. It is in the UHF band, familiar to anyone who tuned an old television years ago, and the amount of ""space"" varies around the UK. Fortunately, there is more of it in the areas where broadband coverage is already patchy and households are unlikely to see a fibre connection arriving anytime soon. Places like the Isle of Bute and other more remote spots in the Highlands and Islands. The pilot programme on Bute involves a transmitter at a tiny exchange near the community of Kilchattan Bay, from which a broadband signal is transmitted to 10 homes participating in the trial. It sounds like wi-fi but the signal is actually just an extension of the fixed line network, with homes needing their own aerials to pick it up. The McAlister family farm is one place testing out White Space. It's too far from the exchange for the copper network to deliver broadband, and the satellite broadband link the family used to depend on proved both expensive and unreliable. So how is the new broadband link? ""You'll have to ask my wife and kids about that,"" Robert McAlister told me when I asked what benefit the family were getting from the trial. But, as we looked at some of his prize bulls which can fetch a good price at auction, he explained that he had found one profitable use for the web. His daughter had shown him how he could monitor cattle auctions on the mainland via their websites, and watch live to see where the best prices could be found. Chris Gibbs of BT's Openreach division, which hopes eventually to offer White Space as a wholesale broadband product, explained that it was a technology which would augment, rather than replace the standard copper network: ""Although it has the same characteristics as copper - the further you go the worse the signal gets - it goes a bit further, and that's the advantage."" And, like a television signal, it can go direct to homes, whereas a copper or fibre cable has to wind its way along country lanes. On a glorious March day - apparently it never rains on Bute - we toured the island to test the speeds delivered over the trial network. On a viewing platform overlooking a bay where seals could be seen playing in the shallows, we tested it out with a Skype video call. After a few hitches, it seemed to work pretty well, with sound and video coming across then network. The speeds on offer, however, are far from spectacular. BT says it can deliver around 10Mbps or more, but at the moment it's giving users download speeds of between 4 and 8Mbps. My own tests showed the network delivering only around 3Mbps - but then the upload speeds were about the same, making video conferencing eminently feasible. During the trial, the available capacity is being tweaked between upload and download to see what works best for consumers. Compared with what they had before, the White Space broadband certainly seems an improvement to the trialists. At the Kingarth Hotel, a fine pub at Kilchattan Bay, they explained that their old broadband connection made it virtually impossible to order new stocks of beer online, with ""timed out"" messages a constant irritation. Now they have much speedier access to the brewery website. BT says this trial, and another taking place in Cambridge, are yielding promising results, but it warns that it is early days and it still isn't clear whether the technology will prove commercially viable. And White Space will have competition in the drive to bring faster broadband to Britain's notspots. As I caught the ferry back from Bute to the mainland I took a call from a company eager to tell me about a rival technology. A firm called Tooway Direct, which provides satellite broadband connectivity, promised that it could offer customers in Bute and elsewhere across the Highlands and Islands, a fast and affordable broadband connection. I pointed out that the farmer I had visited in Bute had found his satellite link neither fast nor cheap. Tooway Direct's managing director Andrew Walwyn admitted that the technology was still suffering from an image problem, but insisted that the launch last year of a new satellite dedicated to broadband provision had transformed the situation. For many communities, he told me, the chances of getting a fast broadband connection in the next five years from BT were remote, but satellite promised ""really fast broadband now with a comparatively small investments."" So, White Space could be one answer to patching the gaps in broadband coverage, satellite or 3G and 4G mobile networks could be another. The good news is that places that seemed doomed to the broadband slow lane are now in the sights of companies promising to make life online better.","He's a quiet, even shy, farmer working hard tending his beef cattle herd on the Isle of Bute and mending outbuildings battered in the January storms. He admits he knows little or nothing about the internet, but Robert McAlister is part of an experiment which could help the UK achieve the government's slightly unlikely goal of leading Europe in broadband provision."
"But who are these people and how will this proposed new law be different from the current regulations? Who are the internet trolls? The term has come to mean those behind intentionally provocative online actions intended to cause grief or incite an angry response. This can happen in online forums, message boards, chat rooms, and on social networks and microblogging sites, as well as personal emails. Trolls may exist in any online community that allows comments from users - for example, video-streaming sites, such as YouTube and online video-games sites. They can act individually or in groups - known as ""colluding"" trolls. One member of such a group often behaves as the obvious troll, while the others disguise themselves as normal members of the online community. These trolls in disguise then defend the comments of the overt one. Trolls may also target the recently bereaved, posting offensive material about the dead person. After 17-year-old Charlotte Porter died in 2010, her parents said that her memory had been ""destroyed"" by abusive online messages on her Facebook memorial site. One of the latest examples of an internet troll is Frank Zimmerman, who was given a 26-week suspended prison sentence after sending an offensive email to Corby MP Louise Mensch. He was also banned from contacting a host of celebrities, including Lord Sugar. What is the law at the moment? Currently, a website operator is liable for everything that appears on its site. So if somebody believes that something defamatory has been written about them online, he or she may have to take the website to court for redress, incurring huge costs. Justice Secretary Ken Clarke explained: ""As the law stands, individuals can be the subject of scurrilous rumour and allegation on the web with little meaningful remedy against the person responsible. ""Website operators are in principle liable as publishers for everything that appears on their sites, even though the content is often determined by users. ""But most operators are not in a position to know whether the material posted is defamatory or not and very often - faced with a complaint - they will immediately remove material."" How might the new law be different? The UK Ministry of Justice is proposing a defamation bill, which is being debated in the Commons, to make it easier for people to challenge what has been written about them. If people think that there is defamatory content being posted about them online, instead of taking action against the website where the information appears, they can ask the website operator to give them the name of the person who posted the remarks. This way, they can take legal action against trolls directly, requiring them to remove the defamatory posts. ""Our proposed approach will give greater protection to operators of websites who comply with a procedure to identify the authors of allegedly defamatory material,"" said Justice Secretary Ken Clarke. ""The government wants a libel regime for the internet that makes it possible for people to protect their reputations effectively but also ensures that information online can't be easily censored by casual threats of litigation against website operators. ""It will be very important to ensure that these measures do not inadvertently expose genuine whistleblowers, and we are committed to getting the detail right to minimise this risk."" The BBC understands that the term ""troll"" will not figure in the bill, and the new law will only refer to ""defamatory"" content. Which sites would be covered by the rule change? The proposals would apply to all websites, regardless of which country their servers or headquarters were based. However, the claimant would need to be able to show that the UK was the appropriate place to bring the action. What about privacy? Privacy International, an organisation that campaigns at an international level on privacy issues, says that ""there is a concern that gun-shy website operators will start automatically divulging user details the moment someone alleges defamation in order to shield themselves from libel actions"". ""A great deal of the content posted by internet trolls is not actually defamatory, instead constituting harassment, invasion of privacy or simply unpleasant but lawfully expressed opinion,"" Emma Draper, head of communications at Privacy International, told BBC News. ""However, if the choice is between protecting users' anonymity and avoiding a potentially costly lawsuit, many small operators are not going to be overly concerned about whether or not a user has genuinely defamed the complainant.""","Website operators in the UK may soon have to identify people who have posted defamatory messages online, allowing the victim to undertake legal action against the ""troll"" rather than against the website."
"In 2017 it shared the honour with Virgin Media, but in 2018 and 2019 the prize was all TalkTalk's. Its customers were most likely to be unhappy with the outcome of complaints. A spokeswoman for TalkTalk said the data showed an ""improving trend"" on the number of complaints. The Ofcom report notes that the handling of customer complaints could be improved ""across the industry"", with only half of those who make a complaint to any provider ending up happy with the result. The top two reasons for complaining were poor or unreliable connectivity, and issues with broadband speed. However, the total number of complaints to Ofcom about broadband services fell by 23%. The survey also found: One company stood out with a sharp rise in complaints. Plusnet's share more than doubled in the last quarter of 2018. The telecoms regulator notes that, at the time, the firm had experienced problems with a new billing system. 'Hard to hide' ""It's hard for TalkTalk to hide from the fact that their customer service isn't up to scratch,"" Ofcom's director of market intelligence Iain Macrae told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""We absolutely think that the firms need to up their games in the way they handle complaints."" He added that the regulator was encouraged by the fact that the total number of complaints to broadband providers had fallen. ""We're pleased that Ofcom's data again shows an improving trend for the number of complaints received about TalkTalk,"" a spokeswoman for the firm said. ""And while some of the results in the quality-of-service report are disappointing, we are already seeing more customers than ever staying with us."" The provider would continue to ""enhance"" the services it offered in response, she added.",TalkTalk has failed to improve its standing on customer complaints in Ofcom's annual survey - the broadband provider has come bottom of the table for the third year running.
"By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter These days, the mum chats are far outnumbered by the scams. Last week, fed up with their frequency, I asked the caller, who claimed to be from Microsoft's technical department, where she had got my number. ""Take me off the list,"" I asked. ""Give me £1,000 and I will,"" she replied. It felt like an audacious new low for an industry that already seems to be getting out of hand. And for some, such calls are a lot more than just a nuisance. One woman had a mobile call telling her that there was an ongoing court case against her over an unpaid tax bill. The judge and jury were on the line, the scammer told her, but if she immediately transferred payment of £999, the case would go better for her. She panicked and paid but was told it was not enough. So she went to the bank, with the scammer still on the line, and sent another £4,000. ""As soon as she had done it, she realised it was a scam,"" said Louise Baxter-Scott, head of the national Trading Standards scam team. According to Trading Standards, there has been a surge in such calls during lockdown. ""Everyone is at home so they are easy prey,"" said Ms Baxter-Scott. And the scams are getting more sophisticated and more threatening. One currently doing the rounds, purporting to be from the National Crime Agency, claims there is a warrant out for your arrest for ""serious offences"". Another common claim is that National Insurance numbers have been stolen, which might seem plausible given the number of data thefts. Although the request to immediately send money to the tax office should ring alarm bells. Increasingly the calls are coming through to people's mobile phones, often appearing as a UK number to add another layer of legitimacy. The top three problems Trading Standards identified were: Some of these are defined as nuisance calls because they are actually selling something - albeit it something you probably do not need. Others are out-and-out scams. People are thought to receive an average of seven scam or nuisance calls per month. Scammers are particularly targeting the elderly. Blocking calls Trading Standards provided 2,000 call-blocking devices to people's homes to test their effectiveness at preventing the calls and to provide intelligence about the perpetrators. The trial suggested such technology blocked more than 90% of unwanted calls. Stevie Corbin-Clarke, a research assistant at Bournemouth University, worked on the project to understand the effect scams have on the public. Her research concluded that receiving scam and nuisance calls had a significant effect on people's wellbeing. All regular landline users were likely to benefit from having a call blocker and they should also be made available to vulnerable individuals, the research suggested. Robocalls Similar blockers such as YouMail exist in the US, where automated calls, or robocalls, are getting out of hand. A Business Insider survey suggested that half of Americans reported receiving scam phone calls on their mobiles every day, with another quarter receiving them several times per week. During February, 4.6 billion were made, according to YouMail's chief executive Alex Quilici. ""The 2020 pandemic closed call centres so there were fewer, but now everything is opening up and robocalls are back,"" he told the BBC. So-called robodiallers, often located overseas, make millions of calls per hour. ""It costs almost nothing to make these phone calls and they don't need a lot of people to respond to make a profit,"" said Mr Quilici. He described how one New York-based woman in her 60s lost her life savings - some $350,000 - to a tax office scam. A student in her twenties lost $40,000 to a language school fraud scheme. YouMail is a free app, although the firm offers a premium paid-for service to small businesses, and so far 10 million have signed up. In the long run, Mr Quilici believes the problem will become rather like email spam - it will reach a certain level of intolerability, forcing both technological solutions and consumers to change behaviour. ""That combination will work but it will take a long time,"" he said. As part of the fightback, last year the US Department of Justice launched cases against five companies they alleged were gateway carriers - allowing hundreds of millions of robocalls into the US phone system. Meanwhile in the UK last month, the Information Commissioner's Office issued fines amounting to £270,000 to two separate companies for making unlawful marketing calls to numbers registered with the Telephone Preference Service (TPS). Just a month earlier it handed out £480,000 worth of fines to four other companies. Despite the fines, which are not always paid, similar firms keep popping back up. Ms Baxter-Scott thinks phone companies could do more ""to block calls on their networks"". And she is hoping that the trial with call blockers can be extended to local authorities. ""It is proven that having a £100 call blocker reduces anxiety, insomnia and [boosts] wellbeing so it make sense to fund this,"" she said.","When my landline rings (yes, I still have a landline), it is only ever going to be either my mum, my mother-in-law or a scam caller."
"By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter It also flushes its toilets with rainwater, has a robot security guard that will challenge you if you wander around at night and a whole range of clever technology to make the building sustainable. The developers behind it, Dutch firm OVG, liked it so much that they moved in when it was finished. So is the office that has already been dubbed the world's greenest, really as smart as it seems? The building, whose main tenant is consultancy firm Deloitte and was designed by London-based architects PLP Architecture, boasts ""smart"" ceilings embedded with 28,000 sensors, which measure temperature, light, motion and humidity. The lighting, designed by Phillips, is also smart - each one of the LED panels is ultra-efficient and requires only a tiny amount of electricity. Workers can control the temperature, lighting and blinds via a series of apps on their smartphones and work is ongoing to unify them. Read more about how technology is changing our workplaces: Users select the temperature they want from a sliding gauge on their phone and it will in turn adjust the valves in the pipes above their head. Each valve controls the temperature of around four desks so they do have to hope that the colleague sitting next to them is also happy with the change. Facilities manager Wybe Van der Mey tells me, with some degree of pride, that in the first year of opening he only received a handful of complaints about the heating. ""In a traditional building that would be our headache number one,"" he said. Workers can also use one of the apps to book meeting rooms, open lockers and check in to their desks. When The Edge first opened its doors in September 2014, around 20% of the workers checked themselves in via the app. That quickly fell to 10% and is now at around 1%, according to Mr Van der Mey. ""We hoped everyone would check in to their desks daily but they haven't done that."" Each floor of Deloitte's office is laid out exactly the same, making it the ultimate hot-desking environment. It should in theory mean the firm can allocate desks - if people used the app. ""The dream of a facilities manager is to tell people where to go based on available space. Technically it is possible, but behaviourally it is not. People want to go to the same place every day and sit with their peers."" Neither is the app-based system to book meeting rooms running entirely smoothly. Many don't use it, leading to double-booked rooms, while others book rooms that they never intend to use because it gains them an extra parking space. It is unclear how many use the stickers with QR codes which adorn all the meeting rooms, allowing users to connect to everything inside the room via their smartphone - including powering up the 4K screens to show their own presentations, controlling the lighting and heating and even lowering the blinds to stop their audience from daydreaming out of the window. There is no doubting The Edge's green credentials however. In December 2014 it received the highest ever BREEAM (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Methodology) which has become the de facto test for sustainability in buildings. It got an outstanding rating with the highest-ever score of 98.36%, making it a star pupil in a business world that is increasingly being pushed to go green. It means that Mr Van der Mey has become used to a new job role - as tour guide. He has hosted architects, developers and news outlets and rejected a request from the Amsterdam tourist board to show a group of Chinese tourists around the building. They come to see a range of features, including an innovative approach to solar power. When it became clear to developer OVG that covering the roof with solar panels was not going to be enough to provide 100% of The Edge's electricity it turned to its neighbours - the VU University of Amsterdam and the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences - to install a further 4,100 sq m (44,100 sq ft) of solar panels on their rooftops in return for the free use of any spare electricity. The slanted atrium also has a job to do - draining off rainwater to be collected in troughs and reused for cleaning and flushing the toilets. The building is doing its bit to encourage its workers to go greener. There is a huge space for bikes and a whole wall dedicated to electric car charging points in the underground car park. The building is heated and cooled via an aquifer thermal energy storage system. Hot water is stored in wells in the ground during summer to help heat the building in winter and cold water in the same way in the winter to cool the building in the warmer months. There are no radiators in the building - all the heating is provided by cables that run through the ceilings. One carries data and the other water to provide an ambient temperature across the whole structure. Both Deloitte, the building's main tenant, and OVG, the developer, are open about the fact that The Edge is an experimental project and that not everything has worked. One of its biggest challenges is making sense of the mountains of data generated by the sensors. Maintaining the smartness of The Edge has, Mr Van der Mey jokes, turned his hair grey. ""It is challenging to cope with all the data and we are still learning how to read it,"" he told the BBC. For the moment the answer lies in data dashboards, which both the facilities teams and workers can access. It displays a variety of real-time data points - including the number of workers in the building at any given time, how many visitors, energy consumption and temperature. It also has some more fun data sets, such as a pie-chart showing how much coffee, and what type, is being consumed in the building at any given time. It became apparent from the data that lattes and cappuccinos were by far the most popular choice, meaning milk was frequently running out so Deloitte asked the manufacturer to make a new bespoke model with a larger compartment for milk - a real world example of how access to data can improve working lives. Every coffee machine is also connected to the internet, meaning facilities staff can see which ones are getting low and refill them before someone finds it empty. The towel rails in the bathrooms are similarly connected. The hours that cleaners work have also been changed as a result of the data and Mr Van der Mey is keen for this to happen more often. ""We want to predict how things will happen in the building - that will be the really smart thing,"" he said. Read more about how our built environment is being influenced by technology here.","The Edge office building in Amsterdam prides itself on good coffee, lots of natural light - no desk is far from a window - and a gym that allows you not just to get fit but also to contribute to the energy supply of the office."
"Fans of the controversial series have pledged more than $400,000 (£255,000) to Stainless Games. The firm had to meet the cash target on crowd-funding site Kickstarter in order to trigger payments from the project's backers. Several video games have succeeded on the site, sparking talk of a new funding model for low-budget titles. Close to 11,500 people have committed money to the reboot, pledging between $1 to $10,000. Backers include Markus ""Notch"" Persson - the former lead developer of the hit game Minecraft - who has promised $5,000. Stainless had to set up a separate company in the US in order to qualify to use Kickstarter. Stretch target Supporters do not receive a share of any profits, but are offered a range of scaled incentives to commit more money - including a free copy of the game when it is released and the chance to have their likeness used as one of the in-game pedestrians who drivers kill to score points. Stainless is trying to ""stretch"" the amount of support to $600,000 by promising Macintosh and Linux versions of the game in addition to the planned PC edition if it surpasses the new target. Carmageddon: Reincarnation follows Double Fine Adventure, which raised $3.3m; Wasteland 2, which raised $2.9m; Shadowrun Returns, which raised $1.8m; and dozens of other titles which have secured funding from similar schemes. ""I think that Kickstarter or similar programmes of its ilk will form a longstanding alternative to the traditional model of funding coming via large investors or publishers,"" Neil Barnden, co-founder of Stainless, told the BBC. ""It is the perfect place for indie developers to go to connect directly with the community who want to play their games, and help the gamers feel more involved in the process."" Unproven model Big budget titles, which can cost more than $40m to develop, are likely to remain the reserve of deep-pocketed publishers for the foreseeable future, particularly since some believe costs will rise further when the next generation of consoles are released. One industry analyst also suggested the crowd-funded model might prove to be a short-term phenomenon. ""Kickstarter is an interesting way for independent and sometimes niche games content to secure funding, but I don't believe it heralds a shift in financing for the larger games industry,"" said Piers Harding-Rolls, head of games at IHS Screen Digest. ""One issue the platform has is that it has become inundated with games funding requests, which I think will hamper the potential of future projects securing necessary funding. ""Also we have yet to see any major results from the games funded through Kickstarter. The future success of this channel of funding really depends on the results that come out of it."" Carmageddon's Kickstarter campaign is due to close on 6 June.",An Isle of Wight-based video games developer has secured enough cash to finance a new edition of Carmageddon.
"By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor Windows 10 is destined to change the way millions of us interact with our computers and gives Microsoft's chief executive, Satya Nadella, the opportunity to steer the company in a new direction. He describes the OS as ""Windows as a Service"", which means he plans to release improvements as they become available, via the internet, rather than working towards another ""big bang"" upgrade in a few years. Versions of the software will also be released for smartphones - making the Windows Phone OS defunct - as well as the Xbox One games console, ""internet of things"" kit and, potentially, smartwatches at a later stage. There has even been talk of this being the ""last version of Windows"" assuming all goes well - so no pressure then. Wait... what about Windows 9? The best explanation Microsoft has given for jumping a number has been in the form of a very nerdy joke: ""Windows 10 because seven, eight, [ate] nine."" The suspicion is the company's marketers just think it sounds cooler. And, of course, there is the added benefit that it further distances the product from the ill-fated Windows 8 while catching up in numeric terms with Apple's rival Mac OS X. So, what's new? At first look, at least on a desktop PC, the user interface looks pretty similar to the popular Windows 7. Microsoft is pitching the product as being ""familiar and easy to use"", as part of a shift away from the unpopular touch-centric focus of Windows 8. Perhaps the headline feature is the return of the Start Menu, providing users with quick pop-up access to their favourite apps, documents and settings. It does, however, carry over some of W8's design language. To the right of the list of sober-looking shortcuts, the Start Menu now also offers a selection of customisable ""live tiles"". These can also launch favoured apps, but people may prefer to use them to get at-a-glance updates about how many unread emails they have, what the weather is doing, forthcoming diary alerts and other notifications. Those pining for Windows 8's full-display Start Screen can still turn it back on via settings, and it appears by default on tablets when no keyboard is attached. The other big addition is Cortana - the virtual assistant first featured in Windows Phone 8.1. This makes sense of natural-language requests spoken or typed into a computer to help users manage their diaries, search the internet for information tailored to their interests, play music they might like, and control third-party apps, among other activities. The more Cortana studies its owner's habits, the better, in theory, the suggestions it makes. Those who find this a bit freaky can restrict the data it has access to. Other new features include: Can everyone download it on launch day? No. Microsoft is making it available to members of its Insider programme - people who tested preview versions of the system - from the start. But it is staggering delivery to others. As part of the process it is carrying out compatibility checks, so that PCs most likely to experience serious problems running the software do not get the upgrade until the relevant bugs have been dealt with. If users have not already pre-registered for the download, they can do so by clicking a Windows icon in their taskbar. If it isn't there, they will need to carry out a complicated workaround to make it appear. That means some people will have to wait days and perhaps weeks to get Windows 10 for free. Some computer makers have already, however, rushed out machines pre-installed with the software to shop shelves. Boxes containing the software on USB flash drives are also due to go on sale ""between mid-August and September"" for those that don't have broadband internet. Retailers - including Currys in the UK - are also offering in-store installs for a fee. Microsoft has a lot riding on this, doesn't it? The money paid by computer makers to preinstall Windows on their PCs is one of Microsoft's biggest sources of revenue. It also helps Microsoft direct business' budgets towards its lucrative add-on cloud services - including its Office 365 productivity suite, Azure cloud computing platform, and Dynamics supply chain management tools - as well as the IT support and training it sells. There are also subscription fees to be made from consumers, whether it is charging for OneDrive cloud storage, calls made via Skype, or access to Microsoft's Groove music library. Every customer lost to devices running a Google, Apple or Linux operating system is one more likely to spend their money elsewhere. In addition, every company that decides to stick with Windows 7, Vista or even XP is one that will not be able to support all of Microsoft's latest technologies. Windows Phone has also been a bit of a flop, at least in most countries. Now, there is a new pitch: if you link a Windows 10 Mobile handset to a screen, keyboard and mouse, it can double as a PC. This feature - called Continuum - might appeal to the billions of consumers in emerging economies for whom buying both a smartphone and a laptop would be unaffordable. What's Microsoft doing to give Windows 10 a better chance? Consumers and small businesses are being offered a free upgrade of existing computers running Windows 7 or 8 at any point over the first year of Windows 10's release. In addition, Microsoft's move to a ""universal app platform"" should make the OS more attractive to developers. Microsoft will run a single app store, and every product should be compatible with a plethora of devices - including PCs, Xboxes, smartphones and the forthcoming HoloLens headset - as long as the computer involved is powerful enough and the coder has made the user interface responsive. Microsoft is also making it easier for developers to port Android and iOS apps to the platform. But I've heard it's a bit flaky Until about a month ago, this was a common complaint about the preview builds. But critics acknowledge many of their biggest gripes have now been addressed , even if there are some outstanding issues - such as Edge's lack of support for extensions. Big businesses are still unlikely to adopt the OS on day one. Tech consultancy Gartner has advised its clients to wait until at least the second half of 2016. However, one issue that may have deterred consumers has been addressed. Microsoft caused controversy when it suggested people using the Home version of its system would have to add new features as they became available. Matters were not helped when it explicitly said businesses would be able to wait until ""quality and application compatibility has been assessed in the consumer market"". That led some bloggers to accuse Microsoft of treating the public like ""guinea pigs"". But on the eve of Windows 10's release, Microsoft told the BBC it had added an option to defer all Home Edition updates, security fixes aside. There remains, however, an incentive to buy the Pro or Enterprise versions, as their owners will be able to control which specific features are added. One final thought: just in case you try Windows 10 and do not like it, it is worth knowing there is a ""rollback"" option that works for the first 30 days.",The world's most used operating system has made it into double figures.
"Codenamed ""Piston"", the prototype, developed by Xi3 Corporation and funded by Valve, was unveiled at the CES trade show in Las Vegas. The set-top box will allow users to access thousands of gaming titles through an integrated system, a statement said. Plans for the living room-friendly console emerged early last month. ""Today marks the beginning of a new era for Xi3,"" said Jason Sullivan, founder and chief executive of Xi3, in a statement. ""This new development stage product will allow users to take full-advantage of their large high-definition TV displays for an amazing computer game experience,"" he added. ""As a result, this new system could provide access to thousands of gaming titles through an integrated system that exceeds the capabilities of leading game consoles, but can fit in the palm of your hand."" Despite the grapefruit-sized device being on show on both Valve and Xi3's stands at CES no details of its internals have been given. Other Xi3 computers are based around dual core Intel chips and use solid state storage. Valve, best known for the Half-Life, Left4Dead and the Steam online game store has long been known to be working on a console or set-top box that puts PC-based titles onto a TV. It is not yet clear if Piston is the hardware gaming gadget that will bring that project to fruition.",A modular PC designed to let users to play Steam games on their TV has been unveiled at CES.
"Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent@BBCRoryCJon Twitter In May, West Ham became the first Premier League club to sign an e-sports player, followed in July by Manchester City who signed up Kieran ""Kez"" Brown. Both clubs believe that e-sports are about to take off in a big way and this kind of move will show their fans and the gaming community that they are serious about getting involved. I met Sean Allen at West Ham's training ground where he watched the first team train, sat in on a press conference given by manager Slaven Bilic, then played a game of Fifa with a star player Cheikhou Kouyate. He won 5-0 by the way… 24-year-old Sean's career path on the way to becoming an e-sports star has not been smooth. He started playing in tournaments when he was 16 and won £500 in the first event he entered. But two years ago, he was on the verge of giving it up: ""I decided I was too old at 22, I sold my Xbox,"" he tells me. But he kept on plugging away and then this year got a big break, qualifying for the Fifa Interactive World Cup, an event he'd been trying to get into for years. He went to New York for the tournament and ended up in the final, losing narrowly to the Danish champion and coming away with $5000. That's when West Ham came calling, Having signed for the club, Sean can now devote himself to playing the game full time. I'd assumed he spent all his waking hours in front of his console at his home in Taunton - but he says that isn't always the case. When a new version comes out each September he does immerse himself in it - ""at the start you've got to put in a lot of hours and learn the game inside out, Then I play an unhealthy amount - maybe 10 hours a day."" But once he's learnt all the tricks of the new version he says he only plays on tournament days, three or four days a week. Now he's gearing up for Fifa 17, which arrives in September. West Ham now expects him to represent the club when he plays competitively, and to engage with their own fans who play Fifa. The club has just moved into the Olympic Stadium - now renamed the London Stadium - and its head of digital marketing Karim Virani says it was on the lookout for ways of boosting the West Ham brand: ""We are looking at options to engage and interact with our fanbase in new and inventive ways. E-sports is growing crazily - over 250 million people follow it globally."" Looking around the magnificent stadium he tells me he can foresee a day when it is filled with spectators for a video game. In fact that already happens in South Korea, where the final of a League of Legends tournament packed out a stadium in Seoul. But I'm not quite convinced that football teams looking to cash in on e-sports are backing the right game with Fifa because the real money is being made elsewhere. Even star players like Sean Allen are only making a relatively modest living from tournament prizes. The winner of the Fifa World Cup, the biggest contest in that game, earned $20,000 but the prize pool for the Dota 2 tournament this year amounted to $20m (£15m). And while star players of games like Dota 2 and League of Legends attract subscribers in their millions on Twitch, the streaming video service, only a few hundred sign up to follow star Fifa players. Still, both West Ham and Manchester City have seen a future where e-sports could pack out the Etihad or the London Stadium. Don't be surprised if transfer news in the future includes players whose skills are centred on their thumbs, not their feet. You can listen to Tech Tent on the BBC World Service at 16:00 BST - or catch the podcast.",I've been spending time this week off my usual beat with one of West Ham United's summer signings. Even diehard fans of the Premier League club may however be unfamiliar with Sean Allen. That's because Sean - also known as Dragonn - has made his name not as the new striker the Hammers need but as a champion player of the Fifa video game.
"Building work is set to commence in villages, market towns, and rural areas in the next 14 months, Openreach said Some 250,000 homes and businesses should benefit. The UK lags behind many other EU countries when it comes to broadband coverage. Last September, telecoms watchdog Ofcom said 8% of all UK premises were connected to full-fibre broadband. Full-fibre has the potential to offer much faster internet speeds than other alternatives. New locations to be connected by Openreach include Aberdare in South Wales and Saxmundham in Suffolk. Openreach is aiming to connect 15 million premises to full fibre broadband by the mid-2020s, but has warned it will only be able to do this with government help. The broadband industry has called on the government to scrap taxes for connecting businesses to full-fibre broadband. ""Currently, the biggest missing piece of this puzzle, is getting an exemption from business rates on building fibre cables, which is critical for any fibre builder's long-term investment case,"" said Openreach chief executive Clive Selley. Openreach has connected more than two million premises to full-fibre broadband and wants that figure to rise to four million by March 2021. ""We're now building at around 26,000 premises a week in over 100 locations - reaching a new home or business every 23 seconds That's up from 13,000 premises a week this time last year,"" said Mr Selley. Other broadband infrastructure providers include Sky and Virgin Media. Matthew Howett, founder of research firm Assembly, sympathised with Openreach's frustration over business rates. ""It's a barrier that the whole industry is behind removing,"" he said. ""Currently in England the exemption only lasts for five years, and 10 years in Scotland, but for the operators, the business case for rolling out fibre is over a much longer period, often over 15 years."" He also acknowledged that ""broadband, while digital, can still be a very analogue and labour-intensive job to install"". ""As much as 70% of the cost of rolling out broadband is in the civil works - the digging, manual labour and road closures that go with it. So, any innovations that reduce these costs will ultimately result in broadband being deployed faster, and to more people."" Openreach said it is using a range of tools, including ditch diggers and diamond cutters, to speed up the roll-out. Laying fibre can be disruptive, slow and expensive, so labour-saving devices can play an important role, it said. Tools helping to speed up the job include: The tools and techniques are not particularly new, according to Andrew Ferguson, editor of the thinkbroadband website. ""Openreach has been talking about and using some of these techniques for a while now, but with the expansion to more areas, no doubt there will be more use of these techniques,"" he said. ""It is important to point out that, where at all possible, existing ducts and poles are used. The three techniques mentioned have also been used by other full-fibre operators across the UK previously."" Broadband choices There are three main types of broadband connection that link the local telephone exchange to your home or office:","Openreach, the BT-owned operator of Britain's biggest broadband network, has announced plans to start rolling out ultrafast full-fibre broadband to 227 rural communities across the UK."
"The hijacked data was involved in the ""mining pools"" that generate virtual cash and keep track of who spent what. The thief directed the results of the mining and transaction tracking to his own server so he could cash in. Internal access to a Canadian ISP allowed the thief to divert traffic, said experts. The theft was uncovered by security researcher Joe Stewart, who was part of one of the mining pools that was hit by the thief. Mining pools underpin the way many different crypto currencies work. They involve people connecting up their home computers to process the information generated when virtual cash is spent, swapped or gifted. In return for doing this hard computational work, miners are regularly rewarded with freshly minted coins. By regularly diverting traffic passing between members of several different mining pools, the attacker was able to reap all the rewards for themselves, Mr Stewart told Wired. ""Some people are more attentive to their mining rigs than others,"" he said. ""Many users didn't check their set-ups for weeks, and they were doing all this work on behalf of the hijacker."" The targeted hijacks only lasted 30 seconds but that was long enough to trick the collaborating computers into handing over the results of their work to the attacker. At its height the attack netted more than $9,000 (£5,350) a day in bitcoins, dogecoins and worldcoins for the thief. The diversion was made possible by the attacker gaining access to the internal systems at a Canadian ISP from where they were able to tell net hardware to reroute traffic. The attack started in February but was shut down in May when it was detected.","More than $83,000 (£50,000) in virtual cash has been stolen by a thief who managed to hijack net traffic from 19 separate ISPs, say security experts."
"""Blender"" was trained using available public domain conversations which included 1.5 billion examples of human exchanges. The social media giant said 49% of people preferred interactions with the chatbot, compared with another human. But experts say training the artificial intelligence (AI) using a platform such as Reddit has its drawbacks. Numerous issues arose during longer conversations. Blender would sometimes respond with offensive language, and at other times it would make up facts altogether. Researchers said they hoped further models would address some of these issues. ""We believe that releasing models is essential to enable full, reliable insights into their capabilities,"" a Facebook spokesperson said. Artificial Intelligence expert Dave Coplin, chief executive of consultancy The Envisioners, said that Blender was a ""step in the right direction,"" but noted two fundamental issues that still need to be overcome. ""The first is just how complex it is to replicate all of the nuances of a human attribute, like the ability to hold a conversation, a skill that most three-year-olds can master,"" he told the BBC. ""The second is around the relationship with the data used to train the model and the results generated by the model. ""As great a platform as Reddit is, training algorithms based on the conversations you find there is going to get you a lot of chaff amongst the wheat."" Facebook also compared Blender's performance with the latest version of Google's own chatbot, Meena. It showed people two sets of conversations, one made with Blender and the other with Meena. Conversations included a wide range of topics including movies, music and veganism. Facebook said that 67% of respondents thought Blender sounded more human than Meena. ""We achieved this milestone through a new chatbot recipe that includes improved decoding techniques, novel blending of skills, and a model with 9.4 billion parameters, which is 3.6x more than the largest existing system. ""This is the first chatbot to blend a diverse set of conversational skills together in one system."" ""Building a truly intelligent dialogue agent that can chat like a human remains one of the largest open challenges in AI today.""","Facebook has launched a new chatbot that it claims is able to demonstrate empathy, knowledge and personality."
"BMW, Daimler, Ford and Volkswagen Group, including Audi and Porsche, say they will build 400 charging sites. The plug-in points will provide ultra-fast charging for cars along major roads. Tesla cars will not be able to use the charge points as they use different systems. The network will be based on combined charging system standard technology. Drivers will be able to top up using plugs charging at a speed of 350 kW, which is considerably faster than the current market leader. A statement from the car companies said their goal was the quick build-up of a sizeable number of stations in order to enable long-range travel for battery electric vehicle drivers. ""This is fantastic news, exactly what the industry needs,"" said Ben Lane, director of Zap-Map, an app which plots where electric-car owners can charge their cars in the UK. ""As batteries get bigger, the time needed to charge them is longer so more rapid chargers on the roads is a good thing."" Work on the network is expected to begin in 2017. Analysis: Theo Leggett, BBC business correspondent If there were no petrol stations, would you buy a petrol-powered car? Of course not. Daft question. But that is precisely the problem carmakers are facing in their efforts to bring electric cars into the mainstream market. Put simply, the infrastructure needed to recharge electric cars quickly and easily is lacking. That makes planning long journeys a logistical nightmare. It's a chicken-and-egg situation. Few people are likely to replace their conventional cars with electric ones until the charging infrastructure exists. But why would you bother to build an expensive charging network when it has no cars to service. So the move that has been announced by BMW, Daimler, VW Group and Ford is a very logical one. They can pool their resources and build a network which they can all use. Once the charging infrastructure is up and running, more people will be tempted to buy electric vehicles. All four manufacturers are investing heavily in the development of electric cars - to see off the twin threats of ever tighter exhaust emissions regulations and the giants of Silicon Valley potentially moving on to their patch. But can electric vehicles (EVs) ever be as practical as conventional cars? Tesla has shown with its supercharger network that fast charging is possible. It now takes about 40 minutes to bring a Model S up to 80% of a full charge. It wants to bring down the charging time further, to between five and 10 minutes. If the four carmakers can achieve something similar - and provide a sufficiently large charging network - then EVs still won't be quite as convenient as ""normal"" cars - but they won't be a million miles off either.","Several large car firms are working together to create a high-powered, electric-vehicle-charging network across Europe."
"By Kevin RawlinsonBBC News Malicious code sought to exploit vulnerabilities in users' systems and install malware, researchers found. If installed, that malware could give hackers control of users' computers, said one security consultant. A spokesman for the Jamie Oliver Group played down the seriousness of the problem and told the BBC that it had been fixed. According to Malwarebytes, unknown hackers either broke into Mr Oliver's site and placed malicious code there, or exploited existing code. The script would direct unsuspecting users to a Wordpress site that hosted yet more malicious code. That would then run an exploit kit that would seek to find vulnerabilities in any user's system and install malware called Dorkbot. 'Tricked' Online security consultant Graham Cluley said the hackers could then gain control of a user's system and direct fake searches. ""In other words, you may think you're googling but, in fact, you are being redirected against your will to search results that earn the attackers affiliate cash,"" he told the BBC. ""In addition, you may find that you are tricked into installing bogus security updates on your computer or told to ring what is claimed to be technical support - although you would actually be speaking to scammers after your credit card details."" According to a spokesman for Jamie Oliver, only 10 users had written to the site about the issue in the past couple of days. He said that a ""low-level malware problem"" was identified and dealt with and that the site was now ""safe to use"". The spokesman added: ""The Jamie Oliver website is regularly checked for vulnerabilities by both our in-house team and an independent third party, and they quickly deal with anything that is found. ""The team is confident that no data has been compromised in this incident, but if anyone is worried do please use the contact form on the site. ""We apologise to anyone who was at all worried after going on the site."" The spokesman confirmed that existing code on the site was modified by a hacker, but said the website team was still trying to work out when that had happened. 'Serious' The celebrity chef's site has 10 million visitors per month and is ranked 515th in Britain, according to an analyst. Mr Cluley said that its sheer popularity made the problem ""serious"". He said: ""Users would hope that there was tight security in place on the website to prevent this kind of attack from happening - but it appears that things went badly wrong on this occasion."" Jerome Segura, of Malwarebytes, uncovered the issue. He said that, during tests, the malware sought to exploit Adobe Flash, Microsoft Silverlight and Oracle Java. Mr Cluley advised users to run up-to-date antivirus software and the latest patches to secure applications. He added that users should avoid running their computers with admin privileges, ""as this is more attractive for attackers"".","Jamie Oliver's website was affected by a ""malware problem"", a spokesman for the celebrity chef has acknowledged."
"The 64-year-old executive, who sits on the board at Google’s parent company, Alphabet, said the tech giant was right to pursue opportunities in China, despite heavy criticism from senior US officials. ""The world is a very interconnected place,” Mr Schmidt told BBC Newsnight’s Emily Maitlis. ""There are many, many benefits interacting, among other things, with China.” General Joseph Dunford, who as chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff is the highest ranking American in uniform, said Google’s work ""indirectly benefits the Chinese military and creates a challenge for us in maintaining a competitive advantage"". Mr Schmidt dismissed the concern. ""That's like saying America makes pencils and pencils are used by the Chinese.” Chinese ambition Google has had a tumultuous history in China. It left the country in 2010 over concerns it was being by censored and cyber-attacked by Beijing, and instead set up an operation in Hong Kong. Mr Schmidt said he disagreed with that move. “I believed they would be better to stay in China, and help change China to be more open.” More recently, the company has been building a presence in the country once again, with an estimated 700 employees now working on advertising and other development. In 2017, it established the Google AI China Center, in Shanghai. Google exploring 'censored' China search app Leaks chip away at Google's secrecy on China Last year, reporting from The Intercept and New York Times revealed Google had been working on a project named Dragonfly, a search engine that would reportedly fall in line with Beijing’s requirements. It was highly controversial, and prompted high-profile resignations, and a letter of protest signed by 1,400 Google employees. The company has since said it was no longer working on the project. When asked why most Google employees only learned of Dragonfly via media reports, Mr Schmidt said he had no direct involvement in the project, but that “I can tell you that certainly the people who were building all these products knew about it”. Employee discontent Mr Schmidt ran Google as chief executive and chairman from 2001 to 2011, then executive chairman until 2015. He then became executive chairman of Alphabet, the company set up as Google’s parent. In that time, the Google's motto transitioned from, famously, “Don’t be evil” into “do the right thing”. Over the past 12 months, employee discontent has challenged that notion both internally and externally. Last November, staff at Google offices globally staged a walk-out over issues surrounding gender equality at the firm. The protest took place after a New York Times investigation discovered Google had quietly paid former executive Andy Rubin $90m in severance, despite there being a credible claim of sexual harassment made against him. Mr Schmidt told Newsnight the firm’s employees protested because they felt empowered. “Transparency is a virtue,” Mr Schmidt said. ""And the fact of the matter is that if we had tried to suppress this stuff it would have come out anyway. It's much better to encourage people to express their opinions. ""We would argue that [the protests show] our culture at work. Google is famously empowering of its employees and we want to hear from them. These are cases where the employees collectively felt very strongly about the decisions that the company had made.” A follow-up protest took place last month after organisers of November’s walk-out claimed they were being punished for their activism. ""My manager started ignoring me,” wrote Clare Stapleton, a Google employee in New York, in an internal memo obtained by Wired magazine. “My work was given to other people, and I was told to go on medical leave, even though I’m not sick.” Tax complaint Mr Schmidt stepped down as Alphabet’s chairman in 2017, but remained on the board. Last month, he said he would be leaving the firm altogether in June. Throughout his tenure, the tax affairs of Google - like other tech giants - have been under close scrutiny. The company has always maintained that it adheres to the tax laws in all of the countries that it operates in. Documents filed in the Netherlands showed Google moved 19.9 billion euros (£17.9bn, $22.7bn) to a shell company in Bermuda, a tax haven. Mr Schmidt told the BBC he was happy the company’s tax affairs were ethical. “We are required to follow the tax rules, and the tax rules allow that,” he said. ""When those tax rules change of course we will adopt them. But there is a presumption that somehow we're doing something wrong here. We’re following the global tax regime.” He added: “Would you like us to give more, voluntarily, to these governments? “I will defend the company and the way it works for a very long time.""","Former Google boss Eric Schmidt has defended the company’s record on multiple controversies: its work in China, its treatment of women, and its tax affairs."
"Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent@BBCRoryCJon Twitter While Twitter sent its chief executive Jack Dorsey, and chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg represented Facebook, Google only offered up its top lawyer. The senators wanted more star power in the form of company founder Larry Page or Google chief executive Sundar Pichai - and when they were unavoidably busy, the committee opted for an empty chair instead. Ms Sandberg is an accomplished speaker and once worked in Washington, so the fact that she survived the hearing relatively unscathed was not a surprise. She repeated the now familiar mantra that Facebook had made mistakes in not spotting Russian interference but was now employing hordes of staff to put things right. By contrast, many thought Twitter's Mr Dorsey - who described himself to the committee as ""someone of few words and typically pretty shy"" - would struggle to deal with the politicians' questions. In the event, his low droning voice seemed to lull them into submission, although he was forced to admit in a later hearing before another congressional committee that Twitter's algorithms had not always been impartial, reducing the visibility of 600,000 accounts for no clear reason. But time and again, the senators chose to thank the Twitter and Facebook executives for turning up and bemoaned the absence of Google. After the Intelligence Committee's hearing, our man Dave Lee spoke to the leading Democratic Senator Mark Warner, who was quick to attack Google. ""I would hope after Americans saw that empty chair, that somebody in Google's management or somebody on their board would come to their senses and say, 'hey we need to answer American policymakers' questions',"" he said. Among those questions would be just what Google was playing at in China, where it is apparently exploring providing a search engine that would comply with the Chinese authorities' censorship demands. Perhaps the firm's senior executives decided that the danger of being trapped into saying something that might come back to bite them was just too high. But they may have misjudged. Immediately after the Senate hearing, the US Department of Justice announced an inquiry into the activities of the social media firms. It said Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who may be keen to find an issue on which he can agree with President Donald Trump, was convening a meeting to ""discuss a growing concern that these companies may be hurting competition and intentionally stifling the free exchange of ideas on their platforms"". Until recently, Google has largely avoided the criticism over the handling of free speech and abusive content that has been directed at Twitter and Facebook. Now, with President Trump accusing it of bias in its search algorithm and senators on the warpath over their declined invitation, the company could find that US regulators are keen to follow the lead of the EU in examining its alleged anti-competitive practices, Also on this week's Tech Tent we meet the women trying to show that female tech entrepreneurs can thrive in Berlin. And actor or algorithm - is a computer-generated Donald Trump more convincing than a human impersonator? Listen in and find out.","Twitter and Facebook made the trip to Capitol Hill this week for a grilling by US senators - but it was the company which stayed away which copped most of the flak. On this week's Tech Tent, we ask whether Google made a huge tactical error in refusing to send one of its leaders to Washington."
"The operator said he had used his aircraft to survey the area, but ended up spotting the missing 82-year-old the old-fashioned way - with his eyes. Even so, he suggested the kit had helped speed up the search. Others, using dogs and helicopters, had failed to find Guillermo DeVenecia - who has Alzheimer's - after he went missing near Fitchburg, Wisconsin. There had been some reports, including on the BBC, that said Mr DeVenecia had been spotted by the drone itself. But the operator clarified what had happened. ""It was not the drone that actually spotted the missing man,"" David Lesh told the BBC. ""We were asked to search a large area of farmland with the drone. I covered three-quarters of it using three batteries, and the last quarter was a little too far for me to get good first-person view reception. ""We got into the car and drove to the other side of the property. As we pulled up to fly the drone one last time, we saw the man from our car a few hundred feet away. ""Had we had not seen him then, the drone would have seen him a few minutes later since he was in the search area we were given to look at. If nothing else, the drone helped us cover a huge area in a short amount of time that would have taken many volunteers hours to search."" A medical check revealed Mr DeVenecia was only mildly dehydrated after his three-day sojourn. He had thought he had only been out for a short walk. Court challenge The rescue comes at a time when the US air safety regulator is grappling with the issue of what kind of drone flights should be allowed. A week ago, the Federal Aviation Administration was defeated in a case in which it had tried to ban another search-and-rescue squad from using drones made out of styrofoam. Texas EquuSearch Mounted Search and Recovery Team - a volunteer force - has used unmanned aircraft on several occasions since 2005. ""To date, photographs taken by Texas EquuSearch volunteers using model aircraft have directly pinpointed the location of remains of 11 deceased missing people,"" its lawyer stated. ""The models have also helped direct volunteer resources in countless other searches - to help volunteers avoid hazards on the ground, to facilitate resource allocation to areas of greatest interest, and to save time during the crucial early hours of the search."" The FAA had tried to ground the aircraft on the basis of rules, dating from 2007, that bar commercial use of unmanned aircraft. However, a judge ruled that the FAA's use of an email, rather than a formal cease-and-desist letter, to inform the team its aircraft were grounded had been inappropriate. The agency subsequently told tech news site Ars Technica, that the court's decision had no impact on its authority to regulate the wider use of drones. However, in March a US court found that the FAA rules banning commercial use of drones were put into force illegally because it had not done enough to solicit comment from the public. The FAA has appealed against that decision. In addition, the FAA has said it will take another look at its rules governing drones and aim to put new rules in place by the end of 2015.",A drone operator has explained how he helped locate an elderly Wisconsin man who had been missing for three days.
"The touchscreen computers will be powered by its upcoming Windows 8 system and contain a choice of an Intel or ARM-based processor. It allows the firm to challenge Apple's bestselling iPad with a device that can run standard applications such as its own Office programs and Photoshop. But it puts Microsoft in competition with other manufacturers planning to release tablets designed for Windows 8. The company's chief executive, Steve Ballmer, said he had wanted to give the software ""its own companion hardware"". The devices have 10.6 inch (26.9cm) displays, built-in kickstands and are housed in magnesium cases - which the company described as the first of their kind. The ARM-based tablets are 9.3mm (0.4 inches) thick - slightly less than the iPad - and run the Windows RT version of the new system. The Verge reported that the chipset will be built by Nvidia . Third-party developers must rewrite programs from scratch to run on the system's Metro interface to work on these devices. The versions using Intel's x86 technology run Windows 8 Pro and are 13.5mm (0.5 inches) thick. These can run Metro and an updated version of the ""classic"" desktop meaning they can use software designed for earlier editions of Windows, although some programs will need to be updated to be compatible. The specifications mean the Surface tablets have bigger screens than the iPad but are heavier. Pen input A variety of accompanying covers can be attached using built-in magnets. They double as keyboards with trackpads. One version is flat while the other offers keys that can be depressed. The devices are also designed to work with a pen accessory using what the firm dubbed ""digital ink"". When the stylus is held close to the screen of the tablet it ignores touch-input from the users' hands and ""samples"" the ink at 600dpi (dots per inch). The ARM-based version will be available with either 32GB (gigabytes) or 64GB of storage. Microsoft said they would be priced at a similar rate to other tablets using the same type of processor built by other firms. It added that the Intel-based versions would be offered with either 64GB or 128GB of storage and would have price tags comparable to ultrabook laptops. Different chipsets One tech analyst told the BBC that other hardware makers were likely to feel aggrieved by the news. ""Microsoft can offer a competitive price for these specifications as it doesn't need to pay itself a licence for the Windows 8 software which other manufacturers will have to do, and that might make its PC and tablet-making partners unhappy,"" said Carolina Milanesi, research vice president at the technology consultants Gartner. She added that the firm appeared to have focused on a specific part of the market which wanted a more powerful device than the iPad. ""They seem to be be targeting a professional audience,"" she said. ""So they are going head-to-head with Apple within the corporate sector. Price will be key - these devices won't be at the bottom end of the market. They will probably let other manufacturers fight over that space."" By contrast the tech research firm Forrester said it thought the focus for ARM-based Surface tablets would be consumers, rather than the enterprise sector. But one of its analysts warned there was a risk customers would shy away if they found it confusing distinguishing between the two types of Windows 8 experience. This will be the first time Microsoft will offer a version of its PC system designed for chips based on ARM's architecture. ""Microsoft will be its own worst enemy in this market,"" blogged Sarah Rotman Epps . ""Consumers aren't used to thinking about chipsets. Choice is a key tenet of Windows, but too much choice is overwhelming for consumers. Apple gets this, and limits iPad options to connectivity, storage, and black… or white."" ARM's ambitions Despite the potential for confusion, British chip designer ARM said it was ""excited"" by the news. The firm's designs have already proved popular with smartphone makers, but Microsoft's support for its technology in Windows 8 offers it the potential to expand into a market dominated until now by Intel and AMD. ""This represents a significant milestone in Microsoft's journey to expand the support of the Windows operating system and embrace the ARM architecture,"" said Lance Howarth, the firm's vice president of marketing. ""With the Surface for Windows RT announcement we are delighted to see yet another example of this partnership in action which follows on from various Windows RT devices demonstrated at Taiwan's Computex show recently."" Intel said it was also ""pleased"" about Microsoft's move. ""Intel believes in and supports an open and healthy ecosystem that delivers a broad scale of innovation and choice in solutions and user experiences,"" a statement said. ""We also believe Windows 8 on Intel architecture will deliver the most complete experience with the best performance and compatibility across all computing platforms.""",Microsoft has unveiled Surface - its own-brand family of tablets.
"Eric Horvitz's position contrasts with that of several other leading thinkers. Last December, Prof Stephen Hawking told the BBC that such machines could ""spell the end of the human race"". Mr Horvitz also revealed that ""over a quarter of all attention and resources"" at his research unit were now focused on AI-related activities. ""There have been concerns about the long-term prospect that we lose control of certain kinds of intelligences,"" he said. ""I fundamentally don't think that's going to happen. ""I think that we will be very proactive in terms of how we field AI systems, and that in the end we'll be able to get incredible benefits from machine intelligence in all realms of life, from science to education to economics to daily life."" Mr Horvitz heads up a team of scientists and engineers at Microsoft Research's main lab at its parent company's Redmond headquarters. The division's work on AI has already helped give rise to Cortana - a voice-controlled virtual assistant that runs on the Windows Phone platform and will shortly come to desktop PCs when Windows 10 is released. Mr Horvitz said that he believed Cortana and its rivals would spur on development of the field. ""The next if not last enduring competitive battlefield among major IT companies will be artificial intelligence,"" he said. ""The notion that systems that can think, listen, hear, collect data from thousands of user experiences - and we synthesise it back to enhance its services over time - has come to the forefront now. ""We have Cortana and Siri and Google Now setting up a competitive tournament for where's the best intelligent assistant going to come from... and that kind of competition is going to heat up the research and investment, and bring it more into the spotlight."" 'Existential threat' Mr Horvitz's comments were posted online in a video marking his receipt of the AAAI Feigenbaum Prize - an award for ""outstanding advances"" in AI research. But while the Microsoft executive describes himself as being ""optimistic"" about how humans might live alongside artificial intelligences, others are more cautious. The physicist Prof Hawking has warned that conscious machines would develop at an ever-increasing rate once they began to redesign themselves. ""Humans, who are limited by slow biological evolution, couldn't compete, and would be superseded,"" he said. Elon Musk - chief executive of car firm Tesla and rocket-maker SpaceX - has also suggested AI poses the greatest ""existential threat"" humankind faces. ""With artificial intelligence, we are summoning the demon,"" he told an audience of students in October. ""In all those stories where there's the guy with the pentagram and the holy water, it's like yeah he's sure he can control the demon. Didn't work out."" The Spectrum computer's inventor Sir Clive Sinclair has gone even further, saying he believes it is unavoidable that artificial intelligences will wipe out mankind. ""Once you start to make machines that are rivalling and surpassing humans with intelligence, it's going to be very difficult for us to survive,"" he told the BBC. ""It's just an inevitability."" Several recent and forthcoming films have also focused on how people might handle the potential threat AI poses, including Ex Machina, Transcendence, Avengers: Age of Ultron, Chappie and Terminator Genisys. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Mr Horvitz voiced a preference for 2014's Her, charting the relationship of a flirtatious Cortana-like app and its owner. Privacy fears He did, however, acknowledge one concern: AI systems risk invading people's privacy, since they will become capable of making ever-deeper inferences about users by ""weaving together"" the mass of data generated by human activities. But, he added, AI itself might offer a solution to this problem. ""We've been working with systems that can figure out exactly what information they would best need to provide the best service for a population of users, and at the same time then limit the [privacy] incursion on any particular user,"" he said. ""You might be told, for example, in using this service you have a one in 10,000 chance of having a query ever looked at... each person only has to worry about as much as they worry about being hit by a bolt of lightning, it's so rare. ""So, I believe that machine learning, reasoning and AI more generally will be central in providing great tools for ensuring the privacy of folks at the same time as allowing services to acquire data anonymously or with only low probabilities of risk to any particular person.""","A Microsoft Research chief has said he thinks artificial intelligence systems could achieve consciousness, but has played down the threat to human life."
"Stuxnet was discovered in 2010 after investigations into malfunctions at many industrial plants and factories. Iran's nuclear enrichment efforts were hit hard by Stuxnet which targeted the devices that control delicate industrial processes. The fix comes as reports circulate of a fresh cyber attack on Iranian nuclear enrichment project. Burn out Stuxnet exploited loopholes in the software Siemens wrote to oversee the running of its programmable logic controllers - devices used in many industrial facilities to automate a production process. When a controller was infected with Stuxnet it made the motors it was typically connected to run out of control and burn out. This is believed to have been behind Iran's need to replace many of the centrifuges it was using in its Natanz uranium enrichment plant. Siemens has issued advisories saying it has updated the Simatic code in the controllers to remove the loopholes. It is not yet clear who created Stuxnet, but security researchers say it is so complex and tightly targeted that only a nation would be able to marshal the resources to put it together. Stuxnet is just one of several similar malicious programs created to attack industrial control systems. Experts speculate that many were made to slow down and disrupt Iran's nuclear production processes. Iran has regularly denied that the viruses have hit its nuclear programme. The Siemens update comes as security firm F-Secure received an email believed to have been sent by a scientist working at Iran's Atomic Energy Organization. In the message, the scientist said its plants at Natanz and Qom have been hit again by a worm. Top F Secure security researcher Mikko Hypponen said it had not been able to confirm any of the details in the message. However, digital detective work did reveal that the message had come from within the Atomic Energy agency. On 23 July, Iran issued a statement saying it had successfully ""confronted"" sophisticated malware and thwarted all the cyber attacks against the nation's infrastructure. Reza Taqipur, Iran's minister of communication and information technology, said it was sometimes hit by as many as two million cyber attacks a day, but its ability to deal with them was growing daily.",German engineering giant Siemens has issued a fix for the software loopholes used by the notorious Stuxnet worm.
"The device sends out two pulses instead of one, mimicking how dolphins pinpoint their prey. The twin inverted pulse radar (TWIPR) can distinguish between the electronics at the heart of an explosive and other ""clutter"" such as pipes or nails. Experts said the system ""showed promise"". The radar device has been developed by a team led by Prof Tim Leighton, of the University of Southampton, and scientists from University College, London. Strong signal Prof Leighton took his inspiration from the way dolphins are able to process their sonar signals to pinpoint prey in bubbly water. Some dolphins blow bubble nets around schools of fish to force them to cluster together. Their sonar would not work if they could not distinguish the fish from the bubbles. He wanted to see if the same technique would work with radio waves, and so developed a system that also sent out pulses in pairs. Traditional radar typically sends out just one pulse. The device his team came up with was just 2cm in size and cost less than £1 to put together. The second pulse has the reverse polarity of the first. This means that if it hits an electronic device, it turns the pulse into a positive, which in turn gives off a very strong signal. In tests the team applied the radar pulses to an antenna typical of the circuitry used in explosive devices, which was surrounded by ""clutter"" metals. The antenna showed up 100,000 times more powerfully than the other metal ""clutter"". Animal super-senses Such a device could also be extremely helpful in finding surveillance device as well as bombs, the team said. It could even help locate people buried after an avalanche or earthquake by detecting their mobile phones. ""Such technology could also be extended to other radiations, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and light detection and ranging (Lidar)... offering the possibility of early fire detection systems,"" said Prof Leighton. Gary Kemp, programme director at technology consultancy Cambridge Consultants, said that the system ""shows promise"". He said: ""We continue to take inspiration from the many animal super-senses found in nature, whether from the sophisticated echolocation techniques used by bats and cetaceans or the remarkable chemical detection ability of dogs and bees. ""Any technology that increases the probability of detecting IEDs [improvised explosive device] or buried earthquake victims while reducing false alarms will undoubtedly save lives,"" he added.",British engineers have taken inspiration from dolphins for a new type of radar that could help detect roadside bombs more easily.
"By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor Two sites offering hard-to-find gadgets at a discount were found to be using bogus checkout facilities that encourage customers to pay via a direct bank transfer. This prevents users from recovering funds if they have second thoughts. Police investigators have expressed frustration about Google's role. One officer who spent years investigating online crime told the BBC that the tech firm could introduce checks to better deter fraudsters, if it made this a priority. Google believes the sites were indeed engaged in fraudulent behaviour and told the BBC it had removed the ads involved. It said it would now make unspecified changes to its automated and human-based review processes. ""Our priority is to protect our users, and we continue to update our enforcement policies and technologies to target fraudulent and bad actors,"" a spokeswoman said. ""In 2019, our team took down approximately 2.7 billion bad ads."" Bogus payment box Both Techziox.com and Shopzeal.co.uk went offline after the BBC contacted them. They did not respond to requests for comment. The sites had earlier run ads for Oculus virtual-reality headsets, which are sold out or priced at a premium on most other sites. The two stores claimed to have the products in stock and priced them at 15-23% below the norm. In some cases, the ads took up most of the screen when viewed on a smartphone, increasing their chance of being clicked. This mirrored the tactics of an earlier suspected scam site - MyTechDomestic - which also placed ads for Oculus headsets and was flagged to Google earlier this week. But while MyTechDomestic only presented shoppers a way to pay by bank transfer, Techziox and Shopzeal both appear to provide an option to use a credit card. If selected, the tool asks for the card's details including its CVV security code, and displays a ""Powered by Stripe"" logo - referring to a California-based internet payment processor. However, Stripe told the BBC that the box was not linked to its system and it did not handle payments for the sites. An independent security researcher, who tracks scam sites, confirmed that the sites' code indicated the card details were instead sent to the stores' operators. In any case, when users tried to use the service, it brought up an error message saying: ""Unfortunately, this payment method is not possible for new customers. Please choose another payment method."" The only other choice was bank transfer, and both Techziox and Shopzeal presented details of the same account at a Swindon-based bank. This is a common tactic used by scam sites to obtain funds. In previous cases, the police have said scammers use personal accounts belonging to individuals who are either complicit or have been coerced into sharing their bank details, and the money is typically withdrawn straight away over the counter or via cash machines. The two sites were both built using Wordpress's web-publishing software, looked similar and listed the same team members alongside email addresses that did not work. However, they gave different residential addresses as their respective headquarters - one in Southampton the other in Huddersfield - and used different domain registrars. They also provided different VAT numbers. In both cases, HM Revenue and Customs said the details were invalid. 'Upsetting and wrong' Techziox appears to have been in operation for longer, and had been accused of being ""straight-up scammers"" by users of Trustpilot's review site. One customer, Nicky Jones, told the BBC her 15-year-old daughter attempted to buy an Oculus Quest after saving for a long time and doing jobs to earn the cash. ""My daughter searched online and this company came up, so we purchased the item. I sent emails to the company and I had no emails back,"" she said. ""The most upsetting thing is we have lost £329. I would never take this money from my daughter, so I have lost the money. [It's] upsetting how people can do this and get away with this. It's wrong."" According to Whois records, Techziox's site was set up using a Netherlands-based registrar on 18 April, while Shopzeal used a US-based registrar on 7 May. A security blogger who anonymously tracks electronics goods scams said: ""It's horrendous. This is the first time I've seen them use Google Shopping. Previously it was just Adwords."" Google Shopping lets advertisers use images as well as words and is typically more prominent, he noted. Scam sites can be ""difficult to identify,"" he added. ""But maybe Google shouldn't allow a website that's been registered in the last two months to be one of its Shopping results, if it wants to provide a trustworthy customer experience.""",Fresh evidence that scam stores are exploiting Google's Shopping service to appear at the top of its search results has been discovered by the BBC.
"By Chris FoxTechnology reporter The 24,518 bitcoins will be sold mostly in blocks of 2,000 - each with a market value of about £680,000. Ernst & Young, the firm organising the auction, said the bitcoins had been ""confiscated as proceeds of crime"" but did not elaborate on the case. One expert said the authorities had chosen a ""safe"" time to sell. Australian newspapers have previously reported that 24,500 bitcoins were seized by police in the state of Victoria in 2013, after a man was arrested for dealing illegal drugs online. In 2015, Victoria's Asset Confiscation Operations department ""confirmed it had recently taken possession of 24,500 coins and would try to make the most of it"", according to the Sydney Morning Herald. 'Significant amount' ""This is a significant amount of Bitcoin,"" Dr Garrick Hileman, economic historian at the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, told the BBC. ""It's about a week's worth of new Bitcoin that comes onto the market through mining."" Currently about 4,000 new bitcoins are generated a day, as a reward for ""miners"" who offer their computer power to process Bitcoin transactions. The seized coins are auctioned in blocks because quickly selling a large number of coins for cash at a Bitcoin exchange could negatively affect the market. ""Generally the view is that any time 10,000 bitcoins sell, the market price can be moved significantly,"" said Dr Hileman. The price of Bitcoin rose to $530 (£362) on Friday, its highest level since August 2014. Dr Hileman said the Australian authorities had chosen a ""safe"" time to sell because there is some uncertainty about what will happen to the value of Bitcoin in July. ""The Bitcoin protocol is designed to reduce the number of new bitcoins miners are given as a reward for processing transactions every four years. ""The reward will be halved on 14 July, so prices could go up due to the reduced supply of new bitcoins. ""But there is a question about whether security could decline, if rewards for miners are reduced significantly. So it's a safe time to sell, as there is no guarantee about what might happen in July."" 'Set a precedent' The Australian Bitcoin auction, which will be open to bidders worldwide, is the first such sale outside of the US. In 2014, the US Marshals Service began auctioning a collection of about 175,000 bitcoins that had been confiscated from the founder of internet marketplace Silk Road. The final auction of those bitcoins attracted 11 bidders, possibly due to the high cost of each block on sale. Dr Hileman said the sale of Bitcoin by the Australian authorities was an acknowledgement that the cryptocurrency was not illegal. ""Any time a government sells Bitcoin, it is acknowledging that this is a different asset to drugs, for example, that would not be sold in an auction,"" he told the BBC. ""That was one of the big takeaways from the US Marshal Service auction - they set a precedent that Bitcoin was not illegal. ""Australia has been going through its own regulatory process - and this makes a standing that Bitcoin is legal to use in Australia.""","A collection of bitcoins worth about £8m, which had been confiscated by police in Australia, will be auctioned off in June."
"By Tse Yin LeeBBC Monitoring The Oxford Internet Institute (OII) has studied such discussions related to nine places - US, Russia, Ukraine, Germany, Canada, China, Taiwan, Brazil and Poland - on platforms including Twitter and Facebook. It claims that in all the elections, political crises and national security-related discussions it looked at, there was not one instance where social media opinion had not been manipulated. Bots in propaganda Bots - programs that perform simple, repetitive tasks - are integral to what the OII calls ""computational propaganda"" - instances of people deliberately distributing misleading information on social media by various means. Bots can communicate with people - retweeting fake news, for example - but they can also exploit social network algorithms to get a topic to trend. They can be fully or only partly automated. A single individual can use them to create the illusion of large-scale consensus. They can also be used to stifle critics by mobbing individuals or swamping hashtags. The methods the OII used for identifying bots in each country study varied. The institute has, however, been criticised in the past for identifying social media accounts as being ""bots"" whose owners insisted they were nothing of the kind. 'Anyone can launch a bot on Twitter' Bots are built by authoritarian governments, by corporate consultants who hire out their expertise, or by individuals who have the know-how, says the OII. ""Because the Twitter API [application programming interface - the means by which one bit of software can talk to another] is open, anyone can launch a bot on Twitter,"" explained director of research for the project, Samuel Woolley. See also: One in eight UK election Twitter links is 'junk' Massive networks of fake accounts found on Twitter Clinton bots 'hit back in second debate' While bot and other propagandistic behaviour was specific to the political context of each country, the study also identified several trends. In every country, it said, civil society groups struggled to protect themselves against misinformation campaigns. And in authoritarian countries, it added, social media was one of the key ways the authorities had tried to retain control during political crises. The frontline of disinformation Computational propaganda has been particularly prevalent in Ukraine, the research suggests. There had been ""significant Russian activity... to manipulate public opinion"" the report said, adding that Ukraine had become ""the frontline of numerous disinformation campaigns"" since 2014. The typical way this worked, it explained, was that a message would be placed in an online news outlet or blog's article. This was possible, it said, ""because a large number of Ukrainian online media... publish stories for money"". These would then be spread on social media via automated accounts and potentially picked up in turn by ""opinion leaders"", with large followings of their own. With enough attention, the message would ultimately be picked up by mainstream media, including TV channels. The study provides an example related to the shooting down of Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 in 2014 to illustrate how such campaigns work. A conspiracy theory claiming that the plane was shot down by a Ukranian fighter jet originated with a tweet from a non-existent Spanish air traffic controller, called Carlos (@spainbuca). The post was then retweeted by others and was picked up by Russia's RT television network as well as other Russian news outlets. Ukraine's information ministry later revealed the account had been used to retweet pro-Russian messages earlier in the year. In Russia itself, the OII suggested that about 45% of politics-focused Twitter accounts were highly automated, ""essentially reproducing government propaganda"". 'Tools against democracy' It remains difficult to quantify the impact such bots have had. But the OII's researchers believe that ""computational propaganda is now one of the most powerful tools against democracy"". They have called on social media firms to do more to tackle the issue. Lead researcher Prof Philip Howard proposed several steps that could be taken by the tech firms, including: Prof Howard cautioned, however, that governments must be careful not to over-regulate the technology for fear of suppressing political conversation on social media altogether. In response, Twitter reissued a statement saying that third-party research into bots on its platform was ""often inaccurate and methodologically flawed"". It added that it strictly prohibited bots and would ""make improvements on a rolling basis to ensure our tech is effective in the face of new challenges"". A spokeswoman from Facebook was unable to provide comment.","If you've been chatting about politics on social media recently, there's a good chance you've been part of a conversation that was manipulated by bots, researchers say."
"By Zoe KleinmanTechnology reporter Research suggests women across the world have shouldered more family and household responsibilities than men as the coronavirus pandemic continues, alongside their working lives. And they share their inspirations, frustrations but also their optimism. ""I have a new business and a new life,"" says Clare Muscutt, who lost work, her relationship and her flatmate as lockdown hit. This Tuesday is Ada Lovelace Day - an annual celebration of women working in the male-dominated science, technology, engineering and maths (Stem) sectors. And, this year, it has a very different vibe. Varsha Amin, technology and digital skills coach, Hampshire Initially it felt like business was paused. Confidence went. I've now gone fully online. The tech is there to support it. And weirdly, I think I've benefited from it. I'm booking up months ahead. The digital skills gap is costing the economy billions. People, and even entire corporations, are so far behind. Then, you add in the complication of Covid. And you think everything is going to go backwards. But actually, digital is growing exponentially. I'm dyslexic, so I have relied on tech to help get me where I am today. I'm a firm believer that tech can really enable anyone from anywhere to start their own business and make it fly. My husband is a neuroscientist. When Covid first hit, he was redeployed to the front line. And we had no childcare. There were days when I sat in front of my laptop and cried. Getting the right balance is difficult. In September, my daughter started school. In the future, when she becomes more independent, I will go all out on my business. Jess Ratty - entrepreneur, technology public-relations company founder, Cornwall There is absolutely no doubt that this has been the hardest year of my life. I lost 40% of my business in two days, at the start of lockdown. I had worked so hard to get to where I had got to. And I was filled with fury that a pandemic had taken it away. Every pitch we get, I throw as much energy at the screen as possible. I find myself working longer hours to be more visible to my clients. I am driven by this fear that next week I could lose another couple. But I have now got 60% more business back in. I'm used to working from home. But the biggest problem was having my eight-year-old daughter suddenly with me 24/7, when the schools closed. We all knew it might come. But when it did, it happened so fast. It was really difficult having to work and do childcare at the same time. Before lockdown, I would have said it was impossible. I'm embarrassed to say that she spent a lot of time watching Netflix and Disney+. But I am the breadwinner. And my partner was working full time on our house renovation because, until it was finished, we were living in a static caravan. I'm now launching a new business, this time in edtech [education technology]. I'm looking to do as many things as possible to protect those closest to me and prepare for the next ""impossible thing"" to happen. Clare Muscutt, digital customer experience entrepreneur, Essex What I used to do doesn't exist anymore. I had the life and career of my dreams. And I had left the corporate world to do it. As soon as the pandemic hit, my diary just emptied. The clients I had work booked with shut down any unnecessary spend. Then, my relationship ended. My best friend moved out of our flat. And suddenly, the only contact I had with others was through Zoom. I started having conversations with women in a similar field to me. And we started sharing how we were feeling. It made me think: ""How can I bring this style of conversation to the world, to help inspire others?"" And that led me into podcasting. After a bad experience, I taught myself how to do the production. And it has led to me being paid to interview tech leaders elsewhere. My bills are now getting paid. And the podcast is helping me to form an online community. Before the pandemic, I was living for the future - always looking forward to the next big event or trip away. Now, I don't know what the future holds or whether things will ever go back to the way they were. But if they don't, it's OK - I have a new business and a new life. Rebecca, cyber-security specialist, Ireland I have worked from home before. And at the start of lockdown, I didn't think it would be that much of a big deal. But it turned out that working from the kitchen table was very uncomfortable. Eventually, I finally got an old desk from a friend. And I was so happy. Since lockdown began, I've seen quite a few cyber-security issues with phishing and invoice re-direction - when a malicious actor gets hold of a legitimate invoice and resends it but changes the bank details. Sometimes, it's small amounts here and there, sometimes large amounts. It's often difficult to recover the money. I'm also four months pregnant with our first child. I need new clothes. But if you go to the shop you can't try anything on. And I have no idea what size I am. Plus, I am limited in the times I can go out. I don't drive. It has to fit around work. And we can't go at busy times, because standing in long queues is so exhausting. I feel like I've lost my independence. In addition, they haven't yet figured out how they are going to hold antenatal classes. I feel like I won't meet any other parents until my kid starts school. Claire Broadley, technical writer, Leeds Before lockdown, my husband and I ran our own company, producing user guides and written content for websites. Business income dropped by about two-thirds during lockdown. We weren't eligible for any government grants. And because we still had a small amount of work, we couldn't furlough ourselves. It felt like we were slowly marching our family towards a cliff edge. In May, to my astonishment and relief, I was offered my dream job, remote writing about the internet and technology. Working from home with the children has been the most difficult thing we've ever done. My son is seven. He is very scared. Sometimes, we can't spend the time with him that we would like to. And most screen-time rules have gone completely out of the window. The real issue for us now is testing. My young daughter caught Covid in July. And she recently had a temperature again. But it took six days to get a test result, so my son was off school again. And my husband was working until midnight to fit everything in. Suw Charman-Anderson, founder, Ada Lovelace Day, US For Ada Lovelace Day, we usually hold a cabaret-style event in central London. Instead, we are holding five free webinars and have organised a 50-hour online extravaganza, with blog and social media posts and a YouTube playlist. In November, we're running our first online conference, which will span 29 time zones. I've had to find and evaluate livestreaming services and conference platforms, something that I've never had to consider before. It's been quite stressful working out how to run our online events affordably and dealing with the additional work involved. Our income has been badly affected by the pandemic as companies have less money to spend on event sponsorship, so we're also having to think about how we're going to make up that shortfall. Despite that, I'm really excited by what we're doing. Covid forced us to rethink everything. And some of the changes we've made may become permanent. 2020 has been a hard slog. And we're not out of the woods yet. But I hope we'll emerge stronger and able to reach and support more women in Stem.","From caravans to kitchen tables, and podcast production to pregnancy, I've been speaking to many women in and around the technology sector about how they have adapted to the challenges of working during the coronavirus pandemic."
"By Chris BaraniukTechnology reporter Hacking tools allegedly developed by the US National Security Agency (NSA) were dumped online by a group calling itself Shadow Brokers. It follows a string of recent leaks of data from the Democratic National Committee (DNC). There are also now suspicions that the Clinton Foundation, a charitable body, may have been targeted. Is this part of a Russian campaign to damage the US and even influence the presidential election in November, or are things a little more complicated than that? What is in the latest leak? Analysis of the files released by Shadow Brokers has revealed a group of malware that can be used to hack US-made firewalls and routers. Indeed, the tech firms Cisco and Fortinet have warned customers that there are some serious exploits in the dump that affect their products. Juniper Networks has also said it is reviewing the data to see if its devices are affected. There are fears that some of the exploits were ""zero-day"" vulnerabilities, meaning they had gone undetected. The hacking tools are believed to belong to a group of malware developed by ""The Equation Group"", which was first revealed by cybersecurity firm Kaspersky in 2015. ""On the basis of what we've looked at, we certainly believe that there's a connection to the Equation Group malware,"" said David Emm, Kaspersky's principal security researcher, told the BBC. ""I've thought from the very beginning that it was real,"" added Mikko Hypponen at security company F-Secure. ""The sheer amount of data would be very hard to fake."" How did the information get out? For Mr Hypponen and many others, this is ""the real mystery"". No-one really knows how this information was acquired, though there has been speculation that a server operated by the NSA may have been hacked. Another theory, put forward by former NSA employee David Aitel, is that an insider decided to steal the data. Whether the same insider then went on to leak it is yet another unanswered question. Is this connected to other recent dumps? In June, it was reported that a hacker going by the moniker of ""Guccifer 2.0"" had released a cache of DNC members' emails. The resulting fallout led to the resignation of DNC chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Then, earlier this month, Guccifer published another wave of allegedly hacked data, including the personal contact details of nearly 200 current and former members of Congress from the Democratic Party. Russia has been accused by US officials of being involved in the DNC leaks; an accusation that Russia has vehemently denied. Either way, President Obama has already said that Russian involvement would not have a significant impact on his diplomatic relationship with the Russian President Vladimir Putin. Is this an attempt to derail the presidential election? Despite Obama's public comments that his relationship with Putin would not be strained, the hacks come at a particularly sensitive time. With an election in November, some have speculated that the leaks are an attempt to somehow influence the result of the vote. ""I think it's more likely that if this is indeed the Russian state, then what they want to do is simply cast doubts on the validity of the electoral process,"" said Nigel Inkster at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London. Conversely, in February Mr Putin warned that ""foes abroad"" might try to influence Russia's September elections. It is worth remembering that, in July, Russia announced that about 20 Russian government organisations had been targeted by spyware, though it stopped short of attributing the infiltration to any specific state or actor. Analysis: Gordon Corera, security correspondent Cyberspying is an inherently murky world. The nature of cyberspace makes it easy to hide your tracks and obscure your identity. And there is a difference between traditional espionage - stealing information secretly - and releasing information publicly - something more akin to information warfare. Stealing information is age-old but so is the release of information to undermine your opponent. During the Cold War, the USA and USSR both engaged in what were often called ""influence operations"" or ""political warfare"" - spreading information or disinformation or propaganda about individuals or political parties or ideas. Cyberspace only offers a new way of doing this. So is there some kind of cyber-information battle going on between Washington and Moscow now? Perhaps. But, if so, it may be hard to prove and both sides may be happy - as in the past - for this to be fought without the information war ever being formally acknowledged. Can Obama comment? The US President has not yet made a public statement promising retribution for the apparent hack of an American intelligence agency. And some believe he can't. Mr Obama recently clarified how the United States would respond to a cyber attack, Mr Inkster noted. ""These set out criteria for determining how serious an incident is and, by extension, what retaliatory measures would be justified,"" he told the BBC. ""So to say this is an incident of a certain level of importance and we're confident the Russian state did it - that puts the United States in a position of, 'Well, what are you going to do about it?'"" Are members of the public at risk? According to Mr Hypponen, the exploits released in the dump of hacking tools are not likely to implicate members of the public. ""There's a bit of an impact to companies using routers and firewalls,"" he noted, but end users would probably not have to take any action.","Huge leaks of data from US organisations have been attributed by some to Russia, so has the former Soviet state launched cyberwar on the US elections?"
"In some cases, ISPs are advertising services as fibre that rely on slower copper wires for the final link to a customer's home. The probe has been prompted by consumer complaints and calls from MP Matt Warman to investigate. Mr Warman said ISPs were misleading customers by giving them copper when they expected fibre. Misled? In a statement, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said it was acting because of ""evolving concerns"" about the way fibre broadband services were advertised, and recent changes to government policy, which meant far more people would potentially have access to such services. Policy papers spelling out the government's view made clear that fibre should be used only to describe services that rely on the faster cables from end to end, it said. The ASA said it would consider whether ISPs should be able to continue using ""fibre broadband"" to describe both full and part-fibre services. ""We will be considering whether the use of that term is likely to cause people to be materially misled,"" it said. The ASA did not say when it would complete its work but said it would provide an update by the summer. James Blessing, chair of the council at the UK's Internet Service Providers Association said it had been ""working with the ASA on their wider review into broadband advertising to ensure that adverts are understood by consumers and help them make informed choices about the services, products and technologies that best suit their needs."" He said ISPA ""looked forward"" to helping the ASA's review of what the word ""fibre"" means in adverts. Andrew Ferguson, co-founder of the ThinkBroadband website, said ""clarity"" on advertising would be welcome. ""Then we can avoid adverts that promote fibre optic broadband but clearly show a coax cable with a metal core,"" he said. Telecoms watchdog Ofcom offers an app that can help consumers check broadband speeds and availability. Commercial sites. such as ThinkBroadband and USwitch, have also made tools that let people check deals and speeds available.","The UK's advertising watchdog is looking into the way so-called ""fibre broadband"" services are marketed."
"Microsoft said Russian citizen Andrey Sabelnikov ""wrote and/or participated in creating"" the Kelihos software which infected thousands of machines. However, Mr Sabelnikov contacted the BBC to say he was ""surprised and shocked"" at the accusation, adding: ""I will prove my innocence."" Microsoft said it stood by the accusation it made earlier this month. ""As this is a case pending in court, we cannot comment further except to say that we look forward to seeing Mr Sabelnikov in court so we can continue this discussion,"" said Richard Boscovich, senior attorney for Microsoft's Digital Crime Unit. Microsoft named Mr Sabelnikov, who is a former employee of antivirus company Agnitum, in court papers filed in the US. The software giantclaimed their own investigations uncovered proofthat Mr Sabelnikov ""used the malware to control, operate, maintain and grow the Kelihos botnet"". 'Grievous crime' In a blog post, Mr Sabelnikov said the allegations were unfounded. ""I was very surprised and shocked to read in the press that I was being accused of a grievous crime in connection with the Kelihos botnet,"" he wrote. ""I am absolutely not guilty, have never been involved in handling botnets or any other similar programmes and what is more have never made any profit from such activity. I want to highlight that I have no connection either to the activity of Kelihos or to the distribution of spam. ""Unfortunately, the avalanche of publications in the press, referencing inaccurate and distorted information, has inadvertently inflicted a great deal of psychological damage on the companies for whom I have worked or am working, and also adversely affected their business reputation."" Botnets like Kelihos are created by the spread of malicious software, often via infected emails or web browser vulnerabilities. Each ""bot"", as they are known, is a hijacked computer which can be used by hackers for any number of illegal activities. The Kelihos botnet was used for sending out spam and spreading malware until it was ""neutralised"" in September 2011. At its peak, it was said to have been in control of 41,000 infected machines and able to send over 3.8 billion spam emails in a day.","The man accused by Microsoft of being behind a huge botnet attack has insisted he is ""absolutely not guilty""."
"Requests to the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (Icann) include .porn, .ninja, and .ferrari. The BBC was among the applicants , applying for .bbc as an alternative to .co.uk and .com. Several top-level domains have been applied for by more than one party, including .sex, .home and .diy. Both the US drugmaker Merck & Co and its German rival Merck KGaA appear to have applied for the .merck ending, which may trigger an auction process. However the .uk manager, Nominet, looks likely to secure .wales and .cymru after no-one filed identical claims. Likewise the Dot Scot Registry was the only organisation to apply for .scot and the League of Arab States the only body to claim .arab. Objections Samsung - which had objected to the process - has taken part, applying for both .samsung and its equivalent in the Korean alphabet. However, Coca-Cola and the cereal manufacturer Kellogg's, which also signed a petition in protest , have abstained. By contrast Google has applied for dozens of the generic top-level domain (gTLD) name strings. Obvious choices included .google and .youtube, but there were also unexpected inclusions such as .and, .boo, .dad and .new. The search giant has also requested .music, which has been claimed by seven other organisations including the online retailer Amazon. Other gTLDs attracting multiple requests include .art, .book, .news, .play, .shop and .vip. The most contested name is .app which received 13 applications. Icann said that it had received a total of 1,930 requests for its first round of new net names - 166 of them were in alternatives to the Latin alphabet. It has now invited anyone with an objection to any of the claims to lodge their complaint within the next seven months. Icann then aims to make the new domains live in batches of about 500, with the first set going live some time after March 2013. ""The plan we have delivered is solid and fair,"" said Icann's chief executive, Rod Beckstrom. ""It is our fundamental obligation to increase innovation and consumer choice."" However, critics have attacked the plan, noting the costs involved and the fact that bodies in the first batch to be processed may gain an unfair advantage. Nations including Brazil, China and Russia have also suggested Icann's functions be passed to the UN or another body more under governments' control. Expenses Applicants had to pay a $185,000 (£118,800) fee to take part in the application process. They also face a minimum $25,000 annual renewal charge to keep their suffix once it has been granted. That may have discouraged some public bodies from participating, but the BBC's controller of research and development, Matthew Postgate, defended the broadcaster's involvement. ""This is an important extension of the BBC's brand-protection policies,"" he said. ""In the future the use of .bbc domains might ensure content is even easier to access and navigate for our audiences, clearly identified as coming from the BBC, or more secure and scalable."" The BBC's domestic rivals Sky and ITV have also applied for a suffix, as have the American broadcasters ABC and CBS. However, CNN and PBS abstained. One internet brand consultant noted that the business world appeared to be split over the perceived benefits of having one of the names. ""While Next and Boots are investing in a .brand for their online retail future, all the other big British retailers missed the boat,"" said Stuart Durham from Melbourne ITDBS. ""The big names of the internet have either invested massively or not at all. Amazon for example has applied for 76 names, Google for 101 and Microsoft 11. But there's no applications from Facebook or Twitter. ""There are different strategies in play here and some big gambles.""",The full list of submissions for new internet address endings has been published by the global organisation co-ordinating the expansion.
"Reyes Daniel Ruiz admitted he had ""hacked"" about 6,000 accounts, seeking sexual images and videos. The US Department of Justice said Ruiz had ""cracked"" user passwords and accessed internal Yahoo systems while hunting for pornography. Ruiz also used access to Yahoo accounts to target other online services users had signed up for. In a statement, the DoJ said the access Ruiz had attained to Yahoo user data had helped him ""compromise"" Apple iCloud, Facebook, GMail, Dropbox and other online accounts. And he had used his access to the accounts to reset passwords so he could access the other systems. Ruiz had targeted friends, co-workers and many young women during his hacking campaign, the DoJ said. He had copied many of the images and videos he had found and kept the material at his home. And soon after Yahoo discovered his activities, in 2018, Ruiz had destroyed the computer and hard drives on which the stolen data had been stored. Ruiz was charged in April this year and has now signed an agreement with the DoJ which will see him pleading guilty to one count of computer intrusion. He is due to be sentenced in February 2020. The maximum jail term for computer intrusion is five years plus a fine of $250,000 (£203,000) and damages.",A former Yahoo software engineer has pleaded guilty to charges of illegally accessing user accounts.
"By Clara Guibourg and Nassos StylianouData journalists, BBC News Women inventors account for just under 13% of patent applications globally, according to the study, by the UK's Intellectual Property Office (IPO). That's one female inventor for every seven male ones. And although the proportion among patent applications is increasing, at the current rate it won't reach gender parity until 2070. So, why are there so few women in the world of inventing? Researchers attribute the gap to a lack of women working in science, technology, engineering and maths (Stem). According to Penny Gilbert, partner at intellectual property law firm Powell & Gilbert, it's simply a pipeline issue. ""If we want to see more women filing patents, then we need to see more women taking up Stem subjects at university and going on to careers in research,"" she says. Currently only about a quarter of the UK workforce in Stem industries is female and fewer girls and women study these subjects at secondary school and university, despite efforts to diagnose and solve this imbalance. Two-thirds of applications still all-male Patents are granted to the owner of an invention, allowing the creator and subsequent owners to prevent others from using their invention. In order to qualify as an ""invention"" patent, the filing must contain a new, useful idea - that would not be obvious to a skilled person in that field. They can be filed individually, or by teams of inventors. The gender disparity among inventors grows even starker when you take into account most female inventorship takes the form of a lone female on a male-dominated team. More than two-thirds of all patents come from all-male teams or individual male inventors - and just 6% from individual female inventors. All-female teams are nearly non-existent, making up just 0.3% of applications, according to the IPO. Even when they apply for patents, women may be less likely to receive them, according to a study of US patent applications, by Yale University researchers. They found applicants with an obviously female name were less likely to have their patent approved. And of course, not everyone involved in an invention is credited with a patent. All in all, female scientists are less than half as likely to obtain a patent for their research, according to a previous World Intellectual Property Organisation study, suggesting women may be less likely than men to think about commercialising their inventions. Biotech the most gender equal In 1991, Ann Tsukamoto developed a way to isolate stem cells. Her innovation led to great advancements in understanding the blood systems of cancer patients and could lead to a cure for the disease. Dr Tsukamoto, who is currently conducting further research into stem cell growth, is also the co-patentee on more than seven other inventions. Biotechnology, the use of living organisms to produce useful products such as medicine and food, is the sector with the highest proportion of female inventors. Some 53% of biotechnology-related patents have at least one female inventor. In second place, 52% of pharmaceutical-related patents have at least one female inventor. Electrical engineering was at the bottom of the list, with fewer than one in 10 applications having at least one female inventor. Parity by 2070 The proportion of women inventors has doubled in the past 20 years, according to the IPO, from just 6.8% in 1998 to 12.7% in 2017, the latest year for which full data is available. During the same period, the proportion of applications naming at least one woman among the inventors rose from 12% to 21%. Dr Gilbert says stereotypes around women's educational and career choices need to be tackled - by encouraging women to choose Stem areas, introducing mentoring schemes, and celebrating female role models. ""We should applaud the fact that some of the greatest scientists and inventors throughout history have been women - from Marie Curie and Rosalind Franklin to Grace Hopper, [a computer programming pioneer], and Stephanie Kwolek, the inventor of Kevlar,"" she says. ""We should tell their stories."" Russia tops the list Although female inventorship in the UK has increased, from 8% in 1998 to 11% in 2017, other countries are well ahead. With 17% of patent applications including at least one woman over the past 20 years, Russia had the highest proportion of female inventors, out of the 10 countries with the most patent applications, followed by France. At the other end of the scale, in Japan and South Korea fewer than one in 20 patent applications included a female inventor during the time period. How was the data collected? The gender of inventors is usually not included in patent applications, so the IPO inferred gender based on inventors' first names, using data from the European Patent Office Worldwide Patent Statistical Database (PATSTAT). Inventors' names were matched to a gender using birth data from the UK's Office for National Statistics and the US Social Security Administration, which lists the names of all babies born, and the number of male and female entries, as well as by crawling Facebook profiles to create a larger list of names and their likely gender. Only names for which at least 95% of entries were male or female were included, so gender-neutral names such as ""Robin"" have been excluded. A total of 75% of inventors' names were matched to a gender, although this success rate varies country by country. The name lists used were biased towards Western names, so the UK has the highest ""success rate"", while countries in East Asia, including South Korea and China, have a lower rate. What is 100 Women?

"It's not the easiest of jobs. Facebook is launching its Portal video chat devices off the back of two data breach scandals, the most recent of which still has many unanswered questions. But Andrew Bosworth is about as wired into Facebook's culture as you can get. He jumped ship from Microsoft at the start of 2006 - less than two years after Facebook's launch - and has since been instrumental in creating its News Feed, leading its Messenger and Video Call teams and heading up its advertising efforts. These days his formal title is vice-president of augmented reality and virtual reality, but he is probably better known to the public as the author of Facebook's ""ugly truth memo"", which leaked in March. It suggested that the social network believed ""so deeply"" in connecting people that anything that made it possible was good, even if people died as a consequence. Mr Bosworth later said he had meant to be provocative but did not believe what he had written. He met with the BBC's technology desk editor Leo Kelion last week, ahead of Portal's launch. These are edited highlights from the conversation: You've just had another data breach scandal. Do you think that's going to put people off Portal? From the very beginning, we knew that when you introduce a new product category into someone's home, you have to put privacy and security first. So, that's been from the ground up on this device. Shipping a camera cover with the tool, the fact that we do all the processing locally - we're proud of that from an engineering standpoint. We've done all the processing locally on the device so that it doesn't send that information to the cloud, or is never stored on Facebook servers. But I understand it doesn't use end-to-end encryption, so if the authorities came along and said Facebook, we want to be able to listen to this suspect's video calls, that would be technically possible for you to do. The calls are encrypted in the same way they are on Messenger. And for now that's been something that for all the people who have adopted Messenger, has been a standard of privacy and security that they've come to expect. And that's what we're delivering on this device. The prices at which you are launching Portal wouldn't seem to give you a chance of making a big profit from the hardware. Should we therefore suspect that given enough time, you'll add some kind of advertising? We have no plans to add advertising to this and we have no ambition to make money on this piece of hardware right now. Right now, we are exploring a new product space and we're going to see if this is the kind of thing that resonates with people and delights them as much as we hope it will. I understood there were plans to launch this a while back and then the Cambridge Analytica scandal came along. I read those rumours too... We had always been planning on a fall (autumn) launch. Behind all this is Facebook's desire to connect people in different ways. But is that necessarily a good thing? Your controversial memo defended the idea, but making people super-connected can have unintended consequences, including the spread of fake news. These devices are relatively focused on the networks that [users have] already built out on Messenger. More broadly for Facebook, we've always worked to identify the harm that can come from the products. I certainly regret not spending more time on that, in what was a not very thoughtful expedition that ended up getting exposed publicly, That did not really demonstrate how much we have invested historically in identifying the harm. But that's the kind of thing that we had to really redouble our efforts on over the last year, obviously. We still remain as vigilant as we can be, but optimistic that finding people meaningful connections that are important to them - whether friends and family or communities that are particularly meaningful that they're motivated by - is a good thing for people to have access to and will decrease loneliness and isolation over the long-term. Some studies suggest that when young people use Facebook, Instagram and other social media and see a glimpse of others' lives that appear fantastic, it can make them feel unhappy and more lonely. Are you aware of this risk? We shared research ourselves in January that there are certainly uses of social media that are deleterious, and there are uses that we think are really positive. And what you've seen over the course of the last year is Facebook reacts to that information by really trying to change the way the product expressed itself to people, moving towards meaningful social actions. In the research that we've seen, this shows a much more positive impact on how people feel in their wellbeing. We certainly take tremendous responsibility for the impact that we've had on any given individual and on society as a whole. And we work overtime to continue to improve the products, which is all that you can do. The other thing I want to ask about is the amount of autonomy that you and other product leads have. The Instagram co-founders recently announced they are leaving and WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton was critical in an interview given to Forbes. I'm a huge fan of Brian Acton and also Kevin [Systrom] and Mikey [Krieger] at Instagram. I feel very lucky to have worked with all of them as much as I did. They have all had a tremendous impact on not just their product areas but on Facebook as a whole, and on Mark's thinking and on my thinking. In the industry that we're in, people move around quite often. I actually think on average we've managed to engage founders longer than is normal for Silicon Valley at least. I feel quite lucky that we've been able to do so. At the same time, there is a tremendous vibrant culture of debate internally. And we push each other and try to advance causes that we believe in. And we do that until we identify something better to do with our time.",One of Mark Zuckerberg's longest-serving and most trusted lieutenants is making the case for Facebook to put a microphone and camera in your home.
"By Dave LeeTechnology reporter, BBC News The Syrian Electronic Army, which supports President Bashar al-Assad, added it had ""many surprises"" to come. Interviewed via email following the UK Parliament's vote against military intervention on Thursday, a spokesman told BBC News: ""It's the right thing."" He added: ""Military intervention in Syria has many consequences and will affect the whole world. ""Our main mission is to spread truth about Syria and what is really happening."" The SEA has targeted various media companies, including the BBC, CNN and the Guardian. Brian Krebs, a former Washington Post reporter, wrote that clues discovered when the SEA's own website was hacked earlier in the year pointed towards at least one member of the group being based in neighbouring country Turkey. But the SEA's spokesman dismissed these claims, saying that ""they keep publishing names so they can get attention"". ""All the media outlets that we targeted were publishing false/fabricated news about the situation in Syria,"" he told the BBC. ""Our work doesn't need funds. It just needs a computer and internet connection."" Explosion tweet Until this week's attacks, the SEA's efforts had largely focused on ""phishing"" social media accounts, tricking users into handing over log-in details. In one particularly effective attack, the Twitter account of the Associated Press was compromised, and the group posted a tweet saying US President Barack Obama had been hurt in an explosion. The New York Times attack was more damaging, however, as the hackers were able to redirect people trying to visit the newspaper to the SEA's website instead, albeit briefly. ""Our goal was to deliver our anti-war message on NY Times website - but our server couldn't last for three minutes,"" the group said. ""The Twitter attack was because of the suspension of our accounts on Twitter by its management. ""We succeeded in our attack as we expected.""

"The patch stops the flaw being exploited on some versions of Windows, Apple and Linux operating systems. In addition, it is investigating reports that another previously unknown flaw is being used in a popular cybercrime kit sold online. The kit is favoured by gangs who use malicious programs that demand a ransom after it encrypts important files. Top target Adobe's Flash player is used on many websites to show video and other multimedia content. Although the flaw was present on older versions of Flash used on different operating systems, analysis suggests that it was being most widely abused through the Internet Explorer browser on Windows machines. On these devices it was being used to get round separate security measures introduced by Microsoft that tried to stop malware working out where in a computer's memory it could find useful data. The other new flaw Adobe is investigating has appeared in the Angler exploit kit that many cyber-thieves have adopted. Security researchers said this flaw was being widely used in booby-trapped adverts to compromise vulnerable computers. Once the malware lands on a machine it then tries different tactics to help its creators cash in. It can scramble files and demand a ransom; seek out banking details or hijack ads on webpages as people browse. Adobe said it hoped to produce a patch for this other flaw next week as the latest emergency patch did not fix it. A report by networking giant Cisco said Angler was the most widely used exploit kit during 2014. It attributed its popularity to its use of a wide range of vulnerabilities found in Flash, Java, Internet Explorer and other Microsoft programs. Figures gathered by security firm Trustwave suggest that three of the top four exploits abused by cybercrime groups take advantage of flaws in Adobe's Flash, Acrobat and Reader programs.",Adobe has released an emergency patch for a flaw in its Flash software that was being widely exploited by thieves.

MtGox was a service that allowed people to convert virtual currency Bitcoin in US dollars, and vice versa. On 7 February MtGox halted transfers of the digital currency to external addresses. The firm said that thieves had been using a flaw in the system to fool the transaction process into sending double the correct number of Bitcoins. A leaked report - which Mr Karpeles has confirmed is authentic - said the huge theft had made MtGox insolvent. Supporters of Bitcoin as an alternative currency have said they are working together to ""re-establish"" trust among users and were ""committed to the future of Bitcoin"". They said they ""will be coordinating efforts over the coming days to publicly reassure customers and the general public that all funds continue to be held in a safe and secure manner"".",The head of troubled Bitcoin exchange MtGox has made his first statement since the service went offline.
"The Love Island star has been reprimanded for running an £8,000 online prize draw that failed to follow the rules for such competitions. The watchdog said she had been unable to provide evidence the winners had been randomly and fairly picked. One lawyer said it suggests the authority is now pursuing a wider range of cases against influencers. Until recently, its focus has been on those who simply failed to flag paid-for posts as being ads. Ms Hague previously had a complaint upheld against her for failing to make clear one of her posts was an advert for an online clothing retailer. Fake tans The 21-year-old rose to prominence after appearing on ITV's dating reality show Love Island in 2019, when she was one of the runners-up. She has more than five million followers on Instagram, and close to 1.5 million on YouTube. Last September, she ran the offending giveaway. Its prizes included tanning foams, sold under her own brand. To enter users had to: The original post was liked close to 1.2 million times and attracted almost three million comments. Twelve people subsequently contacted the Advertising Standards Authority, challenging whether Ms Hague had included all the entrants in the draw to give them an equal and fair chance of winning - a relatively high number of complaints. 'Inconsistencies' Ms Hague subsequently told the authority she had been overwhelmed by the response. The ASA said she claimed a member of her management team had manually selected 100 entrants at random and assigned each a number. It said she added that another independent party had then used Google's number-picking tool to choose a winner. But the regulator noted that an Instagram Story she had published after the competition's close stated that the winner had actually been picked from a smaller shortlisted group of 25 people. ""We were concerned by the inconsistencies,"" it said, adding that in any case she had failed to provide any evidence that the narrowed-down group had been chosen randomly. ""The promotion was not administered fairly,"" it concluded. Ms Hague did not respond to a BBC request for comment. Sending a message The ruling came a month after the watchdog acted against two other tanning brands which had used influencers. In those cases it said that digital photo filters should not be applied to social media ads if they exaggerated a product's effect . One observer said the ASA was making it clear that the rules concerning influencer-led promotions went beyond labelling ads as such. ""Targeting someone like Molly-Mae sends a message to other influencers, who may have smaller followings, to remind them that they are under the same requirements as any other brand,"" Nick Breen from law firm Reed Smith told the BBC. ""So, as they do more sophisticated campaigns - beyond copying and pasting marketing from an advertiser - they need to take even more care.""",Molly-Mae Hague has fallen foul of the UK's advertising watchdog for a second time.
"VPNMentor said 179GB of data had been accessible on an unsecured cloud server run by a travel services company. The AutoClerk database had contained sensitive information about serving soldiers and civilians, it said The data had now been locked down, after the US Department of Defense had intervened, VPNMentor said. Travel costs The information exposed had included full names, birth dates, addresses, phone numbers and travel itinerary details, including details of flights to sensitive locations such as Moscow and Tel Aviv as well as arrival times at hotels and, in some cases, room numbers, VPNMentor said. Payment card numbers had been included but obscured with standard security systems. Researchers Noam Rotem and Ran Locar said they had found the exposed database, which provided an ""invaluable insight into the operations and activities of the US government and military personnel"", while carrying out a large-scale web scanning and mapping project. ""For the US government, alarm bells should be ringing,"" said Mr Rotem and Mr Locar. Data on more than 100,000 other trips, booked by civilians, had also been exposed, they said. VPNMentor said it had notified AutoClerk about the data it had found but received no response. It had also contacted the US Computer Emergency Response Team and the US Department of Defense with its findings. And soon after officials at the Pentagon had been notified, access to the database had been locked. Neither AutoClerk, which handles itinerary and booking data for several hotel chains and other travel companies, nor parent company Best Western have responded to a BBC News request for comment. The data leak is the latest in a series to hit travel companies. Choice Hotels, Intercontinental, Radisson, Chinese hotel chain Huazhu, Hyatt, Hilton, Teletext Holidays and many others have all lost data or been hit by hackers. In July, the UK's information commissioner announced an intention to fine hotel chain Marriott £99m over a 2018 data breach that saw details on 339 million guests go astray.","The travel details of large numbers of US government and military personnel have been exposed in a data leak, a security company says."
"By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter But Steve isn't an engineer at Apple or Amazon, he is a designer from Leeds and the AI he is hoping will pass the test - Mitsuku - is one you have probably never heard of. The competition he is taking part in, the Loebner Prize, is one of the only real-world Turing Tests but is also relatively obscure in the highly-hyped world of artificial intelligence - and not without controversy. This year could be the last time Steve competes - the sponsor Hugh Loebner, a millionaire inventor who made his fortune from brass fittings, died in 2016 so there is no longer funding for the prize. The competition sees four judges conducting a series of conversations with both humans and bots which they then score out of 100. 'Old ladies' Each bot is asked the same 20 questions, of varying degrees of complexity. At the same time, the same message is typed to a human, with the judge tasked with deciding which is which. Typically, winning bots only get a score of about 30 out of 100, with none ever reaching the heady heights of 70, which would - under Turing Test rules - be ""human enough"". The test was developed by mathematician Alan Turing in 1950 as a way of demonstrating a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behaviour indistinguishable from a human. His paper proposed this could be tested via a series of conversations, one with a machine and one with a human. Each judge would have five minutes to talk to each machine and if more than 30% of the judges thought they were human, the machine passed the test. Under Loebner Prize rules, the conversations are 25 minutes long and the machine only wins if it fools at least half the judges. That has never happened. Instead the prize money goes to the machine that convinces the most judges. ""It usually becomes apparent after the first few questions which is the bot,"" said Mr Worswick, who has 'won' four times. Since the Loebner Prize launched in 1991, it has had a range of partners - from the Cambridge Center for Behavioural Studies to the Science Museum and The Society for the Study of Artificial Intelligence and the Simulation of Behaviour (AISB) but it has failed to attract bigger players or those studying in the field. Noel Sharkey, computer scientist at Sheffield University and two-times judge at the event, is baffled as to why it has always been so low-key. ""I am a little surprised, given the number of chatbots we are all experiencing in online customer services, that this is not a much bigger affair,"" he said. ""It might be that the big tech companies don't like the idea of independent objective evaluation or maybe they are a bit worried about competing with one another."" There could be truth in this. In 2013 someone unofficially entered Siri, Apple's virtual assistant, into the contest and it finished in 14th place. For two years, the competition was hosted in Mr Loebner's apartment but from 2014 to 2018 it took place at Bletchley Park where Alan Turing spent his wartime years as a codebreaker. Two side rooms were set aside for the competition but with no publicity given to it, the only people who stumbled upon it would be visitors to the code-breaking museum. ""It was usually little old ladies on a day out who would much rather reminisce about the war than talk about conversational AI,"" said Mr Worswick. The lack of success of the competition among the AI community could just be a case of bad timing, thinks Prof Sharkey. ""It started out really well in 1991 when there was still great interest in the Turing Test with all the great and good of AI on the programme panel,"" he said. ""All the media turned up,"" he added, but things quickly turned sour ""when the AI systems of the day were shown to be hopeless at the task"". ""After that it was sidelined and only small companies and hobbyists have taken it up."" And Hugh Loebner himself may have put some people off, he thinks. ""Loebner's eccentric personality did not help much. He was a very provocative man, quite blunt and said some very dumb things that annoyed a lot of people. Personally I was highly amused by him. He told me that the reason why he started the competition was that he just wanted to be famous,"" said Prof Sharkey. Mr Loebner also dedicated his time to fighting for the rights of sex workers and would often turn up to the competition with ""young women on his arms,"" he added. Both the venue and the nature of the contest have changed this year, moving from Bletchley Park to Swansea University. There will no longer be a panel of judges. Instead, the chatbots will be judged by the public and there will be no human competitors. ""No-one's quite sure how it will pan out,"" said Mr Worswick. The Loebner prize may now be on the verge of fading into obscurity. ""I do not think that the Loebner prize has had a big impact on AI language processors because it has not had much take-up from the academic community and none from the big tech companies,"" said Prof Sharkey. He does, however, believe that the field, now fully revived and brimming with hype, could benefit from its own more high-profile test - one that Amazon, Google and Apple were prepared to take part in. ""Perhaps they should take a lesson from the big car manufacturers competing in Formula One. Competitions like this can push the envelope of innovation and accelerate development,"" he said.","This weekend Steve Worswick will be pushing the boundaries of what it is to be human, attempting to fool a panel of judges into thinking they are chatting to another person while really they will be talking to a chatbot."
"It says the search giant is close to agreeing to pay $22.5m (£14.5m) to settle a privacy complaint. It follows an earlier report which revealed Google had bypassed a ""do not track"" setting selected in Apple's Safari web browser. Google has indicated that its action had been an unintentional mistake. The Reuters and Associated Press news agencies both quote an unnamed source who has confirmed the report. The Wall Street Journal revealed in February that a Stanford University researcher had noticed that Google had exploited a loophole in Safari. It allowed Google's cookies to be installed via adverts on popular websites even if users' browsers' preferences had been set to reject them. This allowed the firm to track people's web-use habits even if they had not given it permission to do so. Google says no personal information was collected. 'Invisible form' Safari is the default browser on Apple's iPhones, iPads and Macintosh computers, and is also available for PCs. When installed, its preferences panel is set to reject tracking cookies by default. The paper said that Google had taken advantage of the fact that Safari allowed multiple cookies to be installed on a device as long as its user had given permission for a first cookie to be downloaded. It said the search firm's code had made Safari think the user had filled in an ""invisible form"" allowing the process to be triggered. Google had previously told users that they could rely on Safari's settings to avoid it tracking them. When the article was published the firm announced it would halt the process. It added that the do-not-track workaround was an unanticipated side-effect of its efforts to personalise its Google+ social network's accounts. Negotiated penalty A previous legal settlement with the FTC meant the agency could fine Google a maximum of $16,000 per day for each violation of its privacy practices. Bearing in mind millions of users were likely to have been affected, the sum could have been significantly larger than the settlement fee now suggested. The FTC declined to comment on the Journal's latest report. A Google spokesman said the firm could not comment on the ""specifics"" of the case, but provided an emailed statement. It said: ""We... set the highest standards of privacy and security for our users."" ""The FTC is focused on a 2009 help-centre page published more than two years before our consent decree, and a year before Apple changed its cookie-handling policy. ""We have now changed that page and taken steps to remove the ad cookies, which collected no personal information, from Apple's browsers."" Google may also face penalties from other regulators outside the US. It is also facing probes into its Street View vehicle's collection of personal data without users' permission.","Google is set to pay the largest fine ever imposed on a single company by the US Federal Trade Commission, according to the Wall Street Journal."
"Just over £7,900-worth of virtual currency has been moved from the Bitcoin address listed in the blackmail demand that appeared on hacked PCs. One expert said there was little doubt the funds had been tapped by those responsible for the crime. And it seems they have now made a fresh ransom demand. However, analysts suggest the move is intended to confuse investigations into the matter. In other related developments, Ukraine's interior minister has said the police managed to prevent a second wave of attacks by shutting down and confiscating computer servers used by a local software company, which is thought to have unwittingly helped the Petya-variant virus to spread. And after having repeatedly denied any involvement in the transmission of the malware, the developer Intellect Service has acknowledged an upgrade to its MeDoc tax software was indeed ""contaminated"", allowing the attack to be carried out. ""As of today, every computer which is on the same local network as our product is a threat,"" the company's chief executive Olesya Bilousova told reporters. She added that one million computers in Ukraine had MeDoc installed on them. The police have recommended that everyone stops using the program and turns off computers that have it. Although the majority of the detected attacks occurred within Ukraine, according to analysis by security firm Eset the malware also affected businesses across the world. Their computers became inaccessible after the code spread over their internal networks, scrambling a part of the PCs' operating systems used to locate where files are stored. High-profile casualties included Nurofen-maker Reckitt Benckiser, Oreo cookie manufacturer Mondelez International, the shipping group Maersk and the advertising agency WPP. Most of those struck did not, however, pay the ransom demand. This was in part because the email address given by the attackers to contact them was shut down by its German operator. And until Tuesday, the funds that were raised lay dormant. But at 22:32 BST on Tuesday, three transfers were triggered. Two of these were sent to Bitcoin wallets used to collect donations to the PasteBin and DeepPaste text-sharing services - platforms often used by hackers to announce their activities. The third and largest of the transfers went to an address that had previously been empty. A little later, a post appeared on DeepPaste demanding 100 bitcoins ($256,300; £198,500) for a ""private key to decrypt any hard disk"" affected by the attack. ""Unless the hackers gave away the Bitcoin account linked to the original ransom demand, only they could have moved the funds,"" Prof Alan Woodward from the University of Surrey told the BBC. ""People are gobsmacked they have gone anywhere near it - they can't be daft enough to try and cash it out. ""As far as we can tell, there's no way to actually decrypt affected PCs even if you paid the new demand. ""So, it may be that they are trying to lead a false trail away from themselves."" Ukraine has accused Russia of being involved in the attack, but the Kremlin has denied any responsibility. The news site Motherboard said it spoke to someone claiming to be one of the hackers on a dark web chatroom. The supposed criminal offered to demonstrate that they could decrypt any file scrambled by the Petya-variant. And Motherboard reports that they did indeed manage to decrypt a test file after a two hour wait. But Prof Woodward said this did not necessarily mean the key could be used to recover all the lost data. ""Once the PC's MFT [Master File Table] is corrupted the files on that disc are lost,"" he explained, referring to the fact that the virus had scrambled a critical part of the PCs' operating systems and not just individual documents. ""And as far as we can tell, there is an error in the encryption they used, so larger files can't be decrypted."" Update 6 July 2017: This article was updated to reflect the fact the hackers demonstrated their private key could decrypt files",The perpetrators of a recent cyber-attack that disrupted businesses across the world appear to have accessed the ransom payments they raised.
"By Dave LeeTechnology reporter, BBC News A row between a spam-fighting group and hosting firm has sparked retaliation attacks affecting the wider internet. Experts worry that the row could escalate to affect banking and email systems. Five national cyber-police-forces are investigating the attacks. Spamhaus, a group based in both London and Geneva, is a non-profit organisation that aims to help email providers filter out spam and other unwanted content. To do this, the group maintains a number of blocklists - a database of servers known to be being used for malicious purposes. Recently, Spamhaus blocked servers maintained by Cyberbunker, a Dutch web host that states it will host anything with the exception of child pornography or terrorism-related material. Sven Olaf Kamphuis, who claims to be a spokesman for Cyberbunker, said, in a message, that Spamhaus was abusing its position, and should not be allowed to decide ""what goes and does not go on the internet"". Spamhaus has alleged that Cyberbunker, in cooperation with ""criminal gangs"" from Eastern Europe and Russia, is behind the attack. Cyberbunker has not responded to the BBC's request for comment. 'Immense job' Steve Linford, chief executive for Spamhaus, told the BBC the scale of the attack was unprecedented. ""We've been under this cyber-attack for well over a week. ""But we're up - they haven't been able to knock us down. Our engineers are doing an immense job in keeping it up - this sort of attack would take down pretty much anything else."" Mr Linford told the BBC that the attack was being investigated by five different national cyber-police-forces around the world. He claimed he was unable to disclose more details because the forces were concerned that they too may suffer attacks on their own infrastructure. The attackers have used a tactic known as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), which floods the intended target with large amounts of traffic in an attempt to render it unreachable. In this case, Spamhaus's Domain Name System (DNS) servers were targeted - the infrastructure that joins domain names, such as bbc.co.uk, the website's numerical internet protocol address. Mr Linford said the attack's power would be strong enough to take down government internet infrastructure. ""If you aimed this at Downing Street they would be down instantly,"" he said. ""They would be completely off the internet."" He added: ""These attacks are peaking at 300 Gbps (gigabits per second). ""Normally when there are attacks against major banks, we're talking about 50 Gbps"" Clogged-up motorway The knock-on effect is hurting internet services globally, said Prof Alan Woodward, a cybersecurity expert at the University of Surrey. ""If you imagine it as a motorway, attacks try and put enough traffic on there to clog up the on and off ramps,"" he told the BBC. ""With this attack, there's so much traffic it's clogging up the motorway itself."" Arbor Networks, a firm which specialises in protecting against DDoS attacks, also said it was the biggest such attack they had seen. ""The largest DDoS attack that we have witnessed prior to this was in 2010, which was 100 Gbps. Obviously the jump from 100 to 300 is pretty massive,"" said Dan Holden, the company's director of security research. ""There's certainly possibility for some collateral damage to other services along the way, depending on what that infrastructure looks like."" Spamhaus said it was able to cope as it has highly distributed infrastructure in a number of countries. The group is supported by many of the world's largest internet companies who rely on it to filter unwanted material. Mr Linford told the BBC that several companies, such as Google, had made their resources available to help ""absorb all of this traffic"". The attacks typically happened in intermittent bursts of high activity. ""They are targeting every part of the internet infrastructure that they feel can be brought down,"" Mr Linford said. ""Spamhaus has more than 80 servers around the world. We've built the biggest DNS server around.""",The internet around the world has been slowed down in what security experts are describing as the biggest cyber-attack of its kind in history.
"By Ashley GoldBBC News, Washington When Apple released its iOS9 mobile operating system it included a new feature - the ability for women to log their sexual activity alongside details of their menstrual cycles. An earlier version of its HealthKit software - which tracks everything from electrodermal activity to chromium intake - had lacked the facility. Other apps existed that could pick up the slack, but it had led to claims that Apple - and other phone companies - had not focused closely enough on women's health. Samsung's S Health and Android's Google Fit have yet to add this feature into their health apps, but it's likely to only be a matter of time before they do. Women who are trying to get pregnant often track a number of health signals in order to fully understand their monthly cycle and therefore catch their most fertile times - much as a marathon runner would track their fitness metrics. According to Apple, users decide which information will go into the Health app and which third-party apps can access the data. Those third-party apps must have a privacy policy. When phones are locked, the health and fitness data is encrypted. If users choose to back up health data to iCloud, that is encrypted as well. ""A lot of people are monitoring data that helps them plan for a family,"" says Ricky Bloomfield, a doctor at Duke University who is currently engaged in trials for HealthKit with his patients. ""The impact here can be quite significant in giving users tools to do that more accurately."" The categories people can track include sexual activity, including whether protection was used, basal body temperature, cervical mucus quality, menstruation, ovulation test results and spotting. Dr Nathaniel DeNicola, a gynaecologist at the University of Pennsylvania, said the sex-tracking technologies had the power to help people take more charge of their health care and communicate better with their doctors. Gynaecologists take the last menstrual period as a vital sign and when women can log it in their phones, they are much more likely to have accurate dates on hand, said Mr DeNicola. ""It's almost ubiquitous now that women will have an app to track their pregnancy,"" he said. He does not always recommend patients track their reproductive health via an app, but he asks patients about it and tells them it can be useful. There are no studies proving that these apps improve the chance of getting pregnant, or cure diseases, but this kind of digital recording can enhance patient memory, he said. Often, questions asked at the gynaecologist's office can turn into a ""guessing game"". Patients used to do a diligent job with pen and paper, tracking activity when trying to get pregnant. Now it has gone digital. ""It's pretty clear if they're putting it in the phone, it'll increase recall, and help us in dating pregnancies,"" he said. Mr DeNicola notes that apps to track health are ""inherently fraught with limitations"". ""I think we always see tech as having risks...but since the evolution seems inevitable, we may as well find the positive,"" he said. Tara Culp-Ressler, a Washington, DC-based journalist who tracks reproductive health issues closely, said the tech giant's announcement was a welcome change to views on women's health in 2015. ""Regardless of whether women think it's a useless app compared to other tracking apps - it is a good step to see such a huge company, especially one that's been criticised in the past, really stepping up and making a statement that women's health and hygiene is integral part of healthcare,"" says Ms Culp-Ressler. Reproductive organs are just another part of the body one might want to track like heartbeat or sleep patterns and that message coming from Apple is an important one, Ms Culp-Ressler said. Megan King, who lives in New York City, had used Clue - one of the other reproductive health trackers - for about a year before iOS9 was released. Such apps are a good way to track menstrual cycle and fertility, she said. ""This is the year of females owning their feminine hygiene,"" she added. ""Apple integrating is a huge step forward because it's showing its support of women being aware of what's going on in their own body, and they want it to be something important to everyone.""",Would you go around telling people when you've had sex?
"Mr Houser was a main creative force behind two of the firm's biggest series, Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead. His departure comes after an ""extended break"", Rockstar's parent company Take-Two Interactive said. Rockstar's series have often courted controversy, but are among the best-selling and most critically-acclaimed games of the past two decades. Mr Houser will officially depart in March, according to a notice Take-Two sent to US financial regulators. His brother Sam Houser will remain as the company's president. Dan Houser was one of the lead writers for the Grand Theft Auto series, as well as Rockstar's other hits, Bully and Red Dead Redemption. He also worked as a voice actor on some of the company's projects. In its filing, Take-Two wrote it was ""extremely grateful"" for Mr Houser's contributions and that the remaining team was focused on upcoming projects. Grand Theft Auto V, released in 2013, was one of the most commercially successful games of the decade, selling well over 100 million copies. Rockstar's controversial success The Grand Theft Auto series, as the name suggests, is mostly about stealing cars. It puts players in the shoes of a criminal, wanting to build an empire - allowing them to engage in robbery, murder, or soliciting prostitution. The violent and sexual nature of the games has made the company a frequent target of criticism by politicians and special interest groups. But the company has also recently had to battle controversy among its fans. In 2018, while the company was creating the award-winning and hugely successful Red Dead Redemption 2, Dan Houser told Vulture that the team was working 100-hour weeks. The comment caused a stir at a time when many game journalists and fans were beginning to discuss so-called ""crunch"", where staff work to meet tight deadlines for a game's release. Even during the creation of the first Red Dead Redemption in 2010, spouses and partners of the game's developers wrote an open letter accusing Rockstar of working them ""to the brink"". Rockstar is known for taking longer than the norm to develop its games. The company did not announce Mr Houser's replacement or respond to requests for further comment. Take-Two's stock fell 5% following the announcement of Mr Houser's departure","Co-founder of Rockstar Games, Dan Houser, is leaving the firm he started with his brother Sam in 1998."
"Operators have said the move would hinder their efforts to manage traffic. The ""net neutrality"" proposal would put the EU at odds with the US, where video streaming service Netflix is paying the country's biggest cable firm for preferential treatment on its network. The law still needs to be approved by Europe's Council of Ministers. It would also prohibit mobile networks and broadband providers from blocking services - such as WhatApp messages or Google Drive storage - that compete with their own offerings. At present Slovenia and the Netherlands are the only members of the 28-nation bloc to enshrine the principle in law. Enhanced services The principle behind the proposed law is that all internet traffic should be treated equally regardless of its source. MEPs feared that unless new rules were put in place, internet providers might threaten to slow down traffic from data intensive services - such as video-on-demand and cloud storage - unless the firms behind them paid a fee. However, the mobile and cable firms have warned that the law would also prevent them from being able to offer enhanced services - for example charging a movie site a fee to ensure that their 4K ultra-high definition films played smoothly on consumers' devices when they might otherwise stutter. ""Whilst we support an open internet, a set of misconceptions about our industry, together with a rushed legislative process and a lack of technical analysis, risk transforming the Connected Continent Regulation into an anti-innovation and anti-consumer choice legislation,"" said a joint statement from four trade bodies representing cable and telecom operators. ""The current draft legislative compromise in the European Parliament reflects very restrictive views on how the internet should work and on how specialised services with enhanced quality could be offered."" Stream safeguards BT added that the UK's major ISPs currently operated under a voluntary code that promised to treat all traffic consistently, regardless of its source, which already provided ""an extremely strong safeguard for the neutrality of the internet"". However, the news is being welcomed by others. French digital rights campaign group La Quadrature du Net described the vote as being hugely important. ""The EU Parliament made clear that the internet commons should be free of corporate capture, and remain a space where freedom of communication and innovation can thrive,"" it said. The BBC also signalled the law could also prove beneficial. ""The open internet remains a key distribution platform for existing offers like BBC iPlayer and innovative new services,"" said a spokesman. ""New EU laws could help sustain these benefits and be a welcome addition to the safeguards around the successful open internet model in the UK."" Higher costs The proposal should mean subscription services - such as Netflix, Amazon Instant Video, Blinkbox and Sky Go - do not have to face raising their own charges to take account of new data speed fees from the ISPs. However, with telecom and cable companies needing to cover the cost of infrastructure upgrades to cope with increasing data demands, one market watcher warned that consumers should expect bigger bills. ""One way or another the costs will always be passed on to the end-user,"" said Chris Green, a tech analyst at the Davies Murphy Group consultancy. ""That could be through higher ISP charges: monthly broadband fees have been bottoming out for years and in many cases have been sold as loss leaders - that's likely to change off the back of this ruling."" He added that there were still ways for internet providers to charge additional fees, noting that several organisations already paid them to add special computer servers dedicated to storing their content to help save bandwidth. ""The ISPs can still charge the video providers to install data caching hardware inside their networks to enhance their services,"" Mr Green said. A spokeswoman for the European Commission said that if the net neutrality proposal cleared its remaining hurdles, it could become law by the end of the year.",The European Parliament has voted to restrict internet service providers' (ISPs) ability to charge data-hungry services for faster network access.
"The underwater drones were invented by engineers at Florida Atlantic University and are driven by rings of hydraulic tentacles. The robots can squeeze through tight holes without causing damage. One expert praised the design but warned that the man-made jellyfish might be eaten by turtles. The flexible, 20cm-wide bots are modelled on the appearance of the moon jellyfish during its larval stage. The design is intended to be less environmentally disruptive than a drone submarine, according to Prof Erik Engeberg, of Florida Atlantic University. ""Mini-submarines are rigid and typically use a propeller for locomotion,"" he said. ""The propellers can chop up the reef and the tough shell of a sub can cause damage to delicate ecosystems if there is a collision. ""The soft jellyfish robot can avoid these problems with its unorthodox design and locomotion strategy, inspired by biology."" To move, the robots use eight silicon rubber tentacles powered by pumps. Water flows into the tentacles, filling them up and then - as the pumps are switched off - it flows back into the surrounding sea again. This propels the robot jellyfish forward and produces a lifelike flapping motion. Other researchers have modelled robots after jellyfish. A team from the University of Texas at Dallas, for example, tested a hydrogen-powered bot, while engineers from Virginia Tech have experimented with a mechanical jellyfish measuring 1.7 metres. The prototypes from Florida Atlantic University are much smaller than this - only 20cm wide. They can also swim untethered, although this does mean they could drift away if the engineers aren't careful. ""It is important to track their locations so that they can be retrieved after a mission,"" said Prof Engeberg. Turtle fodder? Basing a robot on a real organism is ""a great idea"", according to Prof John Turner, a marine biologist at Bangor University. The drone's jerky movement might not be ideal for recording video or sound, but Prof Turner said it could monitor the health of the reef, for example by spotting changes in oxygen levels, or evidence of erosion. ""Of course one risk might be the drone being consumed by turtles, sea mammals and large fish,"" he told the BBC, noting that the robot could have ""a harmful effect on the unfortunate animal that swallowed it"". He said the designers should consider adding an acoustic warning device, or giving the jellyfish an ""unpalatable taste"".","A fleet of robotic jellyfish has been designed to monitor delicate ecosystems, including coral reefs."
"By Angus CrawfordBBC News The obscene material was seized during previous operations. The project, called the Child Abuse Image Database (Caid), will be launched by the Prime Minister at an internet safety event on Thursday 11 December. But one expert warned its success depended on it being properly staffed. Image Database BBC News was given exclusive access to the database while it was under development. It is intended to avoid offices duplicating each others' efforts when cataloguing identical copied images. It was created by a team of coders working in a grey, concrete office block in central Gothenburg, Sweden. They suggested the project would transform the way child abuse investigations were carried out in the UK. ""We're looking at 70, 80, up to 90% work load reduction,"" said Johann Hofmann, law enforcement liaison officer for Netclean, one of the companies involved. ""We're seeing investigations being reduced from months to days."" Two other tech firms - Hubstream and L-3 ASA - have also been involved in the effort, which is backed by a two-year, £720,000 contract. Unidentified victims Detectives in the UK often seize computers, mobile devices or USB memory sticks with hundreds of thousands of images on them. At present, they have to go through the images manually one by one to categorise their severity and start a prosecution. It can mean some material is never analysed, meaning new victims are not identified and cannot be rescued. Recently, the children's charity NSPCC said it was gravely concerned about a lack of police forensic experts. It claimed that forces were seizing hundreds of computers each year, but didn't have the staff to examine all of them. Mr Hofmann said the software would help automate more of the process. ""We want investigators to spend more time looking at the new material, instead of looking at the same images over and over again,"" he explained. ""Because we know that these images are typically traded and the same images appear in investigation after investigation."" Digital finger print To help compare the images, Caid makes use of a unique signature assigned to each one - known as a hash value - the equivalent of a ""digital fingerprint"". Detectives will be able to plug seized hard drives into the system so they can be scanned and their contents similarly encoded to see if the resulting signatures match. Other techniques, including object matching and visual similarity analysis, are also employed. The system should be able to identify known images, classify the content, and flag up those never seen before within minutes. In a demonstration seen by the BBC, a green flag was triggered by innocent images, while known images of abuse were flagged red. Caid will also be able to use GPS data from photographs to pinpoint where they were taken. ""Local investigators can spend more time being more victim centred, trying to find new victims,"" said Mr Hofmann. Detectives will also be able to upload new, unfamiliar images of child abuse to a central computer server so that colleagues elsewhere in the UK can help try and identify those involved. Tom Simmons, a former senior child protection officer who also worked at the National Crime Agency's Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (Ceop), said the initiative should lessen pressure on officers by reducing the amount of material they have to see. ""It's horrendous at times, clicking through image after image,"" he said. He says a lack of resources, the harrowing nature of the material, and the scale of the problem can cause burn out. ""There could be hundreds of thousands, even millions of images on that hard drive that the officer may have to go through,"" he said. ""You could be seeing children effectively being tortured - that does become very difficult sometimes to get those images out of your head."" 'Fizzle out' risk But some experts in the field have their doubts about Caid's potential. A similar system, called Childbase, was launched in 2003 by Ceop and the Home Office. It contained seven million images and used ground-breaking facial-recognition software. It was rolled out to police forces across the UK, but in 2011 it was switched off. Sharon Girling received an OBE for her work on the scheme. She believes it failed because of a lack of trained officers. ""We have increased numbers of offenders since 2011. How the heck are we going to get sufficient officers today?"" She fears that Caid may ""fizzle out"" unless it is properly resourced. ""Childbase ceased to exist because of a lack of resources, because there weren't sufficient officers."" ""I can only see that happening again with Caid, as much as I don't want that to happen, I fear that it may well do"".",Data taken from tens of millions of child abuse photos and videos will shortly be used as part of a new police system to aid investigations into suspected paedophiles across the UK.
"In an interview with technology website Recode, Mr Zuckerberg said that he did not believe such people should be removed from the site. They were not, he said, ""intentionally"" getting their facts wrong. The comments caused a backlash and Mr Zuckerberg later issued a clarification. The original comments, given in a wide-ranging interview with Recode, were made in response to questions about what Facebook was doing to combat fake news and sites, such as InfoWars, that promoted conspiracy theories. In Myanmar, also known as Burma, Facebook has been accused by UN investigators of facilitating violence against Rohingya Muslims by allowing anti-Muslim hate speech and fake news. The social network has now said that it will begin removing misinformation that could lead to people being physically harmed. When asked about its policy on fake news, Mr Zuckerberg offered, without prompting, the example of Holocaust deniers. ""I'm Jewish and there's a set of people who deny that the Holocaust happened,"" he told reporter Kara Swisher. ""I find it deeply offensive. But at the end of the day, I don't believe that our platform should take that down because I think there are things that different people get wrong. I don't think that they're intentionally getting it wrong. ""Everyone gets things wrong and if we were taking down people's accounts when they got a few things wrong, then that would be a hard world for giving people a voice and saying that you care about that."" The comments caused a storm of protest. Editor of anti-fascist magazine Searchlight Gerry Gable told the BBC: ""Zuckerberg could kill much of this dangerous material getting worldwide distribution - but he is a like a spoilt teenager."" ""Because of his financial powers, he just does a bit of tinkering without understanding how this material could inspire crazy people to firebomb synagogues, mosques or churches."" NBC News reporter Benjy Sarlin tweeted asking whether Mr Zuckerberg thought the debate over whether the Holocaust had happened was in ""good faith"". And Matt Ford, a reporter at The Atlantic, pointed out that Mr Zuckerberg had not even been asked about the Holocaust - ""he just said he'd keep it on Facebook on his own"". After the comments drew fire from many, Mr Zuckerberg issued a clarification. ""I enjoyed our conversation yesterday,"" he said in an email to the reporter, published on the Recode site. ""But there's one thing I want to clear up. I personally find Holocaust denial deeply offensive and I absolutely didn't intend to defend the intent of people who deny that."" Facebook has faced criticism over the way the platform can amplify false reports and has been engaged in an advertising campaign both on and offline declaring: ""Fake news is not your friend."" But it has faced questions about why it continues to allow sites such as InfoWars - which has called the Sandy Hook massacre a hoax - to remain on the platform.","Mark Zuckerberg has once again found himself at the centre of a row, after saying posts from Holocaust deniers should be allowed on Facebook."
"The company said it would introduce the new system ""to make sure it's really you"" when a user signs in. Recent attacks broke into news organisations' accounts, such as the Financial Times and the newswire service the Associated Press (AP). One tweet sent from AP's hacked account said President Obama had been injured. Some attacks have come from political organisations, notably the Syrian Electronic Army, which appears to act in support of President Assad's government. It claimed credit for hacking several news organisations, including AP. Two-step Twitter product security head Jim O'Leary said that despite the new security plans, users should start out with a strong password: ""Of course, even with this new security option turned on, it's still important for you to use a strong password and follow the rest of our advice for keeping your account secure."" Twitter said the new system would allow users to opt in to a two-step system that would require a verification code for each sign-in. Mr O'Leary said this would be simple: ""You'll need a confirmed email address and a verified phone number. After a quick test to confirm that your phone can receive messages from Twitter, you're ready to go."" A message containing a verification code would then be sent to the account holder's mobile phone that can be used to log in. Businesses which run a Twitter account managed by several people will have to find a way of sharing texts from a single mobile number to take advantage of the facility. Other security breaches suffered by Twitter included one in February, when 250,000 users had their passwords stolen in an attack. News organisations including the BBC were warned by Twitter last month to tighten security in the wake of the high-profile hacks, one of which got into the BBC's weather feed. Patent threat Twitter's announcement prompted Kim Dotcom - the founder of controversial former file sharing site Megaupload - to claim the firm's use of the safety measure infringed one of his patents. ""Google, Facebook, Twitter, Citibank, etc offer Two-Step-Authentication. Massive IP infringement by US companies,"" he tweeted. ""I never sued them. I believe in sharing knowledge & ideas for the good of society. But I might sue them now cause of what the US did to me."" The US authorities are currently trying to extradite Mr Dotcom from New Zealand to face trial for charges related to online piracy carried out on Megaupload. Mr Dotcom filed for a patent describing an SMS-based two-step-authentication process in 1998, suggesting it could be used by banks, the military and government offices. It was granted by US officials in 2000, and Mr Dotcom said the innovation was also registered in 12 other countries. However, he is not the only person to have registered claims to the technology. A New Jersey-based firm called Strikeforce is currently suing Microsoft over its use of two-factor authentication tech based on a patent it filed in 2004. And another British company, SecurEnvoy, recently announced it had been granted patents for a ""business grade"" SMS-based two-factor authentication process.",Micro-blogging site Twitter says it is bringing in an optional two-step login for users to beef up security following recent high-profile breaches.
"By Kevin Rawlinson & Leo KelionBBC News Brianna Wu, who said she faced death threats after speaking out, said the sites could help change the industry's culture. A debate is raging in the sector about claims of corrupt relationships between some developers and reviewers. But it has also regularly veered into the issues of feminism and misogyny. ""Every woman I know is terrified that what happened to me will happen to them next. And this is a true campaign of terror on women in the field,"" she told BBC News. Ms Wu fled her home on Friday 10 October after graphic sexual threats were made against her. The next day, she shared screenshots of tweets from one user who had threatened to murder her and her family, and had posted her home address to prove they knew where she lived. The abuse came after she shared pictures on Twitter mocking players with sexist attitudes, who had used the Twitter hashtag GamerGate. 'Drive women out' Her latest comments coincide with Ada Lovelace Day, an annual event celebrating women's feats in technology and science. Ms Wu, head of development at games company Giant Spacekat, also said that internet services needed to do more to help police trace those who posted abuse. ""As it currently is, when crimes occur, law enforcement frequently cannot locate the people that are doing it,"" she said. ""We need to get more serious as a culture about making it possible for law enforcement to act in very serious situations like this. ""GamerGate could very seriously drive most women out of the industry. I realise that's a very strong statement and I absolutely mean it. I don't know a single woman in this field who is not asking herself if she wants to stay."" Ms Wu's experience was similar to those of games reviewer Anita Sarkeesian and developer Zoe Quinn, who were also on the receiving end of abuse. Allegations about Ms Quinn's personal relationships with journalists were presented as evidence of ""possible corruption"" in the industry. Ms Sarkeesian was hounded after releasing the latest in a series of video blogs that criticised bestselling games for propagating sexist stereotypes. In response to the treatment meted out to Ms Sarkeesian, thousands of people signed an open letter calling on the gaming industry to change. Ms Wu singled out IGN and Giant Bomb as two popular websites that she said had not drawn enough attention to the abuse aimed at women. ""They are choosing not to cover this story, or Zoe's story, or any of these stories. This has a real silencing effect,"" she told the BBC. ""These are video game sites that are tailored towards men, so the people that most need to understand the harassment and culture that's being created, the sites that speak to them are not covering this."" While Giant Bomb has not covered the debate in depth, it did report Ms Wu's story on Monday. Readers of both IGN and Giant Bomb have also discussed the wider debate on their forums. Neither of the two sites was able to comment when asked for a response. The increasingly bitter GamerGate debate, she said, mirrored the polarisation of American politics. ""It is not a secret that I am a feminist and I have more liberal views and a lot of these GamerGaters have more right-wing views,"" she said. ""What we are seeing now is this political polarisation spreading into different industries. It is certainly happening to women in tech and it is certainly happening to women in games."" 'GamerGate' Those who have used the GamerGate hashtag, which was coined by actor Adam Baldwin, have argued that their core demand was better ethical standards in gaming journalism. They have called for journalists with conflicts of interest to disclose relevant personal relationships or avoid writing altogether about the work of their friends. ""GamerGate is anything BUT a bunch of mindless misogynists trying to shut down women in gaming,"" wrote one user of the IGN website, who used the pseudonym RoboJules. ""It's never been about that. GamerGate is reformation of games media."" Others have argued that some women in the industry are not ""real gamers"", but rather ""social justice warriors"" using gaming as a proxy battlefield. But RoboJules addresses this point in a follow-up blog, saying: ""Social justice has its place, even in gaming, but it's not the only part of gaming. ""Some things exist purely for the entertainment of a particular audience, and not every game has to be socially conscious. If social justice has any place in gaming, it's to promote socially conscious game development for the future; not to scorn games and gamers for not catering to a certain agenda."" The debate, however, has regularly been punctured by bouts of abuse against those who have claimed that GamerGate had its origins in the misogynistic hounding of Ms Quinn. Several other women who have discussed the topic have also complained that they have been targeted with threats of murder and rape.","More video game news sites must place a spotlight on the misogynistic abuse that could drive women from the industry, a developer has demanded."
"A new function, the Knowledge Graph, will make the site's algorithms act ""more human"", the site said in a blog post . The feature will at first be available to US-based users, but will be rolled out globally in due course. It follows similar efforts by rival Bing to provide added search content beyond the typical list of links. Microsoft's search engine launched its ""snapshot"" column last week as part of a wider site redesign. Google's senior vice-president of engineering, Amit Singhal, explained that, until now, the search engine had been able only to match keywords, rather than understand context. Mr Singhal said the words ""Taj Mahal"" could mean different things to different people. ""You might think of one of the world's most beautiful monuments, or a Grammy Award-winning musician, or possibly even a casino in Atlantic City, NJ. Or, depending on when you last ate, the nearest Indian restaurant,"" he said. Key information Google said the Knowledge Graph has been programmed to use around 3.5 billion different attributes to organise results, meaning it could now group results according to those various alternative interpretations. For some searches, such as on prominent people, Google will automatically pull up a summary box with key information on that topic. The next step, Mr Singhal said, is to look at how the site can answer more complex questions, such as ""What are the 10 deepest lakes in Africa?"" In doing so the search engine would need to draw on multiple sources and factor in many different criteria. This kind of computational, intelligent search is currently pioneered by the likes of Wolfram Alpha - a site that gathers verified data, such as from the World Health Organization, to provide statistical results. It has long been a technological goal to produce search engines that could react entirely naturally to human-like queries. One such effort includes the search engine Ask Jeeves, where users can ask a stereotypically English butler for help.",Google has revamped its search engine in an attempt to offer instant answers to search questions.
"The Californian authorities had claimed Backpage.com's boss and two of its former owners had generated millions of dollars by hosting sex trade ads, some of which involved under-age children. Prosecutors told the judge Backpage.com had screened the ads on its site. But the judge ruled they could not be held liable for third parties' actions. ""This court finds it difficult to see any illegal behaviour outside of the reliance upon the content of speech created by others,"" said Judge Michael Bowman. His decision was based on 1996's Communications Decency Act, which says publishers should not be held responsible for content created solely by their users. The case against Backpage.com had alleged that it should not qualify for protection because it ""helps pimps and traffickers develop the ads they post"". The site had previously stated it used both an automated system searching for key words and human review to check the contents of every post to its adult section. But the judge said he needed further evidence that the site was actually involved in the notices' creation. Charges of pimping a minor, pimping and conspiracy to commit pimping have now been dropped against the site's chief executive, Carl Ferrer, while charges of conspiracy to commit pimping have also been dropped against its ex-owners Michael Lacey and James Larkin. A spokesman for the business described the attempted prosecution of the men as an ""abuse of power"". But California's attorney general, Kamala Harris, who will shortly become a senator for the Democrat Party, said she intended to find other means to hold the men to account. ""We will not turn a blind eye to the defendants' exploitative behaviour simply because they conducted their criminal enterprise online rather than on a street corner,"" she said.","Accusations the operators of a website likened to being an ""online brothel"" had engaged in pimping have been dismissed by a judge."
"It is the only machine known to have been personally sold by Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, from a garage in California in 1976. Fewer than 50 Apple 1 computers are now believed to be in existence. Yet despite its rarity, the machine was sold at way below auction house Christie's estimate of $400,000-$600,000. In October, the Henry Ford organization paid $905,000 for one of the computers. The original Apple Computer - now referred to as the Apple 1 - was hand-made by Steve Wozniak, an engineer who co-founded Apple, with Jobs, in the 1970s. When new, the machines sold for $666.66. To finance the building of the machines, Jobs sold his VW van, while Wozniak sold a calculator for $500.","A fully operational Apple 1 computer has been sold at auction for $365,000 (£230,000)."
"Andrew Crossley, the solicitor at the heart of the controversy, was absent from court but could still face heavy fines. Judge Birss is considering whether ACS Law should pay the defendants' costs. Ralli, the law firm which represents five of the accused, is seeking £90,000. It is unusual for a judge to impose so-called wasted costs and only happens when legal representatives are considered to have acted improperly. ACS Law was heavily criticised by Judge Birss in an earlier judgement on the case. The normal procedures for apportioning costs may not apply, he warned at Wednesday's hearing. ""If ever there was a case with conduct out of the norm it was this one,"" he said. Speculative invoicing Mr Crossley has faced a barrage of media scrutiny since he began sending letters to alleged file-sharers in June 2009. At least 10,000 people are believed to have been contacted by his law firm. Consumer watchdog Which? highlighted several cases where people claimed to have been wrongly accused. Critics increasingly accused Mr Crossley of pursuing a letter-writing campaign against alleged net pirates as a way of making money - so-called speculative invoicing - with no intention of ever bringing them to court. People receiving letters were offered the chance to pay a fine of around £500 per infringement. This view was given validity when Mr Crossley brought 27 cases to court but sought to discontinue them at the last minute. A frustrated Judge Birss refused to allow the cases to be dropped and instead put the methods of ACS Law under the spotlight. He accused the firm of seeking ""to avoid judicial scrutiny"". At a hearing in January, Mr Crossley dramatically withdrew from the cases, saying he no longer wanted to pursue illegal file-sharers because of the ""immense hassle"" it was causing him and his family. Bleak House His barrister Paul Parker argued in Wednesday's court hearing that he should not be liable for costs. He said that Mr Crossley's file-sharing case load had operated at a loss, with Mr Crossley claiming to have spent £750,000 on pursuing net pirates while making £300,000 from people paying fines. Guy Tritton, barrister for Ralli, countered that the way ACS Law had conducted the cases amounted to ""an abuse of process"" and drew parallels with Charles Dickens's famous courtroom drama Bleak House. ""Dickens's view that the one great business of British law is to make money for itself is apposite in this case. The primary purpose of the letters was to make money for ACS Law,"" he said. As well as proving to be a fascinating courtroom drama, the case has wider implications as governments around the world grapple with how to deal with the issue of copyright infringement. The cases have brought into question whether an IP address - the numerical code which identifies the network connection a person is using - can be used as evidence in court. The UK's Digital Economy Act, set up in part to deal with illegal downloading, is facing its own judicial review next week, with ISPs BT and TalkTalk claiming that the measures introduced to chase illegal file-sharers ""simply won't work"". A group of MPs will hear evidence next week as it takes its own look at the Act. Meanwhile Mr Crossley is under investigation by the Solicitors Regulation Authority. The Information Commissioner is also considering whether ACS Law should be fined for a data breach, which saw the details of the people who had received letters and the pornographic films they are accused of downloading exposed online. Law firm Ralli is considering pursuing a group action for harassment against ACS Law.",Controversial law firm ACS Law returned to court on Wednesday as the cases it brought against alleged file-sharers were officially closed.

"Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent@BBCRoryCJon Twitter But the American and Chinese giants each face leadership and regulatory challenges, with Amazon's Jeff Bezos stepping aside as chief executive and Alibaba's Jack Ma under scrutiny from the Chinese authorities. On this week's Tech Tent podcast, we compare the two companies and explore where they head next. What is clear is that both Amazon and Alibaba have received a huge boost to their finances during the pandemic, with millions more people shopping from home during lockdowns. Amazon's revenues soared in the last quarter covering the holiday season, up 44% on 2019 to $126bn (£92bn). Meanwhile Alibaba had a 37% increase in its sales to $34 billion (£25bn). Each company also reported surging sales and profits for their cloud-computing divisions. Amazon Web Services (AWS) accounted for more than 60% of the company's entire operating profit for 2020. Meanwhile, 11 years after it was started, Alibaba's cloud business made its first profit, with revenues up 50% on the previous year. But both businesses' results were overshadowed by news about their founders. For Amazon, it was the moment Jeff Bezos chose to announce he was stepping aside from the day-to-day running of the company he started in 1994. While the announcement was unexpected, the fact that AWS boss Andy Jassy is taking over appeared to impress the markets and Amazon's shares barely moved. By contrast, Alibaba's investors have plenty to worry about. The Chinese authorities seem determined to toughen up regulation of one of the country's biggest tech champions. And while founder Jack Ma stepped back from running the business a while back, he remains at the heart of the controversies about its power and influence. A speech he made last year about a lack of innovation in Chinese banking seemed to anger the government. It may have been behind Ma's disappearance from public view for a few months and the regulator's move to halt the IPO of Ant Group, his fintech business, which is partly owned by Alibaba. The BBC's Asia business correspondent, Karishma Vaswani, tells us that Jack Ma remains the superstar visionary driving the future of the company. ""He is a larger-than-life character. He represents innovation in China. He is typically seen on the global stage talking about how he went from rags to riches. He's somebody people really connect with,"" she explains. But she says that prominence may explain his problems with the authorities. ""He became bigger than the Chinese state itself,"" she says. Jeff Bezos had a few similar problems with the US government, with his ownership of the Washington Post making him a target for President Trump, who referred to him as ""Jeff Bozo"" in one tweet. Under the Biden administration the personal animosity is gone but issues such as working conditions at Amazon and its market power will continue to draw criticism from American politicians and regulators. Still, it's Google and Facebook that appear to be a bigger target for regulation. Overall, it's China's Alibaba that appears to have more to fear from its government than the US's Amazon. Both Jack Ma and Jeff Bezos will continue to play roles in the companies they founded. But Amazon's founder may have a more relaxing time, enjoying his huge fortune and his space and climate-change ventures without worrying too much about offending his government.","Amazon and Alibaba, the two biggest players in online retail, have both unveiled stellar results."
"Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News@gordoncoreraon Twitter President Trump had previously suggested China might have been behind the hack, although other members of his administration had pointed the finger at Moscow. In a joint statement, the intelligence bodies say they currently believe fewer than 10 US government agencies saw their data compromised, although other organisations outside of government were also affected. They say work is still going on to understand the scope of the incident, which appears to have been aimed at gathering intelligence and which they say is ""ongoing"" a month after details first emerged. The update on the investigation came in a statement from a task force called the Cyber Unified Coordination Group which was set up to deal with the incident. It comprises intelligence and law enforcement agencies including the FBI and NSA. The group said it was still working to understand the scope of what had taken place. Eighteen thousand customers who used Orion product from the company Solar Winds were exposed but US intelligence says it believes a much smaller number saw follow-on activity from the hackers in which they stole data. The US Treasury was among those which previously acknowledged being targeted. ""This is a serious compromise that will require a sustained and dedicated effort to remediate,"" the statement said. Many organisations are having to scour their systems for signs that they may have been compromised. The incident sent shockwaves across the US partly because the breach was undiscovered for many months and was potentially far-reaching in terms of who it might have affected. It also suggested a degree of sophistication and stealth which was widely seen as a trademark of hackers from the SVR, Russia's foreign intelligence agency. Soon after the incident was revealed, President Trump raised the possibility that China might be responsible, but members of his own administration including the secretary of state and attorney general pointed the finger at Moscow. The latest statement shows the assessment of US intelligence agencies is that Russia was behind it, although it does not go so far as accusing the Russian state itself, saying only that the actor was ""likely Russian in origin"". Moscow has denied playing any part. President-elect Joe Biden has previously said it was important to take ""meaningful steps"" to hold those responsible to account. It is not yet clear, though, what that might involve. While some US politicians suggested the breach might even be compared to an ""act of war"", most cyber-experts disputed this and the US intelligence community has now played down suggestions that it could have had destructive impact. ""At this time, we believe this was, and continues to be, an intelligence-gathering effort,"" the latest statement says. This is significant since it suggests no evidence has been found that this was preparatory activity for a more destructive cyber-attack which might switch off systems. This may limit the US response since espionage operations do not breach the cyber norms the US itself promotes (largely because it too carries out such intelligence-gathering operations against other nations). In December UK officials say they believed a small number of UK organisations were affected but said they did not believe they were in the public sector.","US intelligence agencies have said they believe Russia was behind the ""serious"" cyber compromise revealed in December."
"Since the augmented-reality app launched in July, Pokemon Go has swept up gamers in a craze of monster-catching across the world. Just a week after its release in the US, Apple said the game had broken the App Store record for most downloads in a week. Gamers chasing down the likes of Pikachu and Snorlax have filled public spaces - such as New York's Central Park - with congregations of people wandering about with phones in hand. But now, a month since Pokemon Go's release, independent analysis suggests its popularity has plummeted. Some churn was only to be expected - the huge publicity it generated was always going to have attracted players who would briefly try it out and then set it aside. However, the drop-off occurred during a period when the app was launching across much of Asia and Latin America as well as France. How many players has Pokemon Go lost? No official figures on Pokemon Go's downloads have been made public, but according to data compiled by Axiom Capital Management, more than 10 million players have turned away since mid-July. Pokemon Go's Daily Active Users (DAUs) - an industry metric that determines how many people switch on an app each day - suggested that the game edged close to 45 million users on 17 July. By 16 August, that figure fell to just above 30 million. This would imply that Pokemon Go has lost more than 10 million daily active users in a month, which equates to nearly a quarter of its DAUs. Crucially, this is during a phase where Pokemon Go was launching across Brazil, Indonesia, the Philippines and dozens of other countries, meaning that the fall in popularity had significantly offset growth in new territories. Pokemon Go's downloads, engagement, and time spent on the app per day are all in decline too, according to Axiom's data. Nevertheless, in Apple's UK App Store charts, Pokemon Go is currently in seventh place in the ""free"" category, and still in first place on the ""top-grossing"" chart. The game is similarly popular on Google's Play store. What is the effect of the decline? Nintendo, which owns about a third of The Pokemon Company, has seen its share price fall about 3% in the wake of Axiom's report. In the context of the volatility of Nintendo's share price in the past month, that 3% drop isn't too drastic. The Kyoto-based firm's valuation surged upon Pokemon Go's release and subsequently plummeted when it warned investors that the game's popularity wouldn't make a significant change to its revenues. Axiom senior analyst Victor Anthony said the decline should curb concerns that Pokemon Go would weaken the usage of other popular smartphone apps such as Instagram, Snapchat, and Twitter. In July, independent analysis of Android app usage showed that Pokemon Go had overtaken Twitter in the US. ""The declining trends should assuage investor concerns about the impact of Pokemon Go on time spent on [other apps],"" Mr Anthony wrote. Was the drop-off inevitable? Considering the finite capacity of Android and iOS owners, as well as the extraordinary speed with which Pokemon Go caught on, a decline in popularity of some kind was almost inevitable. ""It's rare for games to explode in popularity like Pokemon Go has, but a drop in users was always expected after a big launch,"" said Craig Chapple, editor of mobile games trade publication PocketGamer.Biz. He told the BBC: ""Players do typically churn from these free-to-play games. Another recent launch, Supercell's Clash Royale, is also being hit by a decline in active and paying users, but it's still making millions of dollars every day."" However, the sheer speed with which Pokemon Go appears to be losing players should raise concerns, Mr Chapple said. ""The numbers, if accurate, do raise some questions about long-term retention in Pokemon Go - whether or not players are finding enough variety and fun in the core experience right now to stick with it."" He added: ""But it's important to note it continues to be a top-grossing game in most countries, so players are still spending and enjoying it."" Could Niantic have done more to prevent it? It's difficult to say whether Pokemon Go's decline would have been so steep had its developer Niantic not removed a core feature from the game. At the start of August, ardent players aired their grievances at Niantic after the developer reduced the functionality of the game's ""nearby"" feature. Before the game's update, players were able to look at a list of Pokemon creatures and estimate how close they were. At the same time, Niantic also cracked down on third-party websites such as Pokevision that let players see where the creatures were located. Axiom's data suggests the decline in Pokemon Go's popularity commenced mid-July - more than a week before the controversial removal of the nearby feature - but retention rates fell sharply following the update. What happens next? Niantic was, by its own admission, caught off-guard by the sheer popularity of Pokemon Go, but it has pledged to continue supporting the game with bi-weekly updates. ""Running a product like Pokemon Go at scale is challenging,"" the developer recently wrote on its blog. For now, the game has yet to be released across many parts of Asia and Africa, which could improve its usage figures once the game arrives in those territories. However, Mr Chapple believes that fewer people playing Pokemon Go in the West could diminish the game's social aspect, which in turn would make it a less attractive game for those who stick around. ""Pokemon Go is unique. At the moment it relies on people in your local area playing with you, not someone on the other side of the world. If the numbers continued to drop so dramatically, who will be left to play you in your small, local town?""",It is quite possibly the biggest gaming phenomenon of the smartphone age - but is Pokemon Go's popularity dwindling?
"In 2019, the company launched a trade-up scheme that offered existing owners 30% off the cost of a new speaker. But owners had to activate ""Recycle Mode"" on their existing Sonos speaker, making it permanently unusable - even if there was nothing wrong with it. Sonos said it had now removed the requirement from its scheme. Activating Recycle Mode starts an irreversible process that wipes personal data from the device - but also stops the internet-connected speaker working. The company was criticised for encouraging people to disable speakers that had nothing wrong with them. Sonos said the policy was to ""encourage responsible disposal of older devices"". But critics said it would be much more environmentally friendly to let people sell their old speakers or donate them to family, friends or charity shops. ""The concept of trading in old Sonos speakers is brilliant, but just bricking it and asking you to send to a recycling centre doesn't make any sense,"" said Stuart Miles, founder of technology news website Pocket-lint. The process of ruining gadgets and making them inoperable is known as ""bricking"", because it makes the device about as useful as a brick in technology terms. Sonos said people could now apply for the upgrade discount just by registering the serial number of their existing speaker. ""We also respect the customer's right to decide for themselves when a product has reached the end of its useful life. So, while we are fully committed to supporting customers that wish to recycle their old hardware, we removed the Recycle Mode requirement from the program,"" the company said in a statement. ""Customers still receive a 30% discount on new Sonos products, but they can now choose what to do with their old device - continue to use it, give it to a friend, donate it to charity, responsibly recycle it at their local e-waste facility or send it back to Sonos via a prepaid shipping label."" Last year, the company also faced criticism after announcing it would no longer release software updates for some of its older speakers. The change affected four models sold between 2006 and 2015. It said it had to make the change because older hardware would not be able to support the new software.","Sonos will no longer make people ""brick"" - or permanently deactivate - their smart speakers in order to take advantage of a discount upgrade offer."
"UK regulator Ofcom has issued rules that would require the firm to repair faults within two working days. Customers waiting for a new line to be installed must receive an appointment within 12 working days. It comes as BT appoints 1,600 new engineers. BT said the new jobs at Openreach were part of a drive to ""improve customer service"". It said it ""welcomes the conclusion of this review"". Under the new rules, BT must complete around 80% of fault repairs within one to two working days of being notified and provide an appointment for around 80% of new line installations within 12 working days. The target will be gradually introduced over three years, Ofcom said. BT must also publish figures on how its engineers are performing and Ofcom could impose fines if it does not deliver on the new timescales given for repairs and installations. Elderly and vulnerable Last year the BBC's Watchdog programme reported that hundreds of people are kept waiting weeks and even months for repairs for line faults. According to internet service provider TalkTalk a third of faults reported by its customers are not repaired on time. ""Fault repair has not been good enough and we have lots of customer complaints. Elderly and vulnerable people are waiting far too long,"" a spokeswoman said. She said that the ISP welcomed the ruling that it had ""long campaigned for"". Ofcom told the BBC that the ruling had come as a result of ""industry expressing concerns about Openreach's performance"". ""The problem was at its worst in 2012. With the exceptionally wet weather, Openreach's performance was at its poorest,"" said a spokesman. ""Ofcom's proposed new rules over repairs and installations will be met with relief by every household who has ever been left for days, or even weeks, without a working broadband connection,"" said Dominic Baliszewski, telecoms expert at Broadbandchoices. ""Openreach controls a significant proportion of the UK's broadband infrastructure but has no direct customer relationship, which meant some people were, in effect, stuck in digital limbo if they encountered a service problem their provider was unable to fix."" Sebastien Lahtinen from broadband news site Thinkbroadband added that the ruling could also throw the spotlight on to ISPs. ""Shorter repair times from Openreach may also act to highlight the variations in performance of the retail providers as the clock only starts ticking at the point Openreach are notified of a fault, and sometimes there can be delays with retail providers passing reports to Openreach."" Ofcom's recommendations will now be subject to scrutiny by the European Commission and a final ruling is expected in June.","Openreach, the BT business that deals with the UK's phone and broadband network has been ordered to work harder on repairing faults and installing net access."
"The global repertoire database will detail which publisher or song writer owns which rights. That will enable the rights owners to get paid each time their song is played online or via mobile services. The music-industry backed database could be up and running within two years. The new system - known as the global repertoire database - will include details on who has worked on creating a song along with who has licensing rights. It is being built by global consultancy Deloitte, which will work with publishers such as EMI Music Publishing and online music stores such as iTunes and Amazon. It will make it easier for new music services to get started by ensuring that artists' work can be easily licensed for the internet, mobiles and streaming services such as Spotify, said Neil Gaffney, executive vice president at EMI Music Publishing UK, which is backing the scheme. That's needed to make sure that all those that created a track get the royalties due to them, said Mr Gaffney. ""One of the complexities for new services is people say they didn't know who to pay,"" he added. ""It gets rid of one of the fundamental issues and means we can turn our attention to those people who use music illegally."" A similar scheme is being considered for the recorded music business. The thorny issue of music publishing rights makes it much harder for new music services to establish themselves in the UK. This led Prime Minister David Cameron to promise last year that Britain's intellectual property laws would be reviewed ""to make them fit for the internet age"".",Music publishers are building a song rights database which will make it easier to launch online music services - and fight piracy.
"By Joe Tidy & David MolloyTechnology reporters However, Twitter says only a ""small subset"" of those 130 accounts had control seized by the attacker. The security breach saw accounts including those of Barack Obama, Elon Musk, Kanye West and Bill Gates tweet a Bitcoin scam to millions of followers. Twitter said it was still trying to work out if private data - which could include direct messages - was stolen. ""We're working with impacted account-owners and will continue to do so over the next several days,"" the company said, through its official support account. ""We are continuing to assess whether non-public data related to these accounts was compromised,"" it added. The FBI is now investigating. What happened? On 15 July, a number of Bitcoin-related accounts began tweeting what appeared to be a simple Bitcoin scam, promising to ""give back"" to the community by doubling any Bitcoin sent to their address. Then, the apparent scam spread to mainstream celebrity accounts such as Kim Kardashian West and former vice-president Joe Biden, and those of corporations Apple and Uber. Twitter scrambled to contain the unprecedented attack, temporarily preventing all verified users - those with a blue tick on their accounts - from tweeting. Attackers were able to bypass account security because they had somehow gained access to Twitter's own internal administration tools. However, US President Donald Trump, one of the most prominent Twitter users, was unaffected. There has been speculation for some time that President Trump has extra protections in place after his account was deactivated by an employee on their last day of work in 2017. The New York Times confirmed that was how Mr Trump's account escaped the attack, citing an anonymous White House official and a separate Twitter employee. Despite the fact that the scam was obvious to some, the attackers received hundreds of transfers, worth more than $100,000 (£80,000). What do we know about the attackers? Bitcoin is extremely hard to trace and the three separate crypto-currency wallets that the cyber-criminals used have already been emptied. The digital money is likely to be split into smaller amounts and run through so-called ""mixer"" or ""tumbler"" services to make it even harder to trace back to the attackers. Clues about those responsible are surfacing through bragging on social media - including on Twitter itself. Earlier this week, researchers at cyber-crime intelligence firm Hudson Rock spotted an advert on a hacker forum claiming to be able to steal any Twitter account by changing the email address to which it is linked. The seller also posted a screenshot of the panel usually reserved for high-level Twitter employees. It appeared to allow full control of adding an email to an account or ""detaching"" existing ones. This means that the attackers had access to the back end of Twitter at least 36-48 hours before the Bitcoin scams began appearing on Wednesday evening. The researchers have also linked at least one Twitter account to the hack, which has now been suspended. The concern is that this hack might not be over if the attackers copied - and still possess the private Direct Messages of the accounts over which they took control. ""Bitcoin scam is a misguided way to frame this incident,"" Roi Carthy, CEO of Hudson Rock said. ""If anything, the 'scam' part supports the conclusion that the group behind the attack was, to Twitter's luck, unsophisticated. The incident can either be characterised as an account take-over campaign for sale on the Darkweb, or a data breach to get a hold of Direct Messages for malicious purposes."" Do the hackers have DMs? Twitter says it is still looking into ""what other malicious activity they may have conducted or information they may have accessed"". The private messages of Kanye West, Kim Kardashian West and Elon Musk could be worth money on dark web forums. Selling the private messages of presidential hopeful Joe Biden or former mayor of New York Michael Bloomberg could also have political consequences. However, the BBC has spoken to one hacker who specialises in social media account takeovers and has been part of a hacking group with one account suspected of involvement. ""Honestly, I think the hack is over because I feel this may have been a quick money grab and run situation,"" he said. ""If they do have the DMs, they will be extremely careful with who they sell them to, if they do, because it increases their chances of being caught by quite a bit.""",Twitter says 130 accounts were targeted in a major cyber-attack of celebrity accounts two days ago.
"The firm behind the films - Ben Dover Productions - had originally applied to the High Court to pursue 9,000 cases on behalf of a range of copyright owners. The judge threw out all claims apart from those relating to Ben Dover and watered down the wording of letters. Parent company Golden Eye did not rule out the possibility that it would be pursuing other ISPs in the future. To date, it has only requested a court order to pursue alleged copyright infringers on O2's network but this may be extended to other ISPs. ""Golden Eye (Int) Ltd continues to monitor all ISPs for our titles and pursue online and physical forms of piracy of our content,"" managing director Julian Becker told the BBC. Letters seeking recompense for alleged copyright offences will start going out to 2,845 O2 customers in August. The Citizens Advice Bureau has agreed to help those who feel they have been wrongly accused. Final letter The judge who granted permission for the case to go ahead has put strict limitations on how letters are worded to avoid the ""pay up or else"" style letters sent by law firm ACS Law. Golden Eye will not be able to demand a one-off £700 fine as it had originally wished, instead money owed will be determined on a case-by-case basis. The letters also make people aware of the help available to them from Citizens Advice, with links to the website and telephone numbers. And perhaps most crucially the letters cannot hold the bill payer liable if someone else used their internet connection to download illegal material. The final letter, a copy of which has been obtained by the BBC, reads: ""In the event that you were not responsible for the infringing acts outlined above, for example, another member of your household was the user of the computer, you should make full disclosure to us of the other parties at your residence using your internet connection."" It is not clear how the bill holder should respond if they think that material was downloaded by someone illegally accessing an unsecured home wi-fi connection. Citizens' rights group Consumer Focus, which has followed the case closely, is pleased by the concessions. 'No option' ""We do not condone copyright infringement, but innocent people should not feel bullied into settling claims and they must be made aware of where to go for help,"" said Mike O'Connor, chief executive of Consumer Focus. ""That is why we are working with the Citizens Advice service to provide clear advice to consumers about what to do if they are accused of copyright infringement,"" he added. The group has also written to the UK's major ISPs asking that they make sure that any application to hand over consumers' personal data is supported by appropriate and consistent evidence of possible wrongdoing. O2 is believed to be in the process of handing over names and addresses to Golden Eye. It told the BBC: ""We have no option but to comply with this court order and will be co-operating fully.""","More than 2,000 O2 customers will receive letters accusing them of illegally downloading porn films."
"By Chris BaraniukTechnology reporter The capabilities of the firm's Project Alloy headset, currently in development, were demoed at the CES tech show in Las Vegas. Chief executive Brian Krzanich said Intel planned to license the technology to manufacturers by the end of 2017. But one analyst said VR remained a difficult market to target. The headset does not require a separate PC or a connection to a power source - both computer and battery are built in, noted Mr Krzanich as he introduced the latest prototype. Two players in a mock living room demonstrated on stage how the headset could create a virtual replica of the room featuring scanned obstacles such as furniture. Intel calls this ""merged reality"". In the demo, the bookcases and coffee table were then replaced, digitally, by similar-sized scenery more suited to the game - a futuristic spaceship. Project Alloy was first unveiled in August last year, but this was its most advanced demo yet. ""It was certainly interesting,"" said tech analyst Brian Blau at Gartner, who also praised the freedom offered by an ""all-in-one"" headset without a cable. However, he said it would have been even more impressive had the living room been scanned by the headset itself. ""They did say [the room] was pre-scanned, so I was a little bit disappointed by that."" Market share The device will not be manufactured by Intel, but instead it will offer the technology to other tech firms to build products around. Intel hopes this process will begin in the final quarter of 2017. But the project's success may rely on others being willing to make content for it. ""They can enable all kinds of stuff but if it is not for the rest of those pieces they'll just have the parts out there,"" said Mr Blau. The firm also showed off a variety of other uses for a wide range of VR headsets - including high definition 360-degree video captured at a waterfall in Vietnam. Mr Blau said the use of volumetric video - which lets viewers peer around objects as though they were really present in the captured scene - was impressive. ""It is something we won't really see en masse for a long time because of its heavy data requirements,"" Mr Blau added. Other chip makers besides Intel have been developing virtual reality headset technology. Nvidia, for example, has been working on software and processors to power computing-intensive experiences. AMD is developing its Sulon Q headset, which - like Project Alloy - incorporates a computer and battery onboard, meaning no need for tethers or cables. There is some optimism around the potential for growth within the virtual reality market at CES. US unit sales of VR headsets are predicted to reach 2.5 million in 2017, according to a presentation at the trade show by the Consumer Technology Association. But during Intel's event, Mr Krzanich acknowledged that many were still unsure if the technology would become truly popular. ""A lot of people are questioning is virtual reality going to take off, is it going to go anywhere?"" he acknowledged .

"The US company has suggested that owners may have to re-oil furniture if the HomePod is moved. The device went on sale last week after having been delayed from its original 2017 release date. Apple updated its help page to suggest ""placing your HomePod on a different surface"" if customers were concerned. ""It is not unusual for any speaker with a vibration-dampening silicone base to leave mild marks when placed on some wooden surfaces,"" the company said. ""The marks can be caused by oils diffusing between the silicone base and the table surface, and will often go away after several days when the speaker is removed from the wooden surface. ""If not, wiping the surface gently with a soft damp or dry cloth may remove the marks. If marks persist, clean the surface with the furniture manufacturer's recommended cleaning process."" Re-oiling Gadget review site Pocket-Lint told the BBC it had never seen anything like this problem. The website's founder, Stuart Miles, told the BBC that a speaker left a mark on his kitchen worktop within 20 minutes. ""To clear it, I had to sand the wood down and then re-oil it,"" Mr Miles said. ""It wasn't the end of the world for us. But if you've bought an expensive Scandinavian sideboard or some beautiful piece of wooden furniture and then got a mark on it from the speaker, you can imagine the horror,"" he added. The problem has also been experienced by a New York Times review and the 9to5Mac news site as well as by at least one member of the public. The NYT's Wirecutter site said Apple told it that ""the marks can improve over several days after the speaker is removed from the wood surface."" Apple added that if the marks did not improve then customers could ""try cleaning the surface with the manufacturer's suggested oiling method"". It is not yet clear if the problem affects all HomePod speakers or just a sample of the initial production run. Heat and moisture? The £319 HomePod has been praised in reviews for the quality of the bass notes that it can produce. But to do so, it needs to be placed on a flat surface. ""Most others devices that I test have small feet that raise them off the counter ever so slightly to cause an air flow,"" commented Mr Miles. ""But the HomePod appears to need contact with the surface that it's on to resonate and create the powerful bass. ""I put it on a coaster to see if that would combat [leaving a mark] but that destroyed the bass qualities, so that's not a fix to the problem,"" he added. According to one furniture polish advice site, the most common causes of white marks on wooden furniture are heat and moisture. The BBC has asked Apple for more details about the issue. One blogger who closely follows the company was surprised by the development. ""Anyone who runs into this should be outraged,"" wrote Daring Fireball's John Gruber. ""Apple has been making products that go on shelves and tables for years... and I've never seen a report of damage to a surface. ""This seems like an issue that should have been caught during the period where HomePod was being widely tested at home by many Apple employees.""","Apple's new smart speakers can discolour wooden surfaces, leaving a white mark where they are placed, the firm has acknowledged."
"By Jane Wakefield and Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology reporters It told them to switch off the Bluetooth contact-tracing feature at its research-and-development labs and some of its manufacturing sites. GSK, which is working on a vaccine for the virus, said it had ""strict Covid protective measures at all our sites"". But some ""are distinct from the everyday situations in which most people will use the NHS Covid-19 app"". ""Our pharmaceutical laboratories and manufacturing plants are highly controlled environments and operate according to the highest Covid-19 security and protection protocols set out by the government,"" GSK said. ""Employees who have chosen to download the app should continue to use it in the normal way when they are not working in these highly controlled Covid-secure environments."" GSK said this was in line with government advice. Some staff spent time working behind plexiglass or wearing personal protective equipment (PPE). And all were told to remain 2m (6ft) apart. But the app, which has been downloaded more than 16 million times, does not register a risk contact unless two people are closer than 2m for 15 minutes or more. And in the frequently asked questions section of its guidance, the government specifically addresses the question of what to do if workplaces are deemed to be Covid-secure, saying the app is still an important tool in the fight against the virus, helping the NHS track where and how quickly it is spreading. Hull-based Rix Petroleum has also asked staff to switch off Bluetooth, which is used by the app to notify people if they come into contact with someone who tests positive for coronavirus. The company's managing director described it as a ""blunt weapon"". ""Large numbers of people who are not sick will be made to stay off - or it will be suggested that they should stay off - for 14 days,"" he told BBC News.

"Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent@BBCRoryCJon Twitter On Wednesday in New York, Nokia has a major event where it is expected to unveil its first Windows 8 device. That phone may determine whether the Finnish giant pulls out of its downwards spiral - and also whether Microsoft can ever be more than a niche player in the mobile industry. Next week in San Francisco, Apple is expected to launch its latest iPhone. As I write, the notoriously secretive company has not even confirmed that an event is taking place - but it has to put a new device out soon or sales will surely slow to a trickle because the current models will look very last year to fickle phone buyers. What will the new phone be called? If Apple's last iPad is a guide, it may just be The New iPhone. And meanwhile new Android phones from Samsung, HTC and Motorola - now in the hands of Google - will be fighting for their own headlines. So, as the battle hots up, what do the figures show about the current state of the market? I've looked at various reports from research firms like Gartner and IDC, and one message comes through loud and clear. Android and Apple have grabbed most of the smartphone market and just about every penny of profit. So, according to IDC, Android accounted for 68% of smartphone shipments in the second quarter of this year, with Apple's iOS capturing 17%. The Blackberry operating system fell below 5% - less than half of what it achieved last year - while phones running the Windows Phone 7 system had just 3.5% of the market. Gartner, meanwhile, has figures on manufacturers' market share of smartphones actually sold which show a similar story. Samsung has nearly 30%, Apple 19%, with Nokia on 7.6% - that includes some Symbian phones which won't be around for much longer. The figures also show that the Blackberry maker RIM, with 5.2%, has fallen behind Taiwan's HTC on 6.2%. It would take a brave pundit to bet against Samsung and Apple still being on top of the pile by Christmas. The question is whether the likes of Nokia, HTC and Motorola can make a big enough impression with their new devices to convince consumers that it is cool to have something different. And, with Blackberry 10 now not out until 2013, Research in Motion risks being left even further behind. I'm going to be in New York for the Nokia launch, hoping to ask the CEO Stephen Elop whether he is confident that the ailing giant of the mobile industry is at last turning the corner. Watch out for that, and for other news from the front in the smartphone wars.","Prepare for a month of mobile marketing overload. The big mobile phone players are launching new handsets in the coming days which will be crucial in deciding who'll be top dog in this lucrative business - or, in some cases, whether they survive as a major player."
"Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent@BBCRoryCJon Twitter My first day is occupied with what Israel sees as a landmark event, its first cyber-security conference, called Cybertech. This nation is a world leader in the field, with much of the expertise emanating from the armed forces where all young Israelis serve and many get a technology training. In the bus taking the international press corps to the conference where prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu will speak I get talking to the young diplomat who is our guide. He tells me that for Israeli teenagers, it's start-up entrepreneurs, not footballers, who are the rock stars. ""Every time people get together, everyone discusses their idea for an app or a new company."" The start-up culture is relatively recent, but technology giants like Intel and IBM have been here for decades. The diplomat told me that when he'd served as an officer in the Israeli Defence Force in the late 90s he'd been given a driver who was a reservist - all Israelis come back to the forces for several weeks each year. ""When we parted he gave me a card and told me he worked for Intel, and they would give me a job any time."" And those close connections between the military and the business world, particularly in relation to cyber-security are a theme in Netanyahu's speech. ""Our military requirements force us to have a disproportionate number of knowledge-based people who work in national security,"" he says, outlining one of the reasons why Israel has succeeded in technology. ""They're there for three years at least - it creates a critical mass. We take the best and the brightest, it creates a different kind of army - an army of knowledge workers."" He goes on to outline Israel's ambition to lead a global ""coalition of the willing"" to fight for better cyber-security. Already, his government has unveiled a plan to transform Beersheba in southern Israel into a global cyber-security hub, with academics from the Ben Gurion university, major corporations such as Cisco and IBM and the Israeli army's cyber-defence arm all working on a new science park. Mr Netanyahu talks of the balance between offensive and defensive cyber-security - and of course many will associate his country with the most successful example of cyber warfare to date, the Stuxnet worm, which attacked Iran's nuclear programme. At a briefing after the speech with the head of the National Cyber Bureau, I ask whether this offensive capability might make some countries wary of joining this ""coalition of the willing"" in Beersheba. Another reporter asks an interesting question about whether Israel is actually playing a double game, with the army creating cyber threats which inspire start-ups to create clever defences. Both questions are brushed off. Overall, my first impressions are of an amazing level of ambition here. As soon as I arrived I was bombarded with messages from start-up companies eager to tell their stories. At Cybertech dozens of tiny new Israeli security firms have been given free space on the exhibition floor alongside global giants like EMC and RSA - and don't be surprised if the minnows are giants soon. Which is not to say that this place has got everything sorted. The opening of the conference was pleasingly chaotic - long lines of people waiting to get through very tight security, and then the prime minister arriving on stage 45 minutes behind schedule, interrupting an IBM executive just as he was about to make a ""major announcement"". But one thing they get absolutely right. I've never been to a major technology conference yet where the wifi functioned well. And here it just didn't work at all. Maybe someone had launched a cyber-attack.","I'm in Israel for four days, visiting what's been called the ""start-up nation"" to film a piece which will be shown on BBC World in mid February. But along the way I'm going to give some random first impressions of what I've seen on my travels."
"It effectively completes the four-year-old software's transformation from a ""lightweight"" chat app, spun off from the main Facebook site, into a fully-fledged ""platform"" of its own. More than 40 new add-on apps have already been developed so far. But one expert said there was a risk Messenger would become bloated. Messenger has already proved controversial with some users of the social network, who have complained about having to switch between two apps to stay in touch with their Facebook friends. Facebook's founder Mark Zuckerberg announced the move at his firm's F8 developers conference in San Francisco. He said more than 600 million people already used Messenger at least once a month to express themselves, and that allowing other social networks and services to directly post to it would make ""conversations better"". Among the new apps unveiled are ways to post: It builds on a move to allow US-based users to send money to and from each other via Messenger, which Facebook announced last week, and the earlier inclusion of Voip (voice over internet protocol) calls and stickers. Mr Zuckerberg also revealed plans to launch an associated service called Businesses on Messenger. Using the app instead of email, the public will be able to hold conversations with companies from which they buy goods, or have other interactions with. Facebook suggested this could include receiving delivery status updates, organising the return of an order and asking follow-up questions. The company is far from the first to attempt to turn a messaging app into a wider platform. China's WeChat service has gone even further by allowing its users to book taxis, pick cinema seats and find nearby restaurants among other actions. But one expert suggested Facebook should be cautious about the rate at which it adds further facilities to Messenger. ""There's a potential risk that they are going to overload Messenger with too many functions and none of them become that important - it really depends on how extensive they get with the features that they add over time,"" said Brian Blau from the Gartner tech consultancy. ""We have seen something like that happen with Facebook's Timeline, where you have all these different people competing for your attention. ""So, Facebook won't want to over-bloat, but it could enable all kinds of interesting scenarios where you can integrate messaging with other apps and services."" ANALYSIS Richard Taylor, North America technology correspondent Right now many of the Messenger apps look fun, if a bit gimmicky. But over time these new interactions will give Facebook another source of rich information about a user's interests - and thereby the potential to attract more ad revenue. Facebook would have taken inspiration from companies like China's WeChat and Japan's Line, which have proven successful in building both content and business services atop their core messenger offerings. But Messenger for Business is an ambitious plan. It is asking users to supplant more tried-and-tested means like email. Other communications behemoths like Skype tried - unsuccessfully - to become places to reinvent communications between businesses and their customers. Will users be happy to shift their business interactions over to Facebook - a platform where, until now, they have been used to dealing primarily with friends? Other announcements made at F8 included:","Facebook has confirmed that it is opening up its Messenger service to third-party developers, allowing them to add functions of their own."
"By Richard TaylorNorth America Technology Correspondent Granted, both companies have new products, but the endless media attention and praise they attract is a reminder of how much has changed. Twenty years ago, Microsoft was tech's dominant force, Apple was on the decline and Google hadn't even been founded. Now, it is the Seattle's firm's products that often struggle to register in the public consciousness. The fact that Microsoft is increasingly focused on business customers, rather than the more closely-followed consumer market, only adds to the challenge. Microsoft's success has been closely - perhaps too closely - tied to that of the personal computer itself. It is no coincidence that as PC sales peaked around the turn of the century, so did its value. In 1999, the software giant was worth $616bn (£385bn) - the most valuable company North America had ever known. It commanded 98% of the PC market. Over the past decade, there have been several high-profile misfires - everything from the Zune MP3 music player to Windows Vista, which was shunned by both developers and PC-owners. There have also been missed opportunities - Windows Mobile had the potential to ignite the smartphone market, but was instead squeezed out of it. Today Microsoft's market cap sits at about $380bn. When you factor in tablets and other pseudo-laptops running rival operating systems, Microsoft's market share stands at around 56%. Google and Apple have forced Microsoft into being an also-ran, playing catch-up in a mobile-centric era. Or so goes the script. In fact, rumours of Microsoft's impending demise are greatly overstated. It still ranks as the world's second most valuable brand in the Forbes list (Apple takes top spot). Its legendary desktop software Windows is used by more than one billion users globally. Quite aside from its desktop and productivity software, other popular assets, which do not overtly carry the MS moniker, range from Xbox to Skype. Most significant of all, after the perceived stasis of the Steve Ballmer era, a young, fresh face is at the helm. Satya Nadella is almost the antithesis of the excitable Mr Ballmer; unassuming and erudite. And though his background is in software engineering, Mr Nadella means business - or, more specifically, a fresh direction for the business. The Indian-born 47-year-old has spent almost half his life at Redmond in various divisions, and understands the company intimately. Less than a year into the top job, he's already carving out a leaner operation; one in six staffers has recently been shown the door. And he laid out a vision: ""Mobile first, cloud first."" Only a few months in, Mr Nadella signalled a more open and adaptable Microsoft, first making Office belatedly available for iPad and then making much of its functionality free to use. The software is also being released for Android. In desktop, the upcoming Windows 10 promises to fix the damage wrought by Windows 8, appealing to both desktop users, as well as the ""corridor warrior"" tablet devotees. Of late, the new boss has outlined further plans to make money in the post-PC era: its cloud computing service Azure lets businesses rent computing storage and horsepower; while its Office 365 lets them pay for its productivity suite on a ""per user per month"" basis. Mr Nadella himself is no stranger to cloud computing - he previously ran Microsoft's division for several years. And he is able to take advantage of its pre-existing relationships with enterprise IT departments. Over dinner recently, the Microsoft boss outlined to me how he sees the cloud occupying a far more central role in the next few years. There is still a long journey ahead: annual revenues from internet-based services make up less than 5% of company revenue, generating about $4.5bn - less than Windows makes in a single quarter. But it is the success of services that will determine Microsoft's future success or failure. By his own admission, Mr Nadella acknowledges that to some degree he is benefiting from plans set out before he took over. And he is on a steep learning curve as a high-profile company leader, recently apologising for a faux pas in which he suggested women should not ask for a pay rise but instead trust ""karma"". The resulting barrage of publicity was hardly the kind he wanted. Regardless, Wall Street takes a bigger view, and is cheering his progress. Microsoft's market valuation again outstrips Google's, at some $400bn, and its share price has risen by more than 30% over the year - the highest it has been for a decade. There are still tasks for Microsoft and Mr Nadella to complete if they are to fully confound the critics. The Windows Phone mobile operating system barely registers on the radar globally, and the purchase of Nokia could add to its mobile business losses. Microsoft's third generation of Surface PCs-cum-tablets are finally winning decent reviews and doubling sales, but they are still a niche product, and doubts about the software giant's move into mobile hardware persist. But there is a renewed spring in Microsoft's step. And with a new man in charge, it is assuming a self-confidence not seen for many a year.","Skim through the technology news feeds, and it is likely that two names will dominate: Apple and Google."

"It is the latest step in an ongoing row over the code of conduct for US ISPs. Many want all traffic to be treated equally under a ""net neutrality"" principle but some ISPs want to choose which data gets priority. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has been conducting meetings with ISPs about the issue to resolve the deadlock. The need to re-think the superhighway code came about when a court decided that the FCC did not have the jurisdiction to stop ISP Comcast throttling traffic. In May, the FCC laid out a way round this restriction that would give it powers to oversee some of the things ISPs can do to net traffic. This proposal kicked off a series of meetings between the FCC, service providers and web firms to find out what form of regulation was acceptable. It prompted Google and Verizon to publish a plan that would keep restrictions on fixed line broadband but take a much lighter approach to net access via wireless where bandwidth is tight and data management issues more acute. In its latest statement, the FCC said it wanted more information about the Google/Verizon plan and asked for public comment on its ideas to exempt wireless and some other branded services. The plea for public input was criticised by lobby groups who want the row over net rules resolved. ""While the FCC continues to play the game of kick the can down the road, consumers are left unprotected,"" said Derek Turner, director of lobby group Free Press.",American net users are being asked to help decide what ISPs can do to the web traffic flowing over their networks.
"By Dave LeeTechnology reporter, BBC News, Los Angeles Publisher Bethesda made the announcement at its press conference at the Electronic Entertainment Expo, also known as the E3 games show, in Los Angeles. It also showed off a remake of iconic game Doom - out in Spring 2016 - and Dishonored 2. Both Fallout 4 and Dishonored 2 will feature playable female characters. The publisher's event kicked off the biggest week in the calendar for the video games industry. Tomorrow will see similar events from Microsoft and Sony as they lay out their plans for the Xbox and PlayStation consoles over the next year. On Tuesday, E3 will open its doors to the trade, press and around 5,000 members of the public. Lead females Bethesda was the first of the major game publishers to hold an E3 event. ""I thought it was strong,"" said Rob Crossley, UK editor of Gamespot, who was at the event. ""It was robust. I think they had a lot to show."" The company had shared a trailer for Fallout 4 earlier this month, but gameplay sequences were shown for the first time on Sunday. A companion game called Fallout Shelter, which is played on a mobile application, was also announced. In what was billed by Bethesda as a highly customisable environment, players can select a female lead character. Dishonored 2 also features a female lead character - news which was greeted with cheers in the audience at Hollywood's Dolby Theatre. ""I think it's a really strong move, and I think it deserves a lot of credit,"" said Mr Crossley. ""Over the past few years we've seen a growing understanding and acceptance that the industry needs to be more inclusive in how it welcomes women into games."" Classic comeback Also getting a first-showing at the event was a remake of iconic series Doom, the game which defined the first-person shooter genre when it was released in the early nineties. Marty Stratton, executive producer at Id Software, introduced a gameplay run-through of the new title. In a nod to the original game, weapons such as the Super Shotgun and Chainsaw were demonstrated in a highly-violent scene in keeping with the series' style. A multiplayer mode was also shown off, including Doom Snapmap, a tool for creating modifications to the game, including custom-designed maps. A special store will show off users creations for others to try out. Big player Sunday night's showcase was the first of its kind from Bethesda, who analysts say are positioning themselves as a major publisher alongside the likes of Activision, Ubisoft and EA. ""Bethesda's presser [news conference] was a heady mixture of nostalgia, core gaming and a heavy nod to the changing landscape of games consumption,"" said Piers Harding-Rolls, a games analyst at IHS. ""This was Bethesda's first ever E3 press event and underlines the company's determination to start to expand its output and grow its fan base and ongoing revenue streams."" Of particular interest, Mr Harding-Rolls said, was the firm's attempts to establish itself on smart devices - phones and tablets - with companion apps. ""These titles will play a role in engaging the fan base for both franchises across new screens and at different moments of the gaming day,"" he said. ""They will also act as vehicles to broaden the appeal of the PC and console versions of the games. ""Having a smart device strategy, even as a core gaming publisher, is now vitally important for these reasons.""

"On Twitter, a fan had asked if he was going to put the game back in the app store. ""Yes. But not soon,"" Mr Nguyen replied, later adding: ""I don't work by plan. I will release it when it is done."" Mr Nguyen removed the popular game in February, saying its popularity had ruined his ""simple life"". Ruined lives Launched in May 2013, Flappy Bird was free to download and required players to tap the screen to keep the bird in flight. Despite its simple graphics, Flappy Bird was a notoriously difficult game since many users could only keep the bird in the air for a few seconds before it hit an obstacle and fell. The game went viral after being promoted almost entirely by social media users and was reviewed on a YouTube channel by more than 22 million subscribers. It was downloaded 50 million times, and at the height of its popularity, Mr Nguyen was reportedly earning $50,000 (£30,450) a day from advertising In an interview earlier this month with Rolling Stone, Mr Nguyen said he was moved to remove the popular mobile game from the App store after users wrote to him detailing how the game had destroyed their lives. After the game was taken down, users started several passionate petitions to get the game reinstated.","Addictive mobile game Flappy Bird will return to Apple's app store, creator Dong Nguyen has confirmed - although he declined to give a specific date."

"Dave LeeNorth America technology reporter The driver of a Tesla car died in Florida in May after colliding with a lorry. Under scrutiny is Tesla's Autopilot feature, which automatically changes lanes and reacts to traffic. In a statement, Tesla said it appeared the Model S car was unable to recognise ""the white side of the tractor trailer against a brightly lit sky"" that had driven across the car's path. The company said the crash was a ""tragic loss"". The collision led to the death of Tesla driver Joshua Brown, 40. The driver of the truck, which was pulling a trailer, was unhurt. A video on YouTube, which appears to have been posted by Mr Brown, shows a dashboard camera recording of a previous incident, with the car steering to avoid a lorry in the next lane. He wrote: ""Tesla Model S autopilot saved the car autonomously from a side collision from a boom lift truck. ""Hands down the best car I have ever owned and use it to its full extent. It has done many, many amazing things, but this was one of the more interesting things caught on the dashcam."" What is a Tesla? Autonomous reputation On Thursday, Tesla stressed that cars being controlled by Autopilot had travelled 130 million safe miles to date. The company said in a statement: ""The high ride height of the trailer combined with its positioning across the road and the extremely rare circumstances of the impact caused the Model S to pass under the trailer, with the bottom of the trailer impacting the windshield of the Model S."" ""Had the Model S impacted the front or rear of the trailer, even at high speed, its advanced crash safety system would likely have prevented serious injury as it has in numerous other similar incidents."" The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) will look at whether the Autopilot function performed as expected, or was at fault. Such investigations can sometimes lead to a recall. Should that be the case, it is likely Tesla would put out an ""over-the-air"" update to its cars, rather than having to physically take the vehicles back. But the incident could be a serious blow to the reputation of autonomous technology at a time when regulators across the world are considering how to safely introduce it on public roads. Tesla's shares dropped by 3% after the government said it would investigate the crash. Beta test The Autopilot function was introduced by Tesla in October last year. In a conference call, the firm's enigmatic chief executive Elon Musk urged caution in using the technology. ""The driver cannot abdicate responsibility,"" he said. In Thursday's statement, Tesla said: ""It is important to note that Tesla disables Autopilot by default and requires explicit acknowledgement that the system is new technology and still in a public beta phase before it can be enabled. ""The system also makes frequent checks to ensure that the driver's hands remain on the wheel and provides visual and audible alerts if hands-on is not detected. ""It then gradually slows down the car until hands-on is detected again."" In its statement, the NHTSA stressed: ""The opening of the Preliminary Evaluation should not be construed as a finding that the Office of Defects Investigation believes there is either a presence or absence of a defect in the subject vehicles.""",US authorities are investigating the first death potentially caused by self-driving technology.
"The Intercept says the revelations came from US intelligence contractor turned whistleblower Edward Snowden. The Dutch company allegedly targeted - Gemalto - says it is taking the allegations ""very seriously"". It operates in 85 countries and has more than 40 manufacturing facilities. The Intercept says that ""the great Sim heist"" gave US and British surveillance agencies ""the potential to secretly monitor a large portion of the world's cellular communications, including both voice and data"". It says that among the clients of the Netherlands-based company are AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon, Sprint and ""some 450 wireless network providers around the world"". Full investigation The Intercept alleges that the hack organised by Britain's GCHQ and the US National Security Agency (NSA) began in 2010, and was organised by operatives in the ""Mobile Handset Exploitation Team"". Neither agency has commented directly on the allegations. However GCHQ reiterated that all its activities were ""carried out in accordance with a strict legal and policy framework which ensures that our activities are authorised, necessary and proportionate"". How does the hack work? Each Sim card has an individual encryption key, installed by the chip manufacturer, that secures communications between the handset in which it inserted and mobile phone masts. This means that if anyone were to snoop on conversations or text messages, they would receive garbled, unintelligible data. That is, of course, unless those carrying out the surveillance get hold of the encryption key. With that information, they can even decrypt previously intercepted communications. However, this tactic only works for phone conversations and text messages. Communications through mobile applications such as Whatsapp, iMessage and many email services have separate encryption systems. The stolen encryption allowed the agencies to decode data that passes between mobile phones and cell towers. They were able to decrypt calls, texts or emails intercepted out of the air. A Gemalto spokeswoman said the company was unable to verify whether there had indeed been a breach, and highlighted that other Sim manufacturers could also have been targeted. She added: ""We take this publication very seriously and will devote all resources necessary to fully investigate and understand the scope of such highly sophisticated techniques to try to obtain Sim card data"". Global ripples Reacting to The Intercept's revelations, Eric King, deputy director of the campaign group Privacy International, said the NSA and GCHQ had ""lost sight of what the rule of law means and how to weigh what is necessary and proportionate"". He said trust in the security of our communications systems is ""essential for our society and for businesses to operate with confidence"". And the impact of these latest revelations will have ""ripples all over the world."" Privacy International is currently engaged in legal action against GCHQ over its alleged hacking practices. Gemalto makes Sim cards for mobile phones and furnishes service providers with encryption codes to keep the data on each phone private. The Intercept claims that by first cyber-stalking employees at Gemalto and then penetrating their emails, the spy agencies were able to steal thousands of encryption keys at source. This would allow them to eavesdrop easily on phone calls and texts without seeking permission from telecoms companies or foreign governments, and without leaving a trace. The Intercept cites as its source documents leaked by Edward Snowden, the former NSA contractor who is currently living in Russia. 'Weakest link' Karsten Nohl, a security researcher who has exposed previous Sim card vulnerabilities, told the BBC the leak showed that ""it is still not terribly difficult"" to circumvent encryptions on mobile phone communications. He added that since it was Gemalto, and not the mobile providers, which sets Sim encryption codes, this makes the Dutch firm the ""weakest link of the security chain"". Other Gemalto clients, such as passport agencies, buy blank chips and set the codes themselves. ""A lot of telecom companies will be scrambling to find out what went wrong,"" said Mr Nohl. Analysis: Joe Miller, BBC technology reporter If The Intercept's report is to be believed, the most striking discovery is how easily those wanting to engage in mass surveillance can eavesdrop on our mobile communications. Gemalto, the company which was allegedly targeted, manufactures an estimated 30% of all Sim cards worldwide. And crucially, it creates the security key for each item. All security agencies needed to do was obtain (by hacking, allegedly) the list of security keys from the firm. Then, as security expert Karsten Nohl says, they could snoop on phone calls with a ""few hundred dollars worth of radio equipment in strategically important locations"". This contrasts with security procedures used, for example, for chips in passports. Many are also manufactured by Gemalto. These are delivered to the relevant authorities as a blank chip, and the Passport Office - not the company - creates the security key. Many of Edward Snowden's allegations have shone a light on complex surveillance tactics by the NSA. But perhaps this latest leak has done more to highlight how a single company is in control of millions of people's private data.","US and British intelligence agencies hacked into a major manufacturer of Sim cards in order to steal codes that facilitate eavesdropping on mobiles, a US news website says."
"A UK government telecoms infrastructure review is nearing completion amid pressure from the US for the UK to ban the Chinese telecoms giant from involvement in 5G networks. David Dyson from Three said a ban could delay its rollout by up to 18 months. Huawei has rejected claims it poses a security threat. Similar concerns about delays to the rollout of 5G technology were voiced by Vodafone earlier this month. Faster data download and upload speeds are promised with 5G, which is the next stage of mobile internet connectivity. Wider coverage and more stable connections than current 4G technology are also highlighted as benefits. Mr Dyson said that Huawei equipment was part of Three's plan for 5G. ""We've already started to deploy equipment for when we launch 5G in the second half of the year,"" he said. ""So if we had to change vendor now, we would take a big step backwards and probably cause a delay of 12 to 18 months."" Mr Dyson said Huawei was just one of its suppliers, but stressed that Three had consulted the government about security issues and was confident that the Chinese firm did not pose a threat to its customers. ""Huawei met all of the standards that the other operators met, and we felt at the end of that process that Huawei was the right choice for our customers and for our business,"" he said. Mr Dyson also warned that a ban would pose a risk to the UK's 5G ambitions. ""It is seen as an important element in terms of how the UK economy does develop over the next five to 10 years,"" he said. ""So I think any sense that there is a delay to the start of rolling out 5G will have implications for the broader economic environment in the UK,"" he added. Earlier this month, Vodafone's chief technology officer Scott Petty said the cost of banning Huawei would be vast. He said a ban would require his company to strip Huawei equipment out of its existing 4G network. ""The cost of doing that runs into the hundreds of millions and will dramatically affect our 5G business case,"" he said. ""We would have to slow down the deployment of 5G very significantly."" Several governments around the world have blocked telecoms companies from Huawei equipment in 5G networks, citing security concerns, but so far the UK has held back from any formal ban. The government infrastructure review is expected to be completed next month.","The rollout of 5G networks will be delayed if the UK government bans the use of Huawei equipment, the boss of mobile operator Three has warned."
"By Mark WardTechnology correspondent, BBC News When history came calling for John Cane, he thought it meant he was in big trouble. At the time, in 1943, Mr Cane was a 19-year-old engineer maintaining telephone exchanges for the Post Office. He had just finished a night shift at an exchange in Battersea and was asked to hang on in the morning as the regional inspector wanted a word. ""I thought, 'What have I done now?'"" says Mr Cane. Nothing, as it turned out. Well, nothing bad. His skill with a soldering iron and toolkit had got him earmarked for a very special project - one that would save countless lives and shorten the war by years. Park life Mr Cane was one of a small band of skilled telephone engineers selected to help create Colossus - the world's first electronic, digital computer. The Allies were building the machine to help unscramble the messages passing between Hitler and his generals. The inspector told Mr Cane he was off nights and should report, complete with tool bag, the next day to Dollis Hill - the Post Office's research station. ""The following morning up I went to Dollis Hill and was shown in to a room there in which were half a dozen people like me in a state of mystification,"" Mr Cane says. For the first two days, Mr Cane and his fellow engineers were put to work stripping circuitry off some old iron switching racks. ""Then came the big moment when we were shown in to an office and had a meeting chaired by the then director of Dollis Hill and he told us what we were destined for,"" says Mr Cane. ""We were to build this equipment called Colossus on these racks and that it was really the top secret project of them all, not to be ever mentioned outside to anybody. ""From then on we kept our eyes down on Colossus and when we finished the wiring on the racks the whole thing was moved to Bletchley Park and we followed it there,"" he says. ""At Bletchley we assembled the racks together, cabled it up and testing began."" The design for Colossus that Mr Cane and his colleagues were working to was drawn up by Tommy Flowers, a senior Post Office engineer who had been helping code crackers at Bletchley with their work. Perhaps unsurprisingly his design was based on equipment found in telephone exchanges and made liberal use of relays, valves and auto-selectors. Colossus was designed to tackle messages enciphered with what was known as a Lorenz machine that had, unbeknownst to the German generals who used it, a fatal flaw. Bletchley mathematician Bill Tutte discovered a pattern in the encrypted messages that, with the help of Colossus, could be used to unscramble them. It let the Allies read exactly what the Germans were planning and gave them key insights that helped defeat the Nazi war machine. Secret war Mr Cane's war was spent at Bletchley maintaining the 10 Colossus machines, known as Colossi, built to crack those messages. All Mr Cane and his 20 colleagues knew was that the machines were cracking codes. The intricacies of how was left to the mathematicians. Talking for the first time to the BBC, Mr Cane says he kept the secret of his involvement with Colossus quiet for decades. He has only spoken about his experiences now as the story of Colossus is slowly being uncovered. ""I'm glad that it has been declassified,"" he says. ""Before then you could not say a word."" And he didn't. For decades he ""kept his mouth shut"" and said nothing of what he worked on to his family. Mr Cane's testimony also sheds light on what happened to the machines after World War Two. On the orders of Churchill the plans were burned and most of them were destroyed. Most of them. Two, says Mr Cane, were moved to Eastcote, the initial home of the UK spying effort that would eventually become GCHQ. He took up the offer of a job helping re-house the two machines and kept them running, largely because they were still useful in helping British spies read messages sent by other powers. Sadly, says Mr Cane, the veil of secrecy that kept it hidden during the war was not maintained at Eastcote. ""One of the blocks we installed this marvellous top secret equipment in had a 3ft (1m) wide hole in the wall,"" says Mr Cane. ""And the children used to climb through that hole and pinch our tools."" After the usefulness of Colossus waned, Mr Cane stayed on at GCHQ, which by then had moved to its current home in Cheltenham. All he can say of that work is that his interest was taken up with ""other equipments"". But if little can be said about his later work, more is now being said about the key role he, and those other engineers, played in the Allied war effort. Despite this, he is modest about the significance of that task. ""The way I looked at it was that we'd done a job, enjoyed ourselves doing it and been quite safe,"" he says. ""No-one was dropping bombs on us or doing anything like that."" ""There's pride mixed in with that naturally, but it was also a period of technical development and interest that I wouldn't have missed for anything.""","As the code-cracking Colossus celebrates its 70th anniversary, John Cane, a former Post Office engineer who helped maintain it, reminisces for the first time about working on the pioneering machine. His testimony gives a glimpse into the early days of GCHQ's efforts to employ technology in its spying efforts."
"Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent@BBCRoryCJon Twitter In the last few days we have seen ads from new anti-Labour groups City Future, Capitalist Worker and Reignite. A group called Advance Together is urging voters to abandon the Conservatives. And the Open Rights Group says both Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn are building profiles of voters with their personal data - and says we should all be worried about that. No contact But the most intriguing new entrant to the Facebook election campaign is called 3rd Party Limited. We have been sent ads paid for by this organisation for two very different campaigns. One ad features a photo of environmental campaigner Greta Thunberg and urges people to vote for their local Green Party candidate. It was targeted at people interested in Greenpeace and Oxford University, living in Didcot in Oxfordshire. The same ad was also sent in by someone in the Cambridge constituency. The other ad is for a group called Save Brexit which wants people to vote... to save Brexit. It was very broadly targeted at people aged over 18 living in England. So what is 3rd Party Limited and what is going on here? Wired Magazine did some digging and found out that the company had been set up by Thomas Borwick, formerly chief technology officer at Vote Leave during the 2016 referendum campaign. What's more the Green Party was not at all happy about these ads. The Greens say they have not been contacted by Mr Borwick or his organisation and have no knowledge of his aims. A spokesperson told the BBC: ""Any Green Party adverts are always clearly labelled as paid for by the party as per Facebook rules. We would always encourage voters to check the source of any information they are receiving due to the large amount of disinformation currently circulating on the web."" It has been suggested that 3rd Party's aim is to cause mischief rather than support the Greens, by persuading anti-Conservative voters away from more electable Labour or Liberal Democrat candidates. If so, the two Green ads we have received seem poorly targeted. Didcot is in the Wantage constituency where the Conservative Ed Vaizey, who is standing down, had a majority of more than 17,000 over Labour in 2017. The LibDems were a distant third. Cambridge was won by Labour last time with a majority of more than 12,600 over the Liberal Democrats. We emailed 3rd Party Limited seeking information about the donors behind the ads and the strategy behind their targeting. We received a reply saying all reportable donations would be reported to the Electoral Commission: ""Green causes are very important to some of our patrons, and our objective, therefore, is to encourage voters to give the Green Party its strongest-ever showing at the ballot box."" The ads, said the email, were targeted at ""areas where our research indicates there are a high proportion of voters who care about environmental issues"". The statement expressed surprise that 3rd Party's efforts were not welcomed by the Green Party: ""If the Green Party feels that voting for their candidates is bad, you would have to ask them why they've decided to stand."" But the mystery remains. If 3rd Party and its donors were so keen to help the Greens why did they not simply hand over some money directly to the party, or at least get in touch to discuss where ads might best be targeted? I texted Thomas Borwick with that question. He replied: ""Third parties are not allowed to work with the central campaigns."" Seen any political ads? Send them to us Please get involved - if you get an election ad on Facebook or any social media platform, send a screenshot of it and the Why Am I Seeing This Ad message to election.ads@bbc.co.uk.",As the messages keep pouring in to our election ads project one thing stands out - just how many non-party groups want to get involved in this election campaign.
"Dave LeeNorth America technology reporter Well before Apple's iPhone, Blackberry kicked off the smartphone revolution and brought the office out of the office and into the tap-tap-tap grasp of workers all over the world. Ease of use and security made Blackberry handsets the choice for corporations everywhere - not to mention world leaders. But the Blackberry went pear-shaped. Unable to keep up in a market of sophisticated phones, with vast app stores and big screens, Blackberry was soon seen as a boring business phone. The firm, once known as Research in Motion, has had one glimmer of hope in recent times: Blackberry Messenger was unexpectedly popular with teenagers, but even BBM - as it was referred to - eventually lost out to Whatsapp and Snapchat as a the teen tool of choice. Blackberry sales now account for less than 1% of the global smartphone market. On Friday, Blackberry launches a new phone, which it is calling Priv by Blackberry. Why? It's a cliché to regard any new Blackberry launch these days as the ""last throw of the dice"". It's also unfair - it isn't. Blackberry is sitting on $3bn of cash, and so there's room to keep trying for a while yet. The Priv is an (other) attempt by Blackberry to hit some kind of great middle ground: A phone so secure it is trusted by company IT bosses, but pleasurable and simple enough so that normal people - ie the workers - want to use it. Here's how it hopes to woo companies: And to keep users happy: Will it work? By Blackberry's own admission, its handsets are performing terribly. So much so that current chief executive John Chen said he'd pull out of the device market if things didn't pick up soon. But the Blackberry aesthetic has attracted some fans. The unorthodox Blackberry Passport, which is square, was laughed at by many techies but impressed in the fashion community, picking up various design awards along the way. By being aligned with corporate success, Blackberry devices can be a status symbol, like a sharp suit. It says ""you must be doing something very important if you're using a Blackberry to do it"". Furthermore, as the Priv is an Android device, it means all the popular apps will be available - unlike previous Blackberrys which didn't support the likes of Uber and Instagram (although there were some attempts to emulate Android apps). As for the downsides, while the rear camera is well-specced, the front-facing camera is a less impressive at 2 megapixels. Not great for selfies, naturally, but also bad for video conferencing over Skype, among others - so perhaps a turn-off for business customers. At a cost of $700 for a sim-free handset (or £579.99 in the UK) - the new handset is in line with the iPhone and top-end Android devices. Though a more aggressively priced device might have been what made people jump ship at their next upgrade. What if it flops? According to Forbes, less than 10% of Blackberry's value is from flogging handsets, and so the company can remain pretty calm if the Priv doesn't do well because the firm's security software side will prop it up - for now. Mr Chen has said he wants to sell five million Privs in a year. That's compared with Apple which sold 48 million iPhones in its last quarter. While Blackberry is not being too ambitious compared with Apple and Samsung, five million in one year would be a big improvement. In its last quarter, Blackberry managed just 800,000 device sales. If the Priv doesn't impress consumers and business people, it could well be Blackberry's last ever handset.

Its latest results show it online video game sales totalled 5.6bn yuan (£560m; $879m) for its April to June quarter, a 53% rise on the last year. It said the share from overseas markets was ""small"" but growing quickly. ""We believe we are the leading social and web game publisher and operator in China today with over a 30% market share,"" said Tencent's president Martin Lau in a conference call with investors. He added that the firm would now ""devote more resources"" to its international operations. Gaming partnerships Tencent's latest move abroad involved buying 49% of Singapore's Level Up for the equivalent of $27m (£17.2m). The eight-year-old studio's titles - which include Perfect World and Combat Arms - have found success in Brazil and the Philippines, and it is also pursuing growth in India. The deal follows last year's acquisition of a majority stake in California-based developer Riot Games. It was reported to have paid more than $400m for the creator of online battle game League of Legends. Then in June Tencent announced it had taken a minority stake in Epic Games, developer of Gears of War and the Unreal game engine that powers many other leading titles. It has also formed tie-ups to publish other firm's content in China. It offers so-called ""casual"" titles from Cityville maker Zynga, and Plants vs Zombies creator Popcap. Germany's Crytek also decided to offer its higher-end first-person shooter Warface via Tencent in China ahead of its launch in the West. Next up is are partnerships with two other leading firms from the US and South Korea. California-based Activision is creating a new Call of Duty game made for the Chinese market. Like many of Tencent's titles it will follow a free-to-play model in which users do not have to pay for access, but will be charged to enhance their weapons and buy other perks. Seoul-headquartered NcSoft is also reversioning its popular title Blade and Soul. The fantasy role-playing game will compete against World of Warcraft - which is offered by Tencent's rival Netease on the mainland - but seeks to distinguish itself by incorporating an Asian martial arts theme. Western ambitions? Tencent is also attending this year's Gamescom trade fair in Cologne, Germany, which may present an opportunity to discuss further partnerships. But one industry watcher suggested the firm should steer away from a major push into the West for the time being. ""Focussing on emerging games markets such as Brazil and the Philippines makes sense given some initial success the firm has had there and, again, relatively high growth expectations in markets under-penetrated in terms of online games usage and spending,"" Ed Barton, from Strategy Analytics, told the BBC. ""However, I think entering some of the more lucrative markets in Western Europe or North America would prove extremely challenging given deeply entrenched competitors and the low level of audience awareness for Tencent. ""The cost of acquiring new players in these markets would be prohibitive and would require a sustained period of investment to crack."" Message in a bottle Although games account for roughly half of Tencent's revenues it offers many other services within China. Its QQ service is the country's biggest instant messaging platform. It is free to use but charges subscribers a fee for VIP services including weather forecasts and the ability to customise their profile. In addition the firm is expanding its local e-commerce services, bringing it into competition with the sector's dominant players Alibaba and Youku. And it is also pioneering new services such as Weixin. The smartphone app - which allows users to record and send voice messages to each other - also includes an unusual Message in a Bottle feature. Users can write a message, put it into a ""bottle"" and then throw it into a virtual ocean. Other members then select a bottle at random and read the note and can decide whether to respond. An international version of the app - with more limited functions - was launched under the name WeChat earlier this year.","China's biggest video games publisher, Tencent, says it plans to ramp up its expansion into overseas markets."
"By Kevin RawlinsonBBC News The auction for the ""factory sealed"" 1987 Nintendo Entertainment System game called Stadium Events is due to end on Friday. The seller claims its authenticity has been verified by a video game authority in the USA. One expert said that, while the mooted price is surprising, there is a growing market for video game nostalgia. ""You don't see games going for that sort of price, it is very unusual - it would be a fanboy's experience, someone who is very much into gaming heritage,"" said Nick Parker, an analyst and former Nintendo and Sony employee. Mr Parker, who now works for IHS Technology, said: ""In an hobby or market, there will be someone who is prepared to pay to own a piece of history."" He added that video games have recently entered a period in which their earliest versions could legitimately be considered historical. And that, he said, meant that ""as the years rolled by, it was right to assume that games would have that nostalgia attached to them"". The game, made by Bandai, was listed in 2008 as one of the 25 rarest for Nintendo by Computer and Video Games. The site reported that, although it was relatively common in the PAL region - which includes most of Europe - ""Stadium Events is one of the NES's most collectable games in America"". It added: ""Although it's a terribly average fitness game, its value is due to Bandai printing a test run of the game that was sold in Woolworths stores for a very short period before Nintendo bought the rights. ""Rumours suggest there are only 10 complete copies on the market, and even unboxed Stadium Events carts can sell for £400."" 'Rare' According to the eBay seller, who was using the moniker menaceone: ""It is well known and accepted in the gaming community that Stadium Events is the rarest licensed NES game available, thus making a sealed copy one of the most sought after and prized possessions for any video game collector"". There have been 32 bids since 5 January, starting at $5,000 and rising to nearly $100,000. Last year, another rare video game sold for more than $100,000. But there were later claims that the buyer pulled out. The description states: ""This listing is for a complete, excellent+/near mint, sealed copy of the game and one of few to ever be sent to the Video Game Authority in Roswell, Georgia for official grading, verification and authentication. ""Once the game arrived safely, the professionals at VGA gently cleaned the item, verified it, graded it and sealed it in a professional quality acrylic case where it will remain for the rest of its life."" Update 15 January 2015: Bidding has dropped to $32,252 after several offers were cancelled and the auction was restricted to pre-approved parties.","A rare video game has attracted a bid of $99,600 (£65,600) in an eBay auction."
"It is a record for the site which crowdsources cash to fund start-ups. Eric Migicovsky initially sought $10,000 over a five-week period but the total, six days in, now stands at $3.4m. It is the fifth Kickstarter project to make more than $1m. The Pebble watch reached the $1m mark in 28 hours. The firm behind the device, which has been designing smartwatches for three years, said that it was ""blown away"" by the support. The watch has an electronic paper screen and connects via Bluetooth with iPhones or Android powered devices to allow users to customise the watch face and download apps. The display stays on at all times and is backlit for night viewing. The firm says that the rechargeable battery will last a week. It can display distance and speed for runners and cyclists, control a smartphone's music, and show emails, messages and reminders. The watch will go head to head with an Android-compatible device released in April by electronic giant Sony Corp. The Sony Smartwatch costs $149.99. New engineers Mr Migicovsky said that he turned to Kickstarter after failing to raise interest among more traditional Silicon Valley investors. ""We tried to raise money, it was impossible. No-one really wants to fund hardware projects right now, except for the people that want to buy them,"" he said. He said he would use the cash injection to boost Pebble's team of six by several more engineers to develop new features for the watches. Under the Kickstarter model, a project's developer must set a deadline for reaching its funding goal. If time runs out, no money changes hands which Kickstarter says protects both parties as buyers do not pay until developers have adequate funds to develop their project. The site's first $1m project was Double Fine Adventure, a San Francisco-based video games developer. By the campaign's end it had reached a total of $3.4m from more than 87,000 supporters for its point-and-click adventure game, making it the first games firm to be bankrolled by internet-pledged cash. Pebble looks set to raise a lot more. The watch will go on sale to the general public at about $150, according to the firm, although those pledging cash will get discounts.",An electronic paper watch designed by a Canadian entrepreneur to work alongside smartphones has raised more than $3m (£1.8m; 2.2m euros) in less than a week on net funding site Kickstarter.
"As a result, it will no longer feature in the app's Discover section. The firm said it would ""not amplify voices who incite racial violence and injustice"". The decision follows Mr Trump saying that ""vicious dogs"" and ""ominous weapons"" would have been used on protesters if they had breached the White House fence. It follows Twitter's decision to hide some of the president's posts. Snapchat's parent company Snap said: ""Racial violence and injustice have no place in our society and we stand together with all who seek peace, love, equality, and justice in America."" The move is likely to feed into tensions between the White House and social media, which escalated when Twitter added fact-checking tags to some of the President's tweets last week. The president subsequently signed an executive order seeking to curb legal protections offered to the industry. Twitter later hid one of the president's tweets for breaking its rules on ""glorifying violence"". Snapchat's action will also put further pressure on Facebook. Its chief executive Mark Zuckerberg has resisted internal and external calls to intervene in regard to posts on its platform. Mr Zuckerberg has said the firm's free speech principles mean the president's posts should be left up unaltered. President Trump has more than one million followers on Snapchat, according to the Bloomberg news agency. It said the app is seen as being a ""key battleground"" by Mr Trump's re-election campaign because it offers a way to reach first-time voters. The president's account will not be suspended or deleted. However, the fact it will not feature in Discover means that his posts will only be seen by people who subscribe to or search for his account directly. Snapchat based its decision on remarks Mr Trump had posted to Twitter rather than its own platform. On Monday, Snap's chief executive Evan Speigel had sent a memo to staff in which he detailed his views on the civil unrest sparked by the killing of George Floyd. ""Every minute we are silent in the face of evil and wrongdoing we are acting in support of evildoers,"" Mr Speigel wrote. ""As for Snapchat, we simply cannot promote accounts in America that are linked to people who incite racial violence, whether they do so on or off our platform."" ""Our Discover content platform is a curated platform, where we decide what we promote,"" he added.",Snapchat says it has stopped promoting President Donald Trump's account.
"The automatic messages should have been addressed to each individual only, but had another 497 recipients listed. E.On said the messages were the result of a ""system error"" and were spotted ""within minutes"" of being sent. In support forums on E.On's website, some customers warned they may refer the firm to the UK's data watchdog. In a statement, E.On said it had ""apologised for an error which happened when an email was sent to a limited group of customers requesting meter readings"". The company said it was talking directly to customers who had raised concerns about the sharing of their details. 'Duty of care' E.On added that no account information or financial details were included in the emails. ""An internal investigation is under way, and the appropriate authorities will be notified where required,"" said the energy supplier. Tony Pepper, founder of cyber-security firm Egress Technologies, said it was not surprising that E.On customers were worried about personal email addresses being shared. ""E.On has a duty of care to protect such information from any risk of falling into the wrong hands, so it will be interesting to see what they intend to do to resolve the slip-up,"" he said. Although it was unlikely that E.On customers would suffer as a result of the breach, Egress had seen other similar blunders that had put customers and their data at risk. ""This is a simple but sometimes devastating mistake to make,"" he said.","Energy supplier E.On has apologised for an ""error"" which saw hundreds of customers' email addresses included on requests for their meter readings."
"The watchdog is investigating whether the use of personal data to target online advertising is compliant with European privacy rules. The search giant's Ad Exchange system is used by companies to target people with adverts across the internet. The Irish DPC could fine Google up to 4% of its global annual turnover. ""The purpose of the inquiry is to establish whether processing of personal data carried out at each stage of an advertising transaction is in compliance with the relevant provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR),"" Irish DPC spokesman Graham Doyle told the BBC. The search giant has responded: ""We will engage fully with the DPC's investigation and welcome the opportunity for further clarification of Europe's data protection rules for real-time bidding. Authorised buyers using our systems are subject to stringent policies and standards."" It would not be the first time that Google has been fined by a European data regulator. The company was fined 50 million euros ($55m; £44m) by the French data regulator CNIL in January, a decision that the company is appealing. CNIL said it had levied the record fine for ""lack of transparency, inadequate information and lack of valid consent regarding ads personalisation"". What is Google Ad Exchange? Google allows companies to target people with adverts on websites across the internet including news websites and blogs. When a person visits such a site, the advert they see will often be personalised based on data Google has about them. What is GDPR GDPR is a piece of EU legislation that aims to create identical data privacy laws across all EU countries. The regulation, which came into effect during 2018, compels companies to obtain active user consent to collect data among other rules. Firms must also report any data breaches to authorities within 72 hours. Why is the Irish authority taking the lead in this investigation? Under the GDPR, one national data protection authority leads inquiries before presenting a draft decision to other European data regulators. In the UK that is the Information Commissioner's Office. The decision for how the data of European citizens is managed is taken in by Google in Ireland, and not in another EU state. As well as Google, the Irish regulator also has responsibility for a range of other companies including Facebook, Apple, Microsoft and Airbnb. What could happen to Google? The Ireland Data Protection Commission can issue fines of up to 4% of a company's global turnover. They regulator could also enforce ""corrective measures"" where it instructs Google to make changes to how it works. When are findings expected? Previous investigations by the Irish DPC have reached a draft decision in about seven to eight months, though this Google investigation could take longer.",The Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) has started an inquiry into the way that Google provides advertising services across the European Union.
"The system, known as Thunderbolt, promises transfer speeds twice as fast as USB 3.0. However it won't reach its theoretical maximum because Intel has opted to use copper wires rather than fibreoptic cables. The company said it would gradually move to higher speeds over time. Apple will become the first manufacturer to use Thunderbolt, on its Macbook Pro computers. The Cupertino firm is said to have been a major driver of its development, although it remains to be seen how may other manufacturers will adopt the new standard. Light Peak Intel has been working on the technology for several years. It was first announced, under the codename Light Peak in 2009. At launch, its top speed will be limited to 10 Gigabits per second - twice as fast as USB 3.0, but still well below the theoretical maximum using optical cables. Intel claims that future versions will be able to reach 100 Gb/sec. The faster data transfer rates are likely to be welcomed by those consumers who use high-definition video, said Sarah Rottman Epps, an analyst with Forrester Research. ""This isn't an innovation that consumers have been asking for, but it's one they'll appreciate,"" she said. ""Especially when transferring video, as that's when [USB] starts to feel slow."" The system also promises to reduce the number of cables a user has connecting their computer set-up. It is able to carry multiple signal types at the same time, enabling power, display and peripherals to use a single cable. However, in the short term, users may need to invest in special adaptors to connect their older devices onto Thunderbolt sockets. Its arrival on the consumer market also raises questions about the future of other connector standards, such as USB and Firewire. Thunderbolt's most high profile supporter, Apple, is expected to gradually transition to a single connector, according to Karen Haslam, editor of Macworld UK. ""In the long run there will be no need for Apple to support these multiple formats with individual ports - existing products can run through an adaptor,"" she said. Not everyone is convinced that Thunderbolt will become the lone standard. Ian Chiu, editor of the website Everythingusb.com told BBC News that the cost of components could put off some manufacturers. ""I don't really know how Intel will make Thunderbolt appealing to all the other first-tier PC manufacturers,"" he said. ""HP, Sony, Dell, Acer, Asus make most of their money from the low-end and medium-end notebooks. ""On the other hand, Apple's Macbook Pro line-up is targeted at the prosumers, professionals and other people who aren't so price conscious,"" said Mr Chiu.",Chip manufacturer Intel has announced it is to roll out a new technology for connecting computers and peripherals.
"An international team produced a display that uses ultrasonic sound waves to alter film's properties and create either a flat or a 3D image. The bubble mixture is more complex than the one sold in stores for children, but soap is still the main ingredient. The team says the display is the world's thinnest transparent screen. ""It is common knowledge that the surface of soap bubble is a micro membrane. It allows light to pass through and displays the colour on its structure,"" the lead researcher, Yoichi Ochiai from the University of Tokyo, wrote in his blog . ""We developed an ultra-thin and flexible BRDF [bidirectional reflectance distribution function, a four-dimensional function defining how light is reflected at an opaque surface] screen using the mixture of two colloidal liquids."" Although traditional screens are opaque, the display created by Dr Ochiai and his colleagues Keisuke Toyoshima from the University of Tsukuba in Japan and Alexis Oyama from the Carnegie Mellon University in the US, varies in transparency and reflectance. Using sound The team managed to control and exploit these properties by hitting the bubble's membrane with ultrasonic sound waves, played through speakers. Sonic waves alter the texture of a projected image, making it look smooth or rough. ""Typical screens will show every image the same way, but images should have different visual properties,"" Dr Oyama told the BBC. ""For example, a butterfly's wings should be reflective and a billiard ball should be smooth, and our transparent screen can change the reflection in real time to show different textures."" To change the transparency of the projected image, the scientists modified the wave's frequency. ""Our membrane screen can be controlled using ultrasonic vibrations. Membrane can change its transparency and surface states depending on the scales of ultrasonic waves,"" wrote Dr Ochiai in his blog. ""The combination of the ultrasonic waves and ultra thin membranes makes more realistic, distinctive, and vivid imageries on screen. ""This system contributes to open up a new path for display engineering with sharp imageries, transparency, BRDF and flexibility."" If several bubble screens are put together, viewers get a 3D effect and even a holographic projection. The bubble is much harder to burst than a regular soap bubble, as the mixture contains special colloids - and objects can even pass through the film without popping it. The team said such a screen could be useful for artists to provide a realistic feel to their works, for museums - for instance, to display floating planets, and for magicians as well. Previously, there have been attempts to develop untraditional displays - a computer screen out of water and a touchscreen out of ice.",Viewers may soon be able to watch films on soap bubbles - after researchers developed a technology to project images on a screen made of soap film.
"UK-based Intercontinental Hotels Group (IHG) said all but one of the locations affected were in the US, with the other being in Puerto Rico. Guests have been warned they could have had money stolen as a consequence. One expert said there might be further hotels affected. Buckinghamshire-based IHG had previously reported in February that a dozen US hotels that it managed itself had been affected by the same attack. ""Individuals should closely monitor their payment card account statements,"" a spokeswoman told the BBC following the latest discovery. ""If there are unauthorised charges, individuals should immediately notify their bank. ""Payment card network rules generally state that cardholders are not responsible for such charges."" Other affected brands include Hotel Indigo and Candlewood Suites. Hijacked card data IHG said an investigation had detected signs the malware had been active at front-desk payment locations at the hotels between 29 September and 29 December 2016. However, it only has confirmation that the threat was definitely eradicated last month. The attack hijacked information taken from the payment cards' magnetic strips as it was being routed through the hotels' computer servers, said the hotel group. This could include the card number, expiration date and verification code. IHG does not believe other guest information was stolen. It has published a tool for visitors to check if hotels they stayed at are among those affected. The firm notes that other franchisees that had adopted an encryption-based security measure would not have been affected. But one cybersecurity expert said that the list might not be comprehensive. ""IHG has been offering its franchised properties a free examination by an outside computer forensic team,"" wrote Brian Krebs. ""But not all property owners have been anxious to take the company up on that offer. ""As a consequence, there may be more breached hotel locations yet to be added to the state look-up tool."" Other hotel chains to have been struck by payment system hacks in recent years include Hyatt, Mandarin Oriental and Trump Hotels. The US has been slower to switch to a chip-and-pin system than many other countries, which makes it more difficult to carry out such attacks.","The owner of the Holiday Inn and Crowne Plaza hotel brands has disclosed that payment card-stealing malware has struck about 1,200 of its franchisees' properties."
"The Kinects' video stream is merged before being fed into the Oculus headset, giving the impression of a solid 3D object. In this instance, the object is Mr Kreylos, who can be seen sitting in a virtual office. Low resolution and prone to glitches, the device is still an early prototype. The three Kinects - peripherals for Microsoft's Xbox - are positioned in an equilateral triangle to accurately capture the subject, whose image is then beamed into Facebook's Oculus Rift headset. Mr Kreylos is able to control the camera in such a way that he can see himself in both a first and third person perspective. Unlike an ordinary 2D camera, the Kinect is equipped with a 3D camera, which provides the missing bits of information necessary for 3D reconstruction that a regular camera does not have. Mr Kreylos, researcher at University of California, Davis, said in his blog that despite the low quality of the image, it still feels very real. ""I believe it's related to the uncanny valley principle, in that fuzzy 3D video that moves in a very lifelike fashion is more believable to the brain than high-quality avatars that don't quite move right."" The Uncanny Valley principle is a hypothesis that suggests human features that are designed to move similarly, but not exactly, like natural human beings - such as in robotics or 3D animation - can cause revulsion in observers. Mr Kreylos first started experimenting with the Kinect back in 2010 and this appears to be the first time the device has been used to create this particular effect in conjunction with the Oculus Rift.",Oliver Kreylos has combined three Kinects with an Oculus Rift to import a 3D representation of himself into virtual reality.
"By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter But already one of the recipients of the funding has been criticised. Waterford Upstart plans to provide online pre-school education to 250,000 children in the US. The Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood (CCFC) has called on TED to reconsider the award. The row coincides with the TED2019 conference - a week of presentations themed on technology, entertainment and design in Vancouver, Canada. Open letter The Upstart project started in Utah and is now in 15 other US states. It offers a daily programme of screen-based activities lasting 15 minutes to children from low-income families or rural communities, who would otherwise not be able to receive early-years education. It says there are 2.2 million children each year who do not have access to any publically-funded early-education programmes in the US. The charity says it wants to help make sure all children enter school on an equal footing. For those who cannot afford them, the project provides both devices and internet connectivity. However, in a statement issued to coincide with the launch of the prize fund, the CCFC, in conjunction with Defending the Early Years (DEY), wrote an open letter to TED. ""Firms like Upstart are poor substitutes for high-quality education, and funding online programs instead of high-quality early education will make inequality worse, not better,"" it read. Nancy Carlsson-Paige, an educational professor at Lesley University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, added in the letter: ""Kids learn by playing, exploring and interacting with adults - not by memorising letters, numbers and colours presented to them on screens."" In response, Upstart told the BBC that it was not an online platform but instead promoted ""kindergarten readiness"". ""We fully believe children need to learn through play, but technology is a wonderful tool if used correctly,"" it added. Police bias In total the Audacious Project has raised more than $280m, from a vast range of organisations and individuals, including the Skoll Foundation, Virgin Unite and Dalio Philanthropies. At launch, TED curator Chris Anderson said that each one of the winning projects had been ""vetted"". ""At a time when many people are fearful about humanity's prospects, these projects offer a beautiful counter-narrative of ingenuity, determination and hope,"" he said as he announced the winners. The other winning projects are:","The TED talk organisers have announced the Audacious Project, a $280m (£215m) prize fund to be shared across eight projects it feels tackle the world's toughest challenges."
"By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor The researcher said other details had also been taken that would let attackers pinpoint where the equipment was being used, making more targeted hacks possible. Pen Test Partners' Ken Munro wants thousands of routers to be replaced. But TalkTalk said it had not seen evidence to confirm the thefts. ""As is widely known, the Mirai worm is affecting many ISPs [internet service providers] around the world and it has affected a small number of TalkTalk customers,"" a spokeswoman said. ""We continue to take steps to review any potential impacts and have deployed a variety of solutions to ensure customers' routers remain safe. ""We have also employed additional network-level controls to further protect our customers."" The BBC revealed last week that TalkTalk's D-Link DSL-3780 routers had been struck by malware causing connectivity issues for those customers using the model. The firm subsequently published advice online telling affected users to reset the equipment - which forced it to install an update to protect itself against the attack - and then ""use the wireless network name and password on the back of the router"" to get back online. Security researcher Mr Munro obtained one of the affected routers to study the attack. He said his ""honeypot"" router was hit by the variant of Mirai, which is now being referred to as TR-06FAIL. But in addition to the connectivity issue, Mr Munro detected that a follow-up attack involving the same malware caused the device to disclose its wi-fi password and Service Set Identifier (SSID) code. An SSID code can be used to reveal where a machine is located via online tools such as Wigle. As a consequence, he said, even after subscribers had restarted their routers they could remain at risk if they continued using the same password as before. ""Most consumers never change the wi-fi keys written on the back of their router, so the fix didn't actually fix the problem,"" Mr Munro explained. ""Once an attacker has got the wi-fi key, if they go near to the house they can get nearly everything from their home network. ""TalkTalk should seriously consider replacing customer routers immediately unless it can prove they haven't been compromised."" Encrypted communications - such as online banking records - would not be at risk. But emails might be and it would be possible to place malware on computers linked to an exposed network. Mr Munro estimated that the recall would involve at least 55,000 routers. TalkTalk's spokeswoman said it ""firmly"" disputed that number, saying the number of routers infected had been ""nothing in that order of magnitude"". ""Our security team does not believe there is any greater risk that a customer's wi-fi can be used or accessed without their permission as a result of this,"" she added. But Mr Munro countered that some of the routers hit by the password-stealing attack might not have had their internet connectivity disrupted, despite the same vulnerability being exploited. Password change An independent researcher who checked the findings said Mr Munro had reason to be concerned, but added it was not clear who had scooped up the passwords. ""It's possible they are just security researchers, but also reasonably possible that they are actually criminals that intend to exploit this information,"" said Dr Steven Murdoch from University College London. ""Even if it's the latter, they would have to sit outside your house to do it."" Dr Murdoch said the risk was still high enough that TalkTalk needed to address it, but said there were alternatives to recalling the routers. ""The hardware is fine, what needs to be replaced is the wi-fi password. ""The problem is how to send a new password to all the affected customers. ""If TalkTalk does this online or over the phone, that leaves the customers open to phishing attacks, where a scammer says: 'As you heard on the news you need to change your password, please do these things...'"" TalkTalk's spokeswoman said some customers who had called in had been advised to change their wi-fi passwords, but the firm's security team now believed the step was unnecessary despite Mr Munro's warnings.","TalkTalk customers' wi-fi passwords have been stolen following a malware attack that blocked their internet access last week, an expert has warned."
"It follows a string of high-profile gang rapes in the country. The watch, developed by the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing, can be used to alert authorities and family members if the wearer is in danger. The wearer can send a message to the nearest police station or chosen relatives by pressing a button. The GPS system will pinpoint the location. The watch will also feature a built-in camera that can record for up to half an hour.

The government has held initial talks with state-run telecom equipment maker ITI Ltd about manufacturing the watch, it said. The brutal gang rape and murder of a young woman in Delhi in December raised questions about how well the country is protecting women from sexual violence. It led to nationwide protests with campaigners calling for tougher rape laws. This month, a 21-year-old factory worker living in a suburb of Delhi was found dead, allegedly another victim of gang rape. Meanwhile in Goa, a seven-year-old girl was raped in a school toilet. The cases have sparked a search for technologies that can help and Indian trade group Nasscom recently announced a competition for firms to develop apps specifically focused on keeping women safe.",The Indian government is working on a GPS watch that it hopes will help in the fight against rape.
"John Carmack is famed for developing the first-person shooter genre, creating games such as Doom and Quake. He will join Oculus VR to work on Oculus Rift, a goggle-like device which uses two small screens to ""immerse"" players into a game. The company has not yet announced a release date for the headset. However, developer kits have been sent out to companies keen to make use of the device within their titles. The Oculus Rift, which has been made thanks in part to $2.4m (£1.5m) raised through crowd-funding site Kickstarter, requires the user to wear a black headset, the front of which contains two small screens, each displaying a slightly different perspective on the same scene. The effect is one of being ""in"" the game - if the player moves his or her head around, the scene changes accordingly. 'Transformative technology' Movement is still achieved by using a traditional controller, although other designers have experimented with creating treadmill-like add-ons for the device. Early demo models of the headset used a single screen divided to produce two 640 by 800 pixel images - one for each eye - but it is likely that the version that gets released publicly will be in high-definition. Mr Carmack said: ""Now is a special time. I believe that VR will have a huge impact in the coming years, but everyone working today is a pioneer. ""The paradigms that everyone will take for granted in the future are being figured out today. I'm extremely excited to make a mark in what I truly believe will be a transformative technology."" Mr Carmack is best known for founding iD Software, the firm responsible for the likes of Wolfenstein 3D, Doom, Quake and others - all of which pushed boundaries in what remains one of the most popular gaming formats. Mr Carmack said he will continue to work with iD, but that his main focus was now on Oculus VR. He also runs a small aerospace company, however this has been put in ""hibernation mode"" following various setbacks including a crashed rocket.",A firm developing a hotly-tipped virtual reality gaming headset has hired a gaming pioneer to be its chief technology officer.
"Some boxes or ""TV sticks"" support software add-ons that can stream subscription movies, sport and TV channels over the internet for free.

The statements were made in the annual crime report of the government's intellectual property office (IPO). What are Kodi boxes? Kodi is free software, built by volunteers, that is designed to bring videos, music, games and photographs together in one easy-to-use application. Some shops sell set-top boxes and TV sticks known as Kodi boxes, preloaded with the software. The developers behind Kodi say their software does not contain any content of its own and is designed to play legally owned media or content ""freely available"" on the internet. However, the software can be modified with third-party add-ons that provide access to pirated copies of films and TV series, or provide free access to subscription television channels. ""Streaming boxes have steadily increased in popularity in recent years,"" said Ernesto van der Sar, from the news site Torrent Freak. ""Most use the entirely legal Kodi software, but some are augmented with illegal third-party add-ons. ""They are seen as convenient, as the set-top box format is ideal for the living room. ""Nowadays people often prefer to stream pirated content instead of using traditional torrent sites. ""They see streaming as more convenient and less cumbersome than downloading."" Fact said set-top boxes configured to receive premium content for free were ""an emerging threat to the audiovisual industry"". ""This is becoming an epidemic,"" Kieron Sharp, director general of Fact, told the BBC. ""If you are not paying for Sky, BT or one of the pay-TV providers for your subscription channels, you are clearly in possession of an illegal box."" The IPO said the increased availability of such devices presented a ""significant challenge"". ""We are aware that set-top boxes, while perfectly legal in their own right, are frequently adapted by criminals to illegally receive TV channels protected by intellectual property rights,"" a spokesman told the BBC. ""The government is working with its partners in industry and with police forces across the country to target criminals looking to profit from this activity. ""We are also working closely with our international partners to target the cross-border infrastructure that underpins illegal streaming."" In August, an investigation by the Police Intellectual Property Crime Unit (Pipcu) led to the arrest of three men who are accused of retransmitting subscription television channels online. What do the makers of Kodi say? Some traders sell so-called ""fully-loaded Kodi boxes"", which are preloaded with third-party add-ons that can access pirated content. These are currently the subject of a legal case. The developers behind Kodi have said they do not support ""piracy add-ons"" and have criticised those who advertise ""fully-loaded"" set-top boxes for sale. The group said it would maintain a ""neutral stance on what users do with their own software"", but would battle those using the Kodi trademark to sell a ""fully-loaded Kodi box"". Discussions about ""pirated content"" and add-ons that provide access are removed from its message board.","Tackling the use of Kodi and other set-top box software to stream pirated videos is now the top priority for rights-holders, a report says."
"By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor The latest rulings cover 53 services in total and apply to the country's six leading net providers. It brings the tally of blocked sites providing access to copyright-infringing content to 93 since the first restrictions began in 2012. But one expert warned that workarounds and alternatives would probably mean users continued to break the law. A spokesman for the Motion Picture Association - which had made 32 of the requests - said that several lists of sites had been processed at the same time, accounting for the large number involved. They include: ""Securing court orders requiring ISPs [internet service providers] to block access to illegal websites is an accepted and legitimate measure to tackle online copyright infringement,"" said Chris Marcich, president of the MPA's European division. ""It carefully targets sites whose sole purpose is to make money off the back of other people's content while paying nothing back into the legitimate economy."" Twenty-one of the sites were a result of a court order prompted by the BPI, a music industry group. Many of the services hosted links to pirated software, TV shows and ebooks in addition to films and songs. The ISPs affected are Sky, BT, Everything Everywhere, TalkTalk, O2 and Virgin. ""BT will only block access to websites engaged in online copyright infringement when ordered by a court to do so,"" said the UK's biggest broadband provider, reflecting a stance shared by the other firms. 'Deters a few' Many of the torrents used to provide downloads of the copied media are listed on multiple services, so taking a specific site offline does not necessarily prevent access to the files themselves. However, it can make them harder to find, as well as reducing the number of advert views a blocked site received, which in turn hits the amount of income that goes to their administrators. The UK's net providers first began blocking such sites in May 2012 after the music industry requested the action against the Pirate Bay under the Copyright Designs and Patents Act. ""It deters a few people who can't access their usual sites, but most people will try to find ones that are not yet blocked or use VPNs [virtual private networks] or proxy sites to get the same content,"" said Ernesto Van Der Sar, editor of the Torrentfreak news site. ""It's making it harder - some people will decide it's just too much trouble and give up - but the overwhelming majority will still find ways to download material illegally."" The action has also spurred piracy services to become more innovative. Recently one released code that adds film torrent links to the Motion Picture Association's own search engine, undermining its effort to inform the public where to purchase or rent legal copies. ""The Internet Services Providers' Association has long argued that web blocking is a relatively blunt tool,"" said the organisation's spokesman Craig Melson. ""The entertainment industry should continue to adapt its business models as consumption habits evolve with technology.""",The High Court has ordered the biggest batch yet of piracy websites to be blocked.
"The three processors are BitPay, Coinbase and GoCoin. The service has gone live and will initially be available to sellers of digital goods based in North America. However, the payments will not be processed by Paypal itself, the company confirmed. ""We're proceeding gradually, supporting Bitcoin in some ways today and holding off on other ways until we see how things develop,"" wrote Scott Ellison, senior director of corporate strategy in a blog post on the Paypal website. ""Paypal has always embraced innovation, but always in ways that make payments safer and more reliable for our customers. Our approach to Bitcoin is no different."" Last month Paypal announced that its subsidiary unit Braintree, a payment processor used by firms such as Uber and Airbnb, was also looking at ways to handle Bitcoin payments. Scott Green, founder of UK Bitcoin price comparison site Bittybot, said the new partnership was significant. ""I think we will look back at this announcement from Paypal as being a major turning point in the mainstream adoption both of Bitcoin and its payment system being taken seriously by businesses,"" he told the BBC.",Paypal is teaming up with three major Bitcoin payment processors so that certain retailers will be able to receive payments in the virtual currency via the firm's payment hub.
"By Chris FoxTechnology reporter Launched in 2011 and competing with Facebook and Twitter, it was Google's fourth attempt at a social network. But the platform failed to win people over, even after Google pushed it upon the thriving YouTube community. By the end of 2011, analysts were already writing obituaries. But Google decided to close the site only after discovering a data breach, in 2018. What was Google+? Google+ was launched as an invite-only platform in June 2011, before opening up to the public later in the year. It had many of the features typical of social networks, with the ability to post photos and status updates on individual feeds. However, Google also described it as a ""social layer"" designed to work across all its services. Its key features included the ability to sort friends into ""Circles"" and make group video calls with ""Hangouts"". Google boasted that millions of people had signed up within weeks of the launch. The problem was few people were using it. ""I click on my newsfeed and see tumbleweed blowing through the barren, blank page,"" wrote Paul Tassi, for Forbes, within weeks of the platform's launch. ""It's a vast and empty wasteland, full of people who signed up but never actually stuck around to figure out how things worked."" What went wrong? ""Google+ was destined to fail from day one,"" says Matt Navarra, a social media consultant. ""Issues with an unwieldy and changeable UI [user interface], being the latecomer versus giants like Facebook, a disjointed user experience, and rumours of internal disagreements about how Google+ would be leveraged"" all affected the platform, he says. Google+ operated a strict real-name policy and banned people who used pseudonyms or screen names, often locking them out of other Google services such as Gmail. Unusually, it also went after brands and businesses that set up profiles, deleting their pages. It later admitted this had been a mistake and decided businesses could set up Google+ profiles after all. But those that did sign up to take a look were often confused by what they saw. Where Facebook had ""likes"", and Twitter had ""Favourites"", Google+ had the cumbersomely branded ""Plus One"" button. ""If you liked this post, make sure you've Plus-Oned it,"" said nobody ever. What did Google do next? In a bid to boost engagement, Google ""integrated"" the social network with services such as Gmail. Then, in 2013, it wrapped its tentacles around YouTube. Following the merger, anybody who wanted to comment on YouTube videos had to have a Google+ account. The move attracted fury from prominent video-makers who felt their success was being used to prop up the struggling social network. App reviewers on the Google Play store were also required to have a Google+ account. Suddenly Google+ appeared to be alive with activity, as YouTube comments, ""liked"" videos and app store reviews were automatically cross-posted on the platform. Google boasted that the platform had 500 million users - but how many were engaging? ""I look at the profiles of the family and friends I invited to join and find that their presence in Google's shiny new world ranges from sparse to non-existent,"" wrote BBC News technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones in 2011. ""The big question is whether the 750 million people who currently use Facebook and the 100 million who are signed up to Twitter will decide they need to move - or need yet another social network in their lives."" What killed Google+? In April 2014, the founder of Google+, Vic Gundotra, left the company and changes came swiftly. Successful features such as Hangouts and Photos were separated from Google+ and run as independent services. Google started to disentangle Google+ from its apps such as YouTube and Google Play, much to the delight of video- and app-makers. In 2015, Google+ had a makeover designed to focus on ""communities"" but this also failed to ignite interest in the platform. In the end, it was the discovery of two data breaches that spurred Google to close the platform. In 2018, it admitted bugs in its software meant the private information of up to 52 million members had been accessible by third-party developers. Suddenly, Google was happy to admit that few people genuinely used the platform. ""The consumer version of Google+ currently has low usage and engagement - 90% of Google+ user sessions are less than five seconds,"" it said in a blog. Google+ has now been commemorated on both the Google Graveyard the Google Cemetery websites, which keep a record of the search giant's failed projects. The Google Cemetery site was created by Naeem Nur ""to make my friends keep on working on their new ideas, even if they fail"".","Google+, the search giant's failed social network, will finally be laid to rest on Tuesday morning."
"Researchers used 1.2 billion tweets containing at least one of the most popular 64 emojis to develop DeepMoji. The algorithm learned first to predict which emoji was likely to be used and then to recognise sarcasm, allowing it to spot hate speech faster than humans. It could also be used to assess how people really feel about different brands or to improve human interaction with smart programs such as chatbots. ""Because we can't use intonation in our voice or body language to contextualise what we are saying, emojis are the way we do it online,"" Prof Iyad Rahwan told MIT's Technology Review magazine. Prof Iyad Rahwan and graduate student Bjarke Felbo have created a website inviting people to refine DeepMoji's education by submitting and annotating their own messages. The pair also plan to release the algorithm's code so it can be used by other researchers. ""Using emojis as labels for training neural networks is a great idea,"" said Prof Kerstin Dautenhahn who studies human-machine interaction at the University of Hertfordshire. ""Applying it to tweets seems also a smart choice, since communication via tweets is much more impoverished than actual face-to-face conversation,"" she said, ""so chances are better for the algorithms to work."" Prof Dautenhahn raised doubts about the wide range of human activity that was now being monitored and analysed to try to guess what people think and feel. ""Are we happy with more and more detailed profiles of us being created?"" she asked.",Emoji icons have helped scientists train computers to understand sarcasm.
"As an example, the social network told the BBC it had fact-checked user-generated coverage from the recent Charlottesville protests with local police before highlighting the posts. The approach contrasts with that of its rival Facebook. Facebook used to employ an editorial team to curate its trending news section, but disbanded it last year. The larger company now relies on algorithms and external services to help tackle so-called ""fake news"". Snapchat's audience is a fraction of Facebook's. The former recently reported having 173 million active daily users, while the latter said it had more than two billion monthly ones. However, one research company has said Snapchat is set to prove more popular with young adults in the US this year. Driver arrest Although Snapchat is best known for its self-deleting messaging service and augmented reality selfie filters, its owner, Snap, is also keen to highlight the ways it is investing in becoming a source of news. CNN has recently started streaming a daily show on the platform, and several other mainstream media outlets make content available via its Discover facility. But Nick Bell, vice-president of content at Snap, was also keen to discuss how the app had curated videos of James Alex Fields Jr - the main suspect in the killing of a woman near a white supremacist rally in Virginia - filmed by its users. ""We have a news team - we have journalists who work at Snapchat, who are looking at content that comes in and are evaluating it, are determining whether it is accurate, whether it is relevant and how we can add additional context,"" Mr Bell, from Alnwick, Northumberland, told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme. ""So, if you look at some of the events in Chartlottesville, for example, in recent weeks, we actually received Snaps from members of our community of the driver being arrested. ""Before we published these Snaps, we actually verified with the police to make sure that... the snaps that we were posting to our 173 million daily active users were of what we thought they were. ""And we added a layer of context above that as well to describe what had happened. ""We also inserted into that story warnings of graphic content. ""So, we think that putting journalists into the fold is very important."" Mr Bell did not refer to Facebook by name. However, Mark Zuckerberg's company has faced criticism that it helped promote dozens of false stories after stopping using human editors. The company responded late last year by highlighting some of the processes it had put in place to tackle the issue, including studying whether people became less likely to share an article if they had read it. Since then, it has announced several follow-up measures, the most recent of which is to block advertisers who repeatedly share stories that third-party fact-checkers have flagged as being false. However, explaining these processes to the public is inherently more challenging than Snap's ability to talk about its own in-house team of editors. Mr Bell was also asked whether Snapchat could be used to help inspire others to commit violence. ""We take both terrorism and hate speech very very seriously, and we have zero tolerance,"" he said. ""By design, Snapchat has been built to allow you to communicate with your best friends. ""We actually make it pretty difficult for you to build a large following. ""The situation that we live in today is that you could be approached on the street by a radical preacher, and it's very difficult to protect everyone from everything at any time. ""What I am saying it that it's much harder for radicalists to emerge and create a large following on Snapchat than it maybe is on other platforms.""",Snapchat has said its in-house team of journalists play a key role in helping it cover the news accurately.
"Users can now make calls to each other via the Facebook Messenger app anywhere they have a wi-fi or a cellular-data connection. The feature could be a boon for heavy talkers as they would avoid carrier call charges. Facebook said it was working on adding the feature to its Messenger app for Android and BlackBerry users. Within the app, all a person needs to do is open a conversation with a partner, tap the ""i"" icon in the upper right hand corner and select ""Free Call"". The calls, however, can only be made to another user who has Messenger installed on their iPhone. Users can neither call a Facebook friend who is logged in through the website or call a landline. The latest mobile-to-mobile development was independent of the free video-calling software Skype, which was already integrated into Facebook's website, a spokesman said. The Messenger app is limited to voice calling. The official said Facebook was expected to roll out the feature in its Messenger app for other operating systems and expand it overseas. On Tuesday, Facebook unveiled a smart search engine - called Graph Search - that allows users to make ""natural"" searches of content shared by their friends.",Facebook has added a feature in its mobile phone app that allows free calling for US iPhone users.
"By Dave LeeTechnology reporter, BBC News Jake Davis, 20, was convicted of computer hacking for his role in the notorious group LulzSec. He cannot contact anyone who associates themselves with the wider Anonymous hacktivist collective. He told the BBC he planned to release a prison diary and to write a film about the internet. Davis returned to Twitter on 22 June after finishing his 37-day term at Feltham young offender institution. During that time he penned what he described as a ""nerdy"" diary, written using pen and paper, which he hopes to publish online once it has been subjected to legal checks. He is forbidden from creating encrypted files, securely wiping any data or deleting his internet history. In June 2012 he pleaded guilty to being part of LulzSec, an offshoot of Anonymous famed for attacking several high profile sites including Sony Pictures and the UK's Serious Organised Crime Agency. Shortly after being released, he tweeted: ""654 days on curfew and 37 days in Feltham. Up next: Another 365 days on licence (parole) and 1,825 days of intense monitoring. Free though!"" He had been sentenced to 24 months - but he had been wearing an electronic tag for 21 months which counted against his term. Licking elbows Davis is now based in Islington, north London, where he said he was working on a number of projects. He said he had begun an unspecified project with contemporary art firm Artangel - the company told the BBC it had had ""several exploratory chats with Jake over the past six months"", but would not go into further detail. Longer term, he told the BBC he would write a fictional film about the internet, working with production company Fly Film, who could not be reached for comment on Monday. Publically on Twitter, he has been sharing anecdotes about his time inside. In one post, he wrote: ""I was sacked as a prison cleaner for mopping too near a computer. Those deadly, soapy mops are a serious threat to GCHQ, make no mistake!"" As alter ego Topiary, Davis's last tweet before his arrest in July 2011 read: ""You cannot arrest an idea."" On Sunday, in a nod to that sign off, Davis joked: ""You can arrest an idea, you can imprison an idea, you can warp an idea, you can break an idea, but you still can't lick your own elbow."" While he wishes to distance himself from the hacking world, he has pledged support to Edward Snowden, the former US intelligence contractor who leaked secret documents regarding the monitoring of internet users. At the time of Davis's sentencing, prosecutors said the actions of the LulzSec group had been ""cowardly and vindictive"". ""The harm they caused was foreseeable, extensive and intended,"" said Andrew Hadik, a lawyer for the Crown Prosecution Service. ""Indeed, they boasted of how clever they were with a complete disregard for the impact their actions had on real people's lives."" He added: ""This case should serve as a warning to other cybercriminals that they are not invincible.""",A convicted hacker who was detained in a young offender institution has been released - but will now face strict limitations on his technology use.
"By Nick KwekBBC Click reporter Moments earlier a hurled rock from over the fence whacked the tin roof next to us with an almighty thud. Its target: Agent Hernandez, my camerawoman and yours truly. ""You gotta limit your exposure when you're there by the International Fence, you know,"" says Agent Hernandez, once we're safely back in his truck. I do now. We are in southern Arizona at the Nogales Border Crossing checkpoint. While President Trump demands a wall costing several billions of dollars, and the Democrats suggest technology would be better suited to the job, we are being given a whistle-stop tour of some of the tech already in use within Arizona's Tucson Sector. As we ride around, Agent Hernandez tells me his Southwest Border sector has 262 miles (422km) of border fencing with Mexico, but thousands of miles of patrol area. Recently his team enhanced its surveillance abilities by upgrading their Integrated Fixed Towers, also known as IFTs - almost everything is abbreviated by US government employees. The structures are up to 180ft (55m) tall and are laden with sensors at their top. The update means they are now equipped with longer-range video cameras, better thermal imaging cameras, and radar to provide 24/7 high altitude points of view for officers back at the Nogales Control Center. ""Before we'd see some pixellation,"" Agent Hernandez explains. ""The cameras, due to their remote placements, were difficult to focus from far away, but now we have really high resolution, crisp images."" He goes on: ""We're able to identify things that come over the fence, people that come over the fence, contraband that comes over the fence, a lot quicker and at greater distances."" Agent Hernandez slows the car to a stop, leaning forward in his seat and peers out into the hills. ""I believe there's one person under that tree. He's a human smuggler scout,"" he declares. He points at the man dressed in brown clothing and a hat, sitting a few yards beyond the fence. Agent Hernandez may be hawk-eyed, but come nightfall a scout like this would be tricky to see, even for him. The IFTs though apparently help his team catch camouflaged crossers. ""We might not see them, but our thermal cameras allow us to see. Our tech helps us stay one step above the criminal element."" We travel down the winding road to Mariposa Wash, an area where there is a 1m gap between the fence's bottom and the ground. The gap is there to prevent erosion from water, but it means a person could easily duck underneath. ""We don't want people thinking this is the only thing keeping America safe,"" comments Agent Hernandez, patting the suspended barrier. ""We have fencing as a tool - but this is by no means meant to keep people in or out."" A few minutes up the road and the steel fencing stops, only to be replaced by sticks, cattle wire and Normandy-style barriers. It looks very makeshift, but this style of vehicle fencing stretches out across a large portion of Arizona's border with Mexico. Instead of fencing, border agents have a range of other tools in their arsenal. I am told sensors are buried in the ground around the area, which trigger an alarm if someone or something big enough passes nearby. Mobile Surveillance Trucks are also in use where there is uneven terrain and the towers cannot be built. They are equipped with the same technology as the IFTs, but have thermal rangefinders that enable remote operators to measure the distance between themselves and people crossing. They also have laser pointers to direct agents in the field to hidden targets at night. From the truck's extendable mast, they can shine a beam of light on to a suspect so agents wearing night-vision goggles can physically find them. US Customs and Border Protection has also begun testing drones equipped with infrared and facial recognition cameras to monitor the land from above. Agent Hernandez tells me his team is currently trialling an Android-based location-tracking app, so agents can keep tabs of each others' whereabouts in real-time. In 2017, Agent Hernandez's team arrested 40,000 people attempting to cross illegally into the United States. But of course it's not always criminals that get caught in the net. The recent migrant caravans - in which hundreds of people travel together - have highlighted how many families are willing to undertake a perilous journey in hope of a better life in the States. Many families have been separated at the border, and two children have died since being detained by authorities. For Agent Hernandez, he says he's just doing his job. ""No matter what side of the spectrum you fall on, border security is important for the entire country"" he says. ""We're law enforcement officers, we don't dictate the laws, we enforce the laws. ""The best way to enforce the laws is by doing it in most effective and efficient way, and technology allows us to do that.""","""We gotta get outta here!"" cries Agent Daniel Hernandez of US Border Patrol."
"All the grounded drones were made in China or use Chinese parts, the Wall Street Journal reports. The call to stop using the autonomous craft was made by Interior Secretary David Bernhardt, who also ordered a review of the security risks they pose. Only drones helping in emergencies will be allowed to fly. Full control The Department of the Interior uses drones extensively to look after federal territories and manages the nation's natural resources. Drones help keep an eye on dams, inspect land, monitor environmental damage and endangered species. They also help emergency workers manage wildfires, floods and other natural disasters. The memo from Mr Bernhardt said a decision about whether the drones could be used again would be made once the security investigation had been completed. Technology news website The Verge reported the agency was concerned the drones could transmit images and video to China about key installations, which may leave them open to future attacks. American politicians are currently debating a bill that would stop government bodies and agencies buying Chinese made or developed drones. The DoI action follows a warning issued in May by the country's Cyber-security and Infrastructure Security Agency. In a memo, it said the US had ""strong concerns"" about the growing number of Chinese drones used by government agencies. Soon after, drone-maker DJI, which has a 70% share of the US market, said customers had ""full and complete control"" over what was done with the data its craft gathered. In August 2017, the US Army prohibited troops from using DJI's drones, because of unspecified cyber-security concerns. The decision is part of a larger US government push to limit how much Chinese technology is used in America. As well as trade tariffs, this action has also involved stopping Chinese telecoms giant Huawei operating in the US.",More than 800 drones have been grounded by the US Department of the Interior (DoI) over concerns they could be used to aid Chinese spying.
"By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter Take anaemia for instance, more than half the cases can easily be cured with a course of free iron pills, but if left untreated it is potentially fatal, especially for pregnant women. Massachusetts Institute of Technology graduate Myshkin Ingawale first heard about the problem from friends who worked as young doctors in remote areas of India. ""One in five deaths among pregnant women was traced back to this. I was not aware of this problem but my friends were seeing it on an ongoing basis in the field,"" he told the BBC. Mr Ingawale decided to put his technology background to the test and come up with a solution that would be easy for healthcare workers - often untrained - to use in the field. Lunch box ""I knew a little about technology and how to put things in a box,"" he said. He took his inspiration from an unlikely source - Hollywood. ""I had seen this machine in Hollywood movies - when someone was lying in a hospital bed they were hooked up to it,"" he told the BBC. The device he is talking about is a pulse oximeter, a non-invasive method of monitoring the oxygenation of haemoglobin using light. The patient is attached to the machine via a finger clip. A similarly non-invasive device was perfect for his needs because healthcare workers in India are often not trained to conduct blood tests using needles and lack the equipment to assess the results of such tests. ""I found that there was no commercial availability of a device to measure haemoglobin in the same way,"" said Mr Ingawale. So he set about designing one. ""When we first saw it is was just circuitry housed in a lunch box,"" said Noah Perin, commercialisation officer at the Program for the Appropriate Technology in Health (Path). Path follows the development of new medical technologies and has been looking for devices that can help detect anaemia for the past 20 years. No needle The finished product was a little more sophisticated, a hand-held, battery-operated device that can measure haemoglobin levels without the prick of a needle. Known as TouchHb, it comes with a probe into which the finger is inserted. When light-emitting diodes in the probe shine light through the nail, a photodiode on the other end interprets the absorption patterns to produce an instant reading of the volume of haemoglobin in the patient's blood. It can diagnose anaemia in less than a minute and is currently being piloted in clinics in South India as part of the vital data collection exercise that could see the device go commercial later this year. The batteries can be recharged and are expected to last for more than 100 tests. The probe will also require yearly maintenance. Mr Ingawale's firm, Biosense Technologies, aims to sell the machines for between $200 and $300 (£125-£188) and the cost of individual tests will be just 5 rupees (10 cents; 6p). The costs are outweighed by the benefits, he thinks. ""Pregnant women are recommended to get a haemoglobin test at least once in every trimester of their pregnancy but it is inconvenient for a women to walk to the nearest primary healthcare centre that could more than 5km away,"" he said. ""They do not feel sick enough to justify that trip that could even come against losing a day's wages, so a large number of women skip the screening and monitoring."" With this simple test, available in their own community, there is much greater likelihood of spotting and subsequently treating anaemia, he suggested. Local need ""We are quite excited about it because it is targeted at and developed for front-line health workers,"" said Mr Perin. ""This device won't cure anaemia but it can have a dramatic impact in alerting people to the fact that they have a problem,"" he added. Mr Ingawale wants to see more devices developed at grassroots level, based on the needs of patients in the field. ""There needs to be a rethink in the way healthcare is delivered to people. It needs to be far more decentralised. It can become a consumerist movement in the same way that Wikipedia has been for information,"" he said. Mr Perin agrees. ""We have seen devices like this before but they have been huge sophisticated machines made for the developed world and adapted. There is a real advantage in inventing devices based on local needs,"" he said.","Healthcare in rural India is often basic, meaning people die unnecessarily."
"Privacy International (PI) investigated more than 100 mental health websites in France, Germany and the UK. It found many shared user data with third parties, including advertisers and large technology companies. The way information was being sold was ""neither transparent nor fair and often lacked a clear legal basis"", it said. Nearly all the websites investigated had large number of cookies - computer files that download on to a user's device to enable tracking - three-quarters of which were there for marketing or advertising purposes, according to PI. 'Depression test' On average, each mental-health web pages contained: Many of the web pages contained cookies that enable targeted advertising from Google, Facebook and Amazon. And many used Hotjar, a company that provides software that allows everything users type or click on to be logged and played back. ""It is exceedingly difficult for people to seek mental-health information and for example take a 'depression test' without countless third parties watching,"" said Frederike Kaltheuner, PI's director of corporate exploitation. ""We visit these sites and reveal so much about ourselves and that should not be used by companies we have never heard of to track you around the internet and use the data in an opaque advertising eco-system."" Sensitive data The EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) raised the level of consent required before websites can download cookies on to a user's device. Its ePrivacy Directive requires users are given clear and comprehensive information about what data is being used and how. And in the case of particularly sensitive data, such as health information, this consent must be explicit. But the PI investigation found many cookies were installed on people's devices before any consent had been given. Programmatic advertising Some websites had no consent form, while those that did ask for consent did so in a very generic way, the report said. ""Most people don't have the time to navigate complicated consent boxes which nudge them towards consent,"" said Ms Kaltheuner. ""These sites should not have any more cookies than are strictly needed. ""Users should be able to say that they do not want to be tracked by Google, Facebook and data brokers."" PI also analysed nine websites that offered visitors quizzes about their mental health. Three of these had cookies that enabled tracking for programmatic advertising, where hundreds of companies bid in real-time for advertising space, it said. This was problematic because sensitive information could be broadcast to all of those bidding, PI said. Programmatic advertising is currently being investigated by the UK's information commissioner. PI also found Doctissimo.fr sent test answers, together with a unique identifier such as an IP address, to a third party - Player.qualifo.com, which had provided the test form.","Sensitive personal information about mental health is routinely being traded to advertisers around the web, a study has suggested."
"Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News@gordoncoreraon Twitter In January, the UK government approved a limited role for Huawei in building the country's new data networks. But in March, a backbench rebellion within the Conservative party signalled efforts to overturn the move. In an open letter, the firm also said it was focused on keeping the UK connected during the Covid-19 crisis. But the pandemic may increase pressure on the government to take a tougher line on the company. 'Slow lane' In the letter, Huawei's UK chief Victor Zhang says home data use has increased by at least 50% since the virus first hit the UK, placing ""significant pressure"" on telecoms systems. Huawei says it has been working with partners like BT, Vodafone and EE to deal with the growth and has also set up three new warehouses around the country to ensure spare parts stay in supply. Mr Zhang also says the current crisis has highlighted how many people, especially in rural communities, are ""stuck in a digital slow lane"". And he warns that excluding Huawei from a future role in 5G would be a mistake. ""There are those who choose to continue to attack us without presenting any evidence,"" he writes. ""Disrupting our involvement in the 5G rollout would do Britain a disservice."" The government has banned Huawei from the most sensitive parts of the UK's mobile networks, and limited it to 35% of the periphery, which includes its radio masts. But critics argue it is a security risk to allow the Chinese company to play any role at all because of fears it could be used by Beijing to spy on or even sabotage communications. In early March, 38 Conservatives MPs rebelled on the issue, a larger number than expected. That points to a potential upset when the Telecoms Infrastructure Bill comes before Parliament, which is planned to happen later in the year. The coronavirus crisis highlights the tension between economic and national security issues that makes the topic so contentious. On one side is the need for greater connectivity to boost economic growth. Supporters of Huawei's role argue that excluding it would both slow down and raise the cost of delivering faster and more reliable networks. On the other side is anger directed at China from some quarters because of its perceived mishandling of the initial Covid-19 outbreak, as well as the wider concerns over growing dependence on its technologies and companies. Unnamed ministers and senior officials were recently quoted as saying there would have to be a ""reckoning"" once the current crisis is over. Part of that could involve a reversal of January's decision - a concern which may explain the decision to write the letter. On 4 April a group of 15 Conservative MPs called for a rethink on relations with China in their own letter to the Prime Minister, written a day before he was admitted to hospital. ""Over time, we have allowed ourselves to grow dependent on China and have failed to take a strategic view of Britain's long-term economic, technical and security needs,"" the group wrote. Among the signatories were Iain Duncan Smith, David Davis and Bob Seely. It is understood that Huawei waited until the Prime Minister was out of hospital before releasing its letter.","Chinese telecoms company Huawei has said that disrupting its involvement in the rollout of 5G would do Britain ""a disservice""."
"The jury for the latest case had been selected but a deal was done in the early hours of the day the US trial was to begin, according to news site Ars Technica. Unwired Planet had sought $33m (£25.7m) and a cut of iPhone and iPad sales, which it said made use of its tech. The terms of the settlement have not been made public. Apple had previously described the case - involving voice recognition and data transmission inventions - as being ""frivolous"". Nevada-based Unwired used to develop mobile software, when it was known as Openwave Systems, but no longer makes products of its own. It acquired the rights to the inventions involved in the case from Ericsson in a controversial deal. Rather than purchase the technologies outright, Unwired instead agreed to share future revenues generated from the patents with the Swedish telecoms equipment-maker. That has led some to describe Unwired as a ""patent troll"" - although the firm's legal team described the term as ""hackneyed"". ""Our ambition is to bring efficiency and fairness to patent licensing and create a marketplace where product manufacturers and innovators feel confident that high quality technology is available at a fair and reasonable price,"" a spokeswoman for PanOptis Patent Management, which recently bought Unwired's licensing business, told the BBC. ""Over the past nine months since we acquired the Unwired Planet patent portfolio, we have actively resolved a majority of the existing litigation that had been initiated by Unwired Planet, including suits involving Samsung, LG and Apple."" Earlier this month, the firm scored a court victory over Huawei in London. The Chinese company was ordered to pay a global fee for use of Unwired's 4G patents or face a UK sales ban. Unwired previously won a case against Samsung involving 2G technologies. It is also involved in disputes with Google and HTC.",Apple has settled a patent dispute with a litigant that had already beaten Huawei and Samsung in court.
"By Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent Public services and safety will be carefully managed though data, while devices in our homes will talk to each other and the wider world as part of the ""internet-of-things"". Many of these services will be delivered over what is called 5G. It will be much more than just faster data on our phones, but potentially transformational for our lives - if you believe the hype. But there is a darker fear as well. What if it is also transformational for our security if we end up reliant on a Chinese company to deliver this future? That question risks causing a major divide in the Five Eyes - the intelligence alliance between the US, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. The US is campaigning hard among allies to exclude the Chinese telecoms giant Huawei from delivering 5G. ""We have serious concerns over Huawei's obligations to the Chinese government and the danger that poses to the integrity of telecommunications networks in the US and elsewhere,"" Bill Evanina, head of America's National Counterintelligence and Security Center has said. ""Chinese company relationships with the Chinese government aren't like private sector company relationships with governments in the West."" 'Rigorous oversight' Huawei has always denied being controlled by the Chinese government, or that its work poses any risks of espionage and sabotage. Its founder repeated these assertions in a recent interview with the BBC. But Australia and New Zealand have sounded negative about Huawei's involvement in their 5G networks to varying degrees, and Canada is still deciding. All eyes are now on the UK. In a speech in Brussels on Wednesday, Ciaran Martin, chief executive of the UK's National Cyber Security Centre, set out the framework for considering the security of 5G based on its experience so far of working with the company. The current oversight regime was ""arguably the toughest and most rigorous"" in the world for Huawei, he said. His officials say they have found ''poor security and engineering"" by the company, but the indications are still that the UK may work with Huawei on 5G. If that is the decision then other countries - not only in the Five Eyes but also the EU and Nato - may well be tempted to follow, using the UK as a reference point because of its track record of scrutiny. There could be consequences, former officials warn. ""Worries about the security of UK networks following their exposure to Huawei may make the Five Eyes partners, and perhaps others such as France, Germany or Japan, less inclined to co-operate with the UK in the future,"" Charles Parton, a former British diplomat, argues in a new paper for the think tank Rusi. ""The maintenance of a 'Five Eyes standard' of cyber-security in telecommunications is a vital strategic and security interest, the loss of which would go far beyond a reduction in intelligence reports exchanged, and might lead to the UK being excluded from work on developing future technologies for intelligence collection."" 'Resilience is key' The UK's special relationship with Huawei came about in the early 2000s, when BT was upgrading its networks and the Chinese firm came in much cheaper than the alternatives - by hundreds of millions of pounds. BT told the government it planned to use the company unless the government was willing to compensate it. Even though Huawei was kept out of the core of the network and sensitive systems, concerns over security and the growing use of Huawei by other companies led - a few years later - to the creation of a ""cell"" to evaluate the security of Huawei products coming into the UK. The cell's last oversight report downgraded the assurance about mitigating the risks associated with Huawei, because of serious problems with security and engineering processes. However, Mr Martin said in his speech, the report said that these were not indicators of hostile activity by China, . The company says it will invest money to deal with these concerns in the coming years, although UK officials say that so far they have not seen ""a credible plan"". Despite that, the indications are that the UK wants to hold out against US pressure and continue to work with the company on 5G. A decision is expected in the next two months by ministers who will need to balance security with costs and the risks to wider relationships. ""Resilience is key,"" Mr Martin said in Brussels. ""There must be sustainable diversity in the supplier market."" That was one signal that even though the UK may work with Huawei, it is cautious about ending up with one dominant player on whom it is dependent. But critics fear that Huawei - possibly with Chinese state backing - is working its way into a dominant position in the long term, particularly by penetrating markets in the developing world and by setting standards for 5G. One of the biggest challenges with 5G is cost. Significant cost In many countries, telecoms companies paid much more for the 5G spectrum than they had expected. They are now looking at the sums and indicating their strong preference for the cheapest vendor - Huawei. Telecoms operators in the UK say the way in which 5G can work in a highly integrated system alongside 4G means that excluding Huawei is not realistic without significant cost and delay, including potentially removing existing hardware, leading to the UK falling behind. Breaking the ties with the company could also have significant consequences for the UK-China relationship which poses challenges with Brexit approaching. But the question will be how the US and the Trump administration reacts if the UK does not follow its line - especially if other countries use the UK as cover to follow and work with Huawei. This at a time when the UK may be looking for a post-Brexit trade deal with Washington. It potentially leaves the UK between a rock and a hard place and is one more reason why the Huawei decision is placing strain on the historically close Five Eyes intelligence relationship.","In the shiny, optimistic vision of the future we will all be living in ""smart cities"" in which self-driving cars will check the best routes after being charged up on intelligent, connected power grids."
"By Leo KelionTechnology reporter This isn't fantasy - if the Pentagon has its way robot squads will soon handle such man-made disasters. To spur on the technology the US defence headquarters' research unit has selected 17 teams and their machines - from more than 100 who applied - to compete in the Darpa Robotic Challenge (DRC) trials near Miami, Florida this Friday and Saturday. The finals will follow in a year's time to decide who wins the $2m (£1.2m) prize and gear-driven glory. ""This is a product that saves humanity,"" exclaims Prof Dennis Hong, director of Virginia Tech's Robotics & Mechanisms Laboratory, which is entering Thor - a humanoid adult-sized robot. ""These big competitions help make science-fiction ideas become reality. ""A Fukushima plant-like disaster is going to happen again, and we're just going to be sitting ducks if we don't do this."" Robots were sent into the Japanese nuclear plant after its 2011 meltdown, but only transmitted back video and other data rather than carrying out repairs. By contrast the DRC trials will be more demanding. They consist of eight tasks: Organisers recognise there may be more than few bumps and scrapes along the way. ""Right now, where we are is that robots are roughly at the same level of mobility and dexterity as a one-year-old child,"" explains Gill Pratt, DRC's manager. ""If you... know one-year-old children and watch them as they try to walk, or try to grasp things, what you'll see is that they fall down all the time. ""So, what you're going to see is robots moving quite slowly. ""You're also going to see that the robots are not at that level of task autonomy that we want them to be, but instead the human being operators are going to be helping out a great deal."" Engineers from South Korea, Hong Kong, mainland China, Germany and Japan are all taking part in addition to US teams. Most are entering their own machines, but others programming copies of a two-legged robot called Atlas provided by Boston Dynamics - a military contractor recently bought by Google. Seth Teller and his team from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) opted for Atlas. He describes the event as a ""game-changer"". ""People were already working on these problems,"" the professor says. ""But one of the real contributions Darpa has made is to say: 'Here are the specific tasks that your system has to perform.' ""And it has said you have to do these things under real conditions - that means outdoors, doing it without perfect knowledge of what the tasks will be ahead of time, and doing it over a highly-degraded network link. ""Instead of having a fast dedicated low latency link between the operators and the robot, Darpa is forcing everyone to communicate with a link that's slow and eventually - in 2014 - will have drop-outs. ""There will be periods of no communication between the humans and the robot. It will really have to act on its own to get something done."" Previous Darpa ""grand challenges"" called on researchers to build and test self-driving cars in desert and urban environments, helping accelerate the development of autonomous vehicles. Last time round, in 2007, Virginia Tech came third. This time Prof Hong's team has taken the high-risk strategy of using brand-new ""artificial muscles"" to try to win. ""In the past 30 years we roboticists have tried to get rid of springiness from a robot's joints to get precise motion,"" he explains. ""But now biologists are starting to understand the importance of springiness in the human muscle. So our robot Thor, in the lower body, has new types of springy actuators - not only to control its position but also its force."" He says the innovation should help the machine cope with uneven surfaces. Unfortunately the tech is so cutting-edge that it's not quite ready, meaning his team will have to field a substitute robot this weekend. Whatever Saturday's result, the team can still field Thor in next year's final - but a low score would mean it would miss out on receiving further funds from the Pentagon. Not everyone is comfortable about the US military developing close relationships with the teams. ""Why would Darpa suddenly want to spend millions of dollars on rescue robots at a time when defence budgets are so tight?"" asks Prof Noel Sharkey, co-founder of the International Committee for Robot Arms Control. ""It seems more likely that this is part of a long-term agenda to develop ever more sophisticated robot weapons. ""Those involved in competing should do so in the clear knowledge that they are helping the US develop the next generation of automated weapons systems."" Prof Hong acknowledges the contest could hasten development of Terminator-style killer robots, but stresses that its stated goal is to save - not destroy - lives. Even so, he recognises it will be some time before robots ride to the rescue. ""In a real nuclear power plant the radiation would kill all of the electronics,"" he notes. ""Radiation shielding is a big problem and will need years of research and development. ""But what I'm excited about is first the opportunity for us to draw up new breakthrough technologies, and second for the general public to really see what these robots are good for.""",The alarms wail. The nuclear reactor is breached and belching out toxic waste. A mere human would have no chance of survival. But the mechanised rescue team that clanks into action soon has the situation under control.
"The firm held data about people who had donated to the trust that manages the Bletchley Park museum. Harvard University has also joined the growing list of victims, which have mostly been charities and universities. Bletchley Park Trust said it was confident any exposed data was now secure. The trust added that data exposed to the hackers might have included names, dates of birth, email addresses, donation history and details of event attendance – but not credit and debit card details or bank account information. During World War Two, staff at the then-secret code-breaking site near Milton Keynes were responsible for decrypting messages sent by the German military. The mansion and grounds are now a museum open to the public. US-based Blackbaud is a major supplier of fundraising and financial management software to clients around the world. In July, it revealed that it had fallen victim to a ransomware attack in May. The company decided to pay an undisclosed sum to the attackers who then promised to destroy any stolen data and hand back control of Blackbaud’s systems. Many organisations have not yet publicly disclosed that they have been affected by the Blackbaud incident, meaning that individual cases are only gradually coming to light. The UK Information Commissioner’s Office has so far received 166 cases as part of its ongoing investigation into the incident. The Charity Commission, which regulates charities in England and Wales, said it had received 91 serious incident reports. And OSCR, the Scottish Charity Regulator, said six charities had raised a “notifiable event” over the Blackbaud breach. The Donkey Sanctuary in Devon confirmed to the BBC that it was among the victims. “Blackbaud have informed us that, to the best of their knowledge, all of the details that were accessed have now been destroyed and there is currently no evidence of the data being used,” a spokesman said. The BBC had previously confirmed that more than two dozen charities and universities in the UK, the US and Canada were hit by the breach. In recent days, other additional victims to emerge included: That Bletchley Park, the home of wartime hacking in Britain, has been linked to the Blackbaud breach is “a bit ironic” said cyber-security expert Steven Murdoch at University College London. However, he pointed out that the trust that manages the museum and grounds today would not have the resources of a government-run intelligence agency at its disposal. Dr Murdoch added that it was understandable that Blackbaud had decided to pay the cyber-criminals a ransom, given that the firm would have wanted to appease its attackers since they potentially had the power to release huge swathes of sensitive data on the web. This means that the old tactic of refusing to pay up and relying on backups may fall flat when organisations can be threatened with the publication of private information stolen from their servers. “I think the criminals have changed their strategy,” said Dr Murdoch.","The home of hacking in wartime Britain, Bletchley Park, was one of the victims of a major ransomware attack that hit software provider Blackbaud."
"By Katia MoskvitchTechnology reporter, BBC News Having hit the country's so-called Great Firewall, Google Drive has joined a host of other services banned in the communist nation, such as YouTube, Google+, Twitter, Dropbox, Facebook and Foursquare. When the firm checked for technical issues on its side, it found none, a Google spokesman told the BBC. ""If people are unable to access Google Drive in China... it's an issue to take up with the Chinese authorities,"" he said. The restriction does indeed seem to come from Beijing, but it is not a surprise, say analysts. The Chinese government has been notoriously unfriendly towards a number of Western websites and online services, mostly targeting social media networks and video sharing sites that could have a mass impact on ""the community"", notes Duncan Clark, a chairman of BDA China, a consultancy firm in Beijing. ""It's a question of control - and the Chinese authorities like to keep close control of web content, preferring to work with local internet content providers, on whom they can rely for self-censorship of content,"" says Mr Clark. Cracks in wall And to exercise this control, the state closely monitors internet traffic within the country and all web content that crosses its borders. This Great Chinese Firewall uses several tools. All internet traffic into China passes through a small number of gateways, giving the government a chance to control the information. Sometimes Beijing will block access to a site that has been blacklisted by the government. The authorities may also prevent the look-up of certain domain names, thus causing a ""site not found"" error message on the user's screen. If a site is not on any blacklist but its URL - web address - contains a prohibited word, the site may be blocked - and this may also happen if a prohibited keyword is published anywhere on the page a user is viewing. Censorship can be done more subtly as well - for example by filtering posts with prohibited keywords on the country's social media platforms and erasing comments shortly after they have been posted on microblogging sites. But the Great Firewall does have cracks. For instance, in February US President Barack Obama's Google+ account was flooded with comments from China, after a gap in the firewall temporarily allowed Chinese users to access the social network. ""The Firewall doesn't work perfectly, it is in fact full of holes,"" says Hamid Sirhan, a strategist at social media agency FreshNetworks in London. ""To go round the restrictions, Chinese netizens use proxies to 'tunnel' through the wall, and they often work around blocked search terms by using sometimes-humorous homonyms."" Special software like JonDonym, Tor and Ultrasurf help web users to break through the Chinese government's restrictions. Although it is possible for more technically-savvy internet users to access banned Western websites and services, most Chinese are perfectly content with home-grown alternatives, he adds. Web clones And there are plenty of them. China is known for cloning the Western web world, with one key difference: these sites are self-policing and conform to local laws. The government's restrictions on foreign web services only help local firms to thrive, says Mr Clark of BDA. For instance, with YouTube blocked, China's leading video website Youku is thriving. Sina Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of microblogging site Twitter, already has 300 million users - more than twice as many as the Western original. With access to Google's search hampered by China's firewall, Baidu dominates the country's search traffic - without showing any search results that are inconvenient to the Beijing government. Baidu may not let you find out much on the violent suppression of protests in Tiananmen Square in 1989, and many other search terms are censored, but it will deliver the right content for most common searches. Baidu's latest cloud service Wangpan, announced just weeks before the launch of Google Drive, beats Google by offering 25GB of free storage - as much as Microsoft's Skydrive and much more than Google's 5GB. Although banning foreign firms may give a short-term boost to Chinese tech entrepreneurs, it could hurt the country in the long run, says Mr Clark. ""What if these Chinese companies wanted to go global and succeed?"" he asks. ""We all know that China is the manufacturing workshop of the world, but it is now trying to move up, to become much more interested in design, and the government wants to influence the image of China overseas, get it to participate in global industries. ""So if these companies are this much protected domestically, then in the long run it means that they're not as capable functioning overseas. ""But the government is more focused on the short term concerns about control and doesn't seem to think ahead."" Cat-and-mouse And Beijing should also be wary of possible future discontent among Chinese netizens, he adds - not only because they are not allowed to access Google and other Western sites, but also because of the censorship at home. When the authorities recently disabled the commenting function on local microblogs, they only managed to keep up the restrictions for three days - and then the service went back to normal. ""The state and the Chinese netizens have been playing a cat-and-mouse game,"" says Mr Clark. ""I will be interesting to see who will win - although I don't think Beijing is ready to give in any time soon.""","Google may have rolled out its cloud-storage Google Drive last week, but some 500 million internet users may never have a chance to try it out - those in China."
"Dave LeeNorth America technology reporter It is not the first time one of Google's famed self-driving cars has been involved in a crash, but it may be the first time it has caused one. Google is to meet with California's Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) to discuss the incident, and determine where the blame lies. On 14 February the car, travelling at 2mph (3km/h), pulled out in front of a public bus going 15mph (24km/h). The human in the Google vehicle reported that he assumed the bus would slow down to let the car out, and so he did not override the car's self-driving computer. The crash happened in Mountain View, near Google's headquarters. In a statement, Google said: ""We clearly bear some responsibility, because if our car hadn't moved, there wouldn't have been a collision. ""That said, our test driver believed the bus was going to slow or stop to allow us to merge into the traffic, and that there would be sufficient space to do that."" The company's self-driving cars have clocked up well over a million miles across various states in the US, and until now have only reported minor ""fender benders"" - the American slang for a small collision. In all of those cases, other road users were to blame. Google releases a monthly report detailing the testing of its self-driving technology. Ahead of the February report's publication, due Tuesday, a traffic incident filing was made public by the DMV. A setback ""The Google AV [autonomous vehicle] test driver saw the bus approaching in the left side mirror but believed the bus would stop or slow to allow the Google AV to continue,"" the report read. ""Approximately three seconds later, as the Google AV was re-entering the centre of the lane it made contact with the side of the bus. ""The Google AV was operating in autonomous mode and travelling at less than two mph, and the bus was travelling at about 15mph at the time of contact."" The car's movements were made more complex, the report said, by the presence of sandbags on the road. Google said it had now refined its self-driving algorithm. ""From now on, our cars will more deeply understand that buses (and other large vehicles) are less likely to yield to us than other types of vehicles, and we hope to handle situations like this more gracefully in the future."" If the DMV considers the Google car to be at fault for the collision, it could be seen as a setback for the company's ambitious autonomous vehicle plans. The bus crash came just four days after a legal breakthrough for the self-driving project - the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration told Google it would likely give the self-driving computer the same legal treatment as a human driver. That decision would pave the way for self-driving cars without any typical controls, such as a steering wheel or pedals.

"From 30 June, its AdWords and DoubleClick networks will no longer accept new ""display ads"" such as banners built in Flash. From January 2017 it will stop displaying Flash ads on websites - but some video ads built with Flash will still be accepted. Google said it wanted to ""encourage"" advertisers to switch to HTML5. Today, immersive websites and streaming video can be delivered using HTML5 - an open-source coding language that works across all modern web browsers and devices. Adobe Flash is a proprietary technology that can be added to web browsers to enable animations, interactivity and streaming video on websites. It was first released in 1996, at a time when the web was largely static. But the software has been plagued by security problems, and has been criticised for affecting computer performance and battery life. Flash failed to make a successful transition to mobile devices, so websites that rely on it do not work as intended on smartphones and tablets. Google's advertising networks AdWords and DoubleClick place promotional content on more than a million websites. The company said: ""We've rolled out tools to encourage advertisers to use HTML5, so you can reach the widest possible audience across screens."" In August, online shopping giant Amazon announced it would no longer accept Flash ads on its website. The BBC is currently working to move its video streaming service iPlayer away from Flash too. Adobe has developed its own HTML5 tools to help developers produce content that works across most modern devices. But the company said it would support Flash as long as customer demand remained. In November, it told the BBC: ""Until alternative technologies accommodate all our customers' needs, for example in delivery of HD video content on the desktop, we will continue to support Flash.""","Google is to banish most ads built in Adobe Flash from its advertising networks, the company has announced."
"By Leo KelionTechnology reporter The plan will allow owners to buy a ""name.uk"" web address to use instead of or in addition to ""name.co.uk"", ""name.org.uk"" and other alternatives. Nominet, the organisation responsible, had previously shelved the idea after acknowledging it would confuse people. But after making some changes and carrying out a second consultation it said it now planned to proceed. The decision will affect more than 10 million customers who currently use domains ending in .uk when it begins in the middle of next year. Nominet's French and German equivalents have already carried out a similar move. ""We think internet users are pretty savvy and will take this in their stride,"" Nominet's chief executive, Lesley Cowley, told the BBC. 'Low prices' Many businesses might feel compelled to purchase the new shorter addresses as well as continuing to run their existing ones in order to prevent others buying them to hijack traffic - something that will add to their running costs. But Ms Cowley played down the scale of the problem. She noted that the price it would charge to middlemen domain registrars would be £3.50 for single-year contracts and £2.50 a year for multi-year ones. The organisation had originally proposed charging £20 a year for the new addresses. ""Our wholesale prices are among the lowest in the world,"" she said. ""A Starbucks coffee is almost more expensive."" Ms Cowley added that during the most recent consultation, business leaders had been more concerned about the fact they would feel forced to fund address rebrands at a time that might not suit them. As a consequence Nominet has extended the amount of time its customers have to decide whether they want to pay for a shorter name before it will be offered to others. The original plan was to offer a six-month ""first dibs"" window, but the right-of-refusal period will now last up to five years. Competitive threat Nominet acknowledges there is still the ""theoretical risk"" of confusion among the general public. For example, people might become confused about which domain name to use in emails, leading some messages to be misdirected. However, it said this was a risk to any change in the internet's naming system. And it noted that another - potentially bigger - change was happening anyway. Icann (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) is in the process of creating about 1,400 new generic top-level domains (gTLDs). These include creating addresses ending in .camera, .singles and .london. There had previously been only 22, including .com and .net. Some of the new ones are in non-Latin scripts. Among those already approved are شبكة. - the Arabic equivalent of .web - and 游戏 - the Chinese for .game. Although Nominet is a non-profit organisation, it was worried that Icann's move meant it would lose business. ""Absent any credible competitive strategy, Nominet would be bound to lose significant market share in the future,"" the organisation said in a statement. ""We also note that the benefits of maintaining .uk relevance accrue not just to Nominet or its registrars but to all users of the .uk namespace who benefit from the high profile and positive perception of .uk."" One other change to the original plan is that applicants will no longer have to have a verified UK presence in order to qualify. This had initially been proposed to help ensure consumers had a ""high level of confidence"" in sites that had switched to the shorter name. However, fears that this would be too stringent mean the rule has been relaxed, and applicants will now only need to have a physical address in the country that the police or others can use to reach them.",UK websites will soon be able to use shorter addresses despite concerns the move could cause confusion.
"Dave LeeNorth America technology reporter Stacy Brown-Philpot is chief executive of TaskRabbit, an app where people can offer up their services for things like furniture building or help moving house. Like Uber and other gig economy sites, TaskRabbit Taskers - as they're known - are treated as contractors, not employees. The new law, AB5, could change that - and make firms responsible for offering things like holiday pay and sick leave. I spoke Stacy about the impact it might have on her business, and whether the gig economy is the future - though to be clear, our discussion occurred before the vote was passed a few days ago. I also asked her what it was like being one of Google's first black employees, and her difficult and risky decision to dramatically change TaskRabbit's business model after she took over the company in 2016, which angered many of its users. Anyway, as I arrived at TaskRabbit's HQ - which, as you'll hear, is next to an extremely busy road in San Francisco, one of TaskRabbit's' press team told me that Stacy often does some of the tasks for customers herself… so we started there. Interview transcript (edited for clarity) Dave Lee, BBC: What was the last task you did for a customer? Stacy Brown-Philpot, chief executive, TaskRabbit: The last task I did was an Ikea furniture assembly. As you know, our company was acquired by Ikea in October of 2017. And as a company we task, and so one of the Taskers in our community saw that I had done a task before that, and challenged me to do an Ikea task. So I showed up with another Tasker to do a task at a family who just moved to San Francisco. The mom is a professor, the dad was taking care of the kids. One of the kids was at preschool and the other one got out early. So the little daughter was with us while I was assembling a chair and two bookcases. Did that make things more difficult, having the small child, running around? You know, she was watching TV, and so we got to watch cartoons. And he ordered her a pizza. And he was the client was kind enough to share the pizza and the soda with us. So it actually made it quite fun. Did they know that you were going to be the Tasker before you showed up? Did they know that the boss was coming to do this? They did not. I don't ever say who I am. If they figure it out, that's fine. I don't say it. But at the end of the task, I did share it with him. And he was very surprised. I imagine people are always surprised, because it just seems like something that wouldn't be part of your day-to-day. It's a lot of work to go into an uncertain environment, to not know that a child is going to be there or what their room is going to look like and where this stuff is really going to go. The other Tasker who was with me was very experienced. So I was paired with somebody who knew his stuff and knew what he was doing, so much so that he let me borrow his power drill. When he saw I was moving a little slowly, he said: ""Why don't you try my power drill?"" And he gave it to me. So he knew all the pro-tips as well. So, even I learned something. Let's bring everything back to the beginning here. You were born in in Detroit at a time when the city was really starting to struggle. The auto industry was really beginning to not do well. And I think many people have a perception of what Detroit must have been like at that time. But I wonder what it was like specifically for you. For me growing up in Detroit was... it was home. And we had a community. And while the auto industry was starting to decline at that time, people still looked out for each other. There were lots of Midwestern values of having a strong work ethic, taking care of the other person in the community. Making sure that we all got something when somebody didn't have it. And those values I still carry with me today. I mean, one of TaskRabbit's values is around being a better neighbour. And that really goes back to community. And how we had a community that didn't have a lot of resources, but we still looked out for each other. One of your first jobs growing up was the same as my first job growing up, you did a paper round, and you did it with your brother, I understand... and this is precisely how I did mine. So I'm curious to know the differences between a paper round in England and a paper round in in Detroit. Tell me about that. What do you take from that? My brother was the CEO of the paper round. It was his idea to get one. And he enlisted me to help out. So I was the CFO, I was in charge of the money and collecting the money, and making sure that people paid and when they didn't pay, you know, showing up with either a sad face or an angry face to collect the money. But I remember my mom in the winters would drive us every few houses, because it was so cold you had to get in and warm up just a little bit to go deliver a few more papers. It was freezing. How did you get people to pay? What was your approach? You were strategic, because you knew what time people came home. So you would catch them on their way home from work. And when they're getting out of their car you're like: ""Hi, remember, you haven't paid for your paper round yet!"". And then they look at you, and they see your face. And they know that they owe you the money. So then they just they pay it, usually. They must have seen you coming and hid away. They tried, but I would sneak behind brushes or you know, whatever was necessary to make sure we got paid. I feel that this is one of those kind of cliché questions here. But from that paper round, are there ever times when you draw something from it in the job that you have at TaskRabbit? I draw something from everything that I've done. We're all a function of the experiences that we've had, and that one I really draw on. You know, it's all about relationships, and the people that we had the best relationships with were the people who, you know, paid us on time gave us extra tips, got us Christmas gifts, all of those things. And so I invest a lot in the relationships. TaskRabbit is built on relationships. And so I work at a company and have the joy of working at a company that's essentially built on relationships. We'll get to how you came to be at TaskRabbit in a moment. But what I was particularly interested was your time at Google, where, among other things, you were mentored by [now Facebook chief operating officer] Sheryl Sandberg. It sounds like a very close and useful mentorship. Tell me about that. How did you come to be in a position where you were in contact with Sheryl Sandberg and taking advice from her? I joined Google when it was about 1,000 people. It was shortly after Sheryl had joined from the federal government. So she, you know, was new to tech, as much as I was new to tech, and I just graduated from grad school. And I interviewed with 13 people on the day of my interview at Google. And she was my last interview. It was a walking interview. And it was 12 to 15 minutes. She was walking into an interview with the CEO at the time, Eric Schmidt. And she just asked me a bunch of questions about what motivated me, what excited me, why did I want the job and that was it. I wasn't sure if I got the job or not. So you did that walking along? The time she could give was going from one place to another? That's all she had. And so she obviously has a reputation of being capable of doing so much, and accomplishing so much. And there's no surprise that she was able to walk to her interview, be prepared for that, interview me and decide - because that night, it was decided that they would hire me to do the job. She's an amazing leader, and an amazing person. So I worked with her group in a finance role for a number of years before I moved over into her team into operations. And what really began as a, you know, work relationship spawned into a friendship that included mentorship. And she just saw potential in me that I didn't see in myself, and all of us have somebody in our lives who see us and see the potential for us to lead. She saw the potential for me to lead bigger teams, to really expand my thinking beyond finance and apply my analytical strengths to an operations role in a more strategic role. And so she brought me into a role into her team. And ever since has been the one who sort of pushed me to think bigger about what I can accomplish in my career. But also keep me honest about my own authenticity as a person. Do you speak to her now? Do you still check in from time to time and update each other on what's going on? We do as much as we can. Do you still draw advice from her? I do. I remember when I was promoted to CEO of TaskRabbit, and I sent an email to some friends saying: ""Hey, I got promoted."" She wrote back to me and said: ""All you have to do is do a good job."" That was her feedback. She said it doesn't matter what people say about you, just put your head down and do a good job and crush it. One of the things she encouraged you to do, I was reading, was form the Black Googler Network at Google. Yes. Tell me how that idea came about and how you became the person to run that. It was a very selfish effort to create the Black Googler Network. I was sitting in the company, I'd been there for a couple of years. And there just weren't a lot of people who looked like me. And so I just wanted to hire more people. I knew that we existed, the talent was there. But there was something about the company that wasn't.... it wasn't happening, they weren't naturally applying for the jobs or naturally getting them. What do you think was behind that? When you're fast-growing company, you're just trying to bring people in as fast as you can. And we've all experienced those phases of growth, that you often forget to pause and look around to check: ""How are we doing on inclusion? How are we doing on diversity?"" And so Sheryl had been a really big, important person who led a lot of women at Google. And so I went to her and I said I want to create this Black Googler Network. And she said: ""You're it. You're the person that you've been waiting for to do this."" I then went out and made it happen, we got budget, we started recruiting from historically black colleges and universities. We created an internship programme that encouraged all applicants to apply and was one of the most diverse internship programmes in tech at the time. And created a way for the community to come together, which is what I really wanted, we started to have events, we started to talk about our culture more broadly. And we started to build connections, which I think helped a lot of us stay at Google longer than we might that we might have otherwise. Aside from employee retention, what else do you think that brings to Google as a company? Perspective. Thinking about the ""other"" and the perspective of the ""other"", really forces you to step out of everything that you do every day. And so I believe the company builds better products, because we have more diversity in the team. I believe that how you approach decision making. It might not be the fastest way to get to that decision, but it's the best way to get to that decision because you have all voices heard. One of the things you've described in the past is how your hair was such an important part of changing how you felt to be at Google. Explain that journey to me. We all have unconscious bias. Everybody, whether you're in a majority group, or in a minority group, and how you wear your hair is one of them. You may unconsciously think that just because someone wears their hair curly, they're not as serious. We were taught that if your hair was straight, you conformed to a certain norm. And you did it, because there were already so many other things about me that were different. I wasn't an engineer, I was a woman. I was African-American. So as a minority, you try to like simplify all of the differences in order to minimise the unconscious bias. And so that's how the hair came into it. So you had your hair straight... I had my hair straight. And then I decided to not wear straight anymore. So I had to cut it all off and do something called ""twists"" that eventually grew out, and now I wear locks. And I was very nervous about how people were going went to receive me. Were they going to treat me differently, because I was wearing my hair different? What questions were they going to have about it? And I got to work the next day and everyone's like: ""Hi Stacy. How are you?"" So a lot of it was me. And a lot of it was, you know, an assumption that you make about a person or what someone else might think. And now I fully embrace who I am. What you see is what you get. And I love that. I feel like I have more energy because of that. But it hasn't always been true, especially early in my career. One of the things that Google is going through right now, it's this internal activism about various issues. Do you look back at the company and think it's moved on from the time that you were there? Or do you sort of see different kind of challenges that they're going through right now? Well, the challenges at 1,000 are different than 70,000. I think that might be how many people they have now. The importance of hearing all voices is still the same. And the rise in activism has always been a part of the culture at Google. They had a company meeting every Friday before the company went public, and we would share everything. And then we went public and they stopped sharing everything. But it created an openness, a transparency and expectation and people will get up there and ask any question that they wanted. So it's not surprising to me that the nature of the questions, the level of the questions are absolutely still there. And they've escalated because the seriousness of the issues, if you look at what's going on in our society, have escalated. I think it's admirable that they have created the space for people to share their voice, and are doing their best, I believe, to encourage all of the voices to be heard. Why do you think it's spilled out into the public? The size of Google is such it impacts everything that we do every day. So the responsibilities are greater for what the company is expected to achieve. And we, as citizens who use this service, and depend on this service, have an expectation of leadership, an expectation of responsibility. And I think employees who work there carry that with them. And I think that's why. So you left Google, you left a very good position at Google. What was the point you decided ""I've got move on""? It is hard to leave. There's free food every day. All the companies do that now. It was fun. And I worked with amazing people, Sheryl included, but so many amazing people. I had great responsibilities, I had a corner office with floor-to-ceiling windows on two walls. My dog came to work with me every day and I had a great assistant. There was nothing imperfect about that. But I was feeling called to do something different. And it was really a desire to build something, to create something new. And all of us who started something or joined something very early on, get this itch to do that. And so it wasn't about leaving Google. It was about going to something else. And I had fulfilled so many dreams at Google, so many. I lived in India, I worked in finance, I'd worked in sales, I'd worked a lot of functions. I've done so many things. And now my next calling was just something different. One of the things that's happened in your tenure is the nature of TaskRabbit works changed quite fundamentally. Describe that to people who aren't familiar with both of those models. Describe what it was and then and then what it became. The original version of TaskRabbit was like an auction, where you would go in and say: ""I need my house cleaned tomorrow. And a lot of people would come in and bid on that cleaning. Or someone would go in and say: ""I want this TV mounted on the wall next week."" And people will come in and bid. And you as the person who posted it could pick the highest bidder, the lowest bidder, you could decide who you wanted. And so the auction was great, because you could see the best price, but they may not be available on the [right] day, they may not be available tomorrow, or next week. Or the person with the best price may not have all of the skills that you want. And Taskers were frustrated because they weren't finding the work that they wanted. They had to keep checking back often, to see if there was work for them. Which meant we had about a 50% chance that you get your job done on TaskRabbit, like a coin toss. The people who were happy, were super-happy. And the people who were mad were angry. So we changed the model. And we actually piloted it in London. And we wanted to go somewhere different where people didn't know yet about the current model, and just tested in one of our most requested markets, which was London at the time. So you had no business in London, at that point, so you launched it with the new method in London. We called it a direct-hire model. The Taskers went in, they set their own hourly rates. We set a floor, which is the highest minimum wage in the country, so that they couldn't under-price themselves. And they set their own hourly rates, they set their hours, their calendar, their availability. And then they got to select what categories they wanted to provide services around and tell us about their skills. So when you show up as a client, you only see people who are available at the time that you want, with the skills, and you know exactly how much it's going to cost. And that increased our fulfilment rate, which is a metric that we use to really indicate the success of the model, to more than 90%. Wow. So from the 50% before, to 90. After that successful pilot, you then have to change the system for everyone. And that was a particularly difficult moment, your Taskers in the US weren't happy about that. We were excited to just roll out this model everywhere. And we knew that those metrics were possible, because we saw them in another city in another country. When we brought it back to the US, it was a change. And we had built a community of Taskers who depended on TaskRabbit for their income, they depended on us to pay major bills every month. And to not know if the big change that we were making was actually going to give them the $300 or $500 that they needed this month was scary. So they were mad, because we didn't tell them as much about it as we probably should have. But more importantly, they wanted to stay a part of the community that was going to provide a meaningful income. And the only way that we could show them that that was what was going to happen is to make the product change. They didn't care if it worked in London, they didn't live in London, they'd never been in London, they didn't care where that was. They just wanted to know if it would work in Chicago, in Boston, in LA, in San Francisco, in DC, where they lived right now. It was a rough period navigating through that because we underestimated how powerful the community was, and their voice was. We now have a Tasker advisory council. There's Taskers here all the time at our corporate headquarters talking about their experience. We know exactly what's going on in the community. You mentioned the sale to Ikea, which seems an obvious partner given given that many of your Taskers build furniture. But why a sale as opposed to doing what some of the other gig economy companies are doing and having a big splashy IPO that makes everyone billionaires? Why did a sale to Ikea make sense? It came down to values. I became the CEO in April of 2016. And then we sold the company a year-and-a-half later. And that was not my intent. My vision was to bring TaskRabbit everywhere. At that point, we were just in the US and the UK. We had launched some more cities, but there was so much more we were doing to increase our engagement and usage and just spread this business around the world. We had a meeting with the Ikea team. They visited several Silicon Valley companies. And the meeting really highlighted for me, wow, this is an amazing company. They have great values. Ikea's mission is to create a better everyday life for the many people. Ours is to make everyday life easier for everyday people. Their's was written 75 years ago. Ours 10 years ago. It's just - there was so much alignment there. We were also meeting a huge pain point - the number of furniture assemblies we were doing from Ikea was astounding to them. Not astounding to us, but astounding to them. You said recently that you feel like the gig economy is the future of work. That feels slightly terrifying to me, that small jobs, done on a very much ad hoc basis, might be the future of how people all make their living. What do you what do you mean, when you say the gig economy is going to be the future of work? It's flexibility, which is the future of work. And it's not just because it's a gig and it's a short gig, you obviously can have flexibility and work at the same company every day for, you know, for 10 years. But really, when I when I put myself in the shoes of our Taskers, it really is the flexibility that is the future of work. There's a Tasker who I see, I've seen her a couple of times here, who has a college degree, had a great job. But because of life and things happening, she needed flexibility - pick her kid up from school, drop them off - to be available in the middle of the day. That was not an option for her at her other job. But is the gig economy the solution to that? It is a solution. It is what is working for her. I'm really challenging her advice to me right now, which was: ""There are going to be days when you wake up, and people say what you're doing is actually not good for us. And I want you to know that it's good for me."" And so it's what works for her. And so who are we, the collective we, to say this is not the right future of work or not the way the future should go. This is a way. There are plenty of other ways. And I invite a dialogue on what those other ways may be, that helps people earn a meaningful income, that gives them the flexibility, that provides the security that they need to feel confident that they could grow their professional lives and build a family at the same time. What are those other ideas? Let's talk about them. One idea particularly here in California is this distinction between contractors and employees. I wonder what impact it would have on TaskRabbit if, legally, you had to start making people employees instead of contractors. Could the company even handle that? This is very new. We believe we can build a sustainable business, because we have a community of people who are totally dependent on what we're doing. So I like to believe that we can find a way that meets whatever regulations have been imposed on us, and then still allows for our platform to exist. So that if you want to work as an independent contractor or want to work in a flexible way, you can do that. How many Taskers do you have? We've got over 60,000 Taskers in our community. So if they suddenly had to be employees, you'd have to pay for healthcare, holiday pay, and all those other things that get wrapped up when someone becomes an employee. Will the company be able operate that way? Because that's such a big expense that you just don't have now. It sounds so daunting. But we're not sitting here saying, well, we should just give up. Right? What we're saying is like, wow, that's potentially daunting. Let's think about how we can make that happen. Because we've got 60,000 registered people who need to make it work. So it wouldn't be it wouldn't be the end of the world, is what you're saying? It can't be the end of the world. There are plenty of things that can end the world. A law in the state of California cannot be it. We look at companies like Uber, when they IPO and they have to lay out their financials. It just looks incredibly unlikely they can turn those numbers around. And if this employee stipulation is added on top, the gig economy can only really exist because you don't have to have workers as employees. I don't know enough about Uber's strategy to know how their [profit and loss] is structured and why it is that way. What I do know is we are focused on building a sustainable business. We're owned by a privately-held company that has been around for 75 years as a privately-held company and has sustained their growth because they've been able to achieve profitable growth. So I believe we've got the best minds thinking about this. What are those minds doing next? What's what was coming down the line for TaskRabbit? My vision is to bring TaskRabbit everywhere. We've been lucky to announce to launch Canada last year, France this year, and there'll be more geographic expansion to come. Finally, I'm curious to know... there must be some very strange tasks that people have requested over the years. What are some of the things that stick out for you? There's been some fun things like testers impersonating best friends for birthday parties. I heard this! This is someone that pretended to be someone's friend because the friend couldn't make it. The friend couldn't make it to the party. So she hired a Tasker to impersonate her. And the Tasker shows up, looks nothing like the friend, but has all of the facts from childhood and you know, everything and just... is the friend at the party. It was in LA, of course... obviously. The best friend figured out: ""Oh, you sent.... this is my gift, which is like you, but not you!"" _____ Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC Do you have more information about this or any other technology story?

"Google engineers created 100 nonsensical queries such as ""hiybbprqag"" and inserted a fake result for each. Within weeks, the same results began to appear on its rival Microsoft's Bing search engine. Microsoft denies copying Google and accused Google of conducting ""spy-novelesque stunts"". Harry Shum, vice president of Bing, said: ""We do not copy Google's search results. We use multiple signals and approaches in ranking search results,"" he added. ""Opt-in programs like the toolbar help us with clickstream data, one of many input signals we and other search engines use to help rank sites,"" he added. Cheap imitation But Google's Amit Singhal told industry blog SearchEngineLand.com that it was ""plain and simply cheating"" and he detailed the sting operation in a long blog post. He said Google decided to conduct its experiment after mis-spelt words and results were replicated on Bing. ""A search for 'hiybbprqug' on Bing returned a page about seating at a theatre in Los Angeles. As far as we know the only connection between the query and result is Google's result page,"" he said. ""We noticed that URLs from Google search results would later appear in Bing with increasing frequency,"" he went on. He concluded that Microsoft was gathering data on what people search for on Google, via either Internet Explorer or the Bing Search toolbar. ""Some Bing results increasingly look like an incomplete, stale version of Google results - a cheap imitation,"" he said. Search voice Danny Sullivan, a search engine expert, has mixed feelings about what the experiment shows. ""On the one hand you could say it's incredibly clever. Why not mine what people are selecting as the top results on Google as a signal?"" he wrote on his blog. But he also said he had sympathy for Google's view that Bing is doing something wrong. ""Every search engine has its own 'search voice', a unique set of search results that it provides, based on its collection of documents and its own particular method of ranking those. I think Bing should develop its own search voice without using Google's as a tuning fork,"" he added. Wider issues for him include how Google went about setting up its honeypot trap to ensnare Bing and whether it was just a ""clever way to distract from current discussions about its search quality"". Google has stressed that it has now removed the one-time code that it added to plant the fake pages. Had any of its fake queries proved popular, it said that it would have removed the page they linked to. Mr Sullivan also questioned how much consumers knew about the data capture that allowed Microsoft to gather Google's search results, either via Internet Explorer or the Bing toolbar. ""Do Internet Explorer users know that they might be helping Bing in the way Google alleges? Technically, yes. Explicitly, absolutely not,"" he said.","Google has accused Microsoft of cheating, following an investigation known as the 'Bing Sting'."
"The 10-year contract for the Joint Enterprise Defence Infrastructure, or Jedi, is aimed at making the US defence department more technologically agile. Amazon's bid drew criticism from its rivals and US President Donald Trump. The company said it was ""surprised"" by the decision. A ""detailed assessment purely on the comparative offerings"" would ""clearly lead to a different conclusion"", it said. Amazon is said to be evaluating its options after the decision. It has 10 days to decide whether or not to launch a challenge. In its statement, the Pentagon said all offers ""were treated fairly"". Microsoft executive Toni Townes-Whitley said the company was ""proud"" to have had its cloud technologies picked by the Department of Defense to ""satisfy the urgent and critical needs of today's warfighters"". What is Jedi? The Department of Defense wants to replace its ageing computer networks with a single cloud system. Under the contract, Microsoft will provide artificial intelligence-based analysis and host classified military secrets among other services. It is hoped that Jedi will give the military better access to data and the cloud from battlefields. Is the decision controversial? Amazon had been considered the front-runner - until President Trump began questioning whether the process was fair. In July he told reporters that he was getting ""tremendous complaints about the contract with the Pentagon and Amazon"". He said other companies had told him that the contract ""wasn't competitively bid"" and that his administration would ""take a very long look"" at the process. Mr Trump has repeatedly criticised Amazon and its founder Jeff Bezos - who also owns the Washington Post newspaper - in the past. Dan Ives, managing director and equity analyst Wedbush Securities, said he expected Amazon and others to challenge the decision in the courts, but called it a ""paradigm changer"" for Microsoft. The move was likely to boost Microsoft's share price and bring ""significant positive financial implications"" for the company in the coming years, he said. A blow for Amazon By Leo Kelion, BBC Technology desk editor Amazon will be bitterly disappointed to have lost this contract, having long considered its bid to be the stronger. But after President Trump's comments about ""receiving tremendous complaints"" about Amazon's frontrunner status in July, and then the delay to announcing the award the following month, it had always looked liked Microsoft could pull off an upset. The timing is curious, however, coming just days after Defence Secretary Mark Esper unexpectedly removed himself from the review process after months of involvement, on the grounds that one of his sons worked for IBM - one of the other original applicants. It means Microsoft is now set to be a huge recipient of Department of Defense funds. Not only will it benefit from Jedi, but also a separate multi-billion dollar contract known as Deos. This has run into delays of its own, but is still set to result in the DoD using cloud-based Office 365 for its email, calendar, video-calling and other productivity software needs. One issue for Microsoft is whether its closeness to the military will cause it problems. Some of its own workers have already objected to it developing a version of its Hololens augmented reality headset for the US military, and the idea of it now providing machine learning tools and other systems to help ""enhance force lethality"" could prove to be a PR nightmare. For Amazon, if the loss of such a lucrative contract is linked to Jeff Bezos's ownership of the Washington Post, it could fuel calls for AWS to be spun off from its parent and established as a separate company. There had already been speculation this might happen in order to head off regulators' concerns that Amazon already extends too deeply into Americans' lives. How did we get here? The announcement marked the end of a long process that had pitted tech giants Microsoft, Amazon, Oracle and IBM against each other. As the world's biggest provider of cloud-computing services, Amazon had been the favourite to win Jedi. But its competitors argued that the process was unfair. Oracle challenged the bidding process in federal court earlier this year, saying that it was rigged to favour Amazon, but a federal judge dismissed the allegation. What else does the Pentagon say? It said that it had awarded more than $11bn in 10 separate cloud-computing contracts over the past two years. The Jedi deal ""continues our strategy of a multi-vendor, multi-cloud environment as the department's needs are diverse and cannot be met by any single supplier,"" it added.","The Pentagon has awarded a $10bn (£8bn) cloud-computing contract to Microsoft, following a heavily scrutinised bidding process in which Amazon had been seen as the favourite."
"The Facebook-owned app, which has two billion users worldwide, said the setting would help keep chats private. But it said recipients would still be able to screenshot or forward any messages, photos or videos that they wanted to keep. The option will appear for WhatsApp users by the end of November. In a blog, the company said messages could be set to expire after seven days to offer ""peace of mind that conversations aren't permanent, while remaining practical so you don't forget what you were chatting about"". In April 2019, Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg pledged to make several changes to the social network to offer users more privacy. One of his proposed changes was offering more ""ephemeral"" ways to share content, including disappearing messages. The company also hopes to integrate its messaging platforms, making WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook Messenger interoperable. Rival messaging app Snapchat, which has provided inspiration for a number of Facebook's features, was built on the principle of disappearing messages. ""Remarkable that this was so long in coming to WhatsApp, given that it launched Status (also a disappearing feature) back in 2017, that ephemeral is huge, and that this is Facebook we are talking about,"" said Ingrid Lunden, a journalist for Tech Crunch, on Twitter.","WhatsApp is introducing a ""disappearing messages"" option that will erase chats from the phone of both the sender and recipient after seven days."
"Clearview has already amassed more than three billion photographs from sites including Facebook and Twitter. They are used by the FBI and Department of Homeland Security and more than 600 other law-enforcement agencies around the world to identify suspects. In a cease-and-desist letter sent on Tuesday, Twitter said its policies had been violated and requested the deletion of any collected data. Twitter's developer agreement policy says: ""Information derived from Twitter content may not be used by, or knowingly displayed, distributed, or otherwise made available to any public-sector entity for surveillance purposes."" According to the New York Times, the Clearview app includes programming that could pair the images with augmented-reality glasses that would allow users to identify the names and addresses of anyone they saw. Clearview has not yet responded to a request for comment. 'Dangerous behaviours' US senator Ron Wyden said on Twitter Clearview's activities were ""extremely troubling"". ""Americans have a right to know whether their personal photos are secretly being sucked into a private facial-recognition database,"" he said. ""Every day, we witness a growing need for strong federal laws to protect privacy."" Senator Edward J Markey also shared his concerns, in a letter sent to the company on Wednesday, suggesting its technology could ""facilitate dangerous behaviours and effectively destroy individuals' ability to go about their lives anonymously"". It follows suggestions the European Commission is considering a five-year ban on the use of facial recognition in public areas. Regulators want time to work out how to prevent the technology being abused. Concerns over the use of facial-recognition technology have grown recently, even in China, where the government continues to embrace its uses. Some 74% of Chinese respondents in a recent survey by the Beijing research institute said they wanted the option to be able to use traditional ID methods over the tech to verify their identity.",Twitter has demanded an AI company stop taking images from its website.
"By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor While some have welcomed Robert Hannigan's call for a ""public debate about privacy"", there is suspicion from others that his article foreshadows the government extending his agency's surveillance powers whatever the outcome of the suggested discussions. Below are a selection of the reactions posted online by the media, privacy campaigners and public: Newspapers and blogs: The Guardian: The message may prove a winner to many people who hear it, who share the view that further powers are needed to tackle the extremist threats faced by the UK at home and abroad. But to those who in the aftermath of the surveillance revelations of the past year hoped for serious engagement and debate, there seemed little to clutch to in this. Hannigan may be thumping the table harder than his predecessors, but the content of his message remains almost entirely the same. Register: The fact that Hannigan has spent his first day firing off a public-relations broadside on this issue shows quite how worried the security services are about the proliferation of communications they can't easily tap... While backdoors might keep the spies happy, sales of devices and cloud services would plummet should word get out that US tech giants were willing partners in mass surveillance. ZDNet: Privacy is a right, Europe says, and there's no getting out of it... In the game of government to Silicon Valley cat-and-mouse, the mice are ahead of their predators. And while GCHQ's Hannigan has a right to debate, he doesn't have a right to complain. Channel 4 blog: It's great to hear that Hannigan wants GCHQ to ""enter the public debate"" on the issue. In public is precisely the place where these matters should be decided: not in the secrecy of the Cheltenham doughnut, nor the obscurity of Silicon Valley's boardrooms. Daily Telegraph: The same tools used by extremists are free to the rest of us too. That gives all of us both the opportunity and responsibility to defend what it is we believe... The battle for ideas online can't be won, or even fought, by governments. It's down to us. Diginomica: There is still just public anger at the way that governments were monitoring web activity and there is still a significant lack of trust within the tech community - the response has been to lock down as much as possible. However, I am not convinced that Hannigan's piece is being received as it was intended - I don't see how a person asking for an open dialogue is asking for a fight. Betanews: It's one thing to be opposed to the likes of [Islamic State], it's quite another to be amenable to having one's entire communication snooped into. GCHQ's sudden decision to enter the privacy debate is interesting, but it's not clear that it will actually amount to anything. Breitbart: Spy agencies are right to be frustrated by the lack of co-operation from Google, Facebook and others... It seems to me that this will require legislation to correct, since the companies concerned have proven themselves incapable of acting sensibly of their own volition, and of listening to their own customers, the majority of whom, if asked, would surely be appalled that their family photos and private messages are sharing a platform with people who want to destroy our way of life. Campaign groups: Jim Killock, Open Rights Group: It should be down to judges, not GCHQ nor tech companies, to decide when our personal data is handed over to the intelligence services. If Hannigan wants a ""mature debate"" about privacy, he should start by addressing GCHQ's apparent habit of gathering the entire British population's data rather than targeting their activities towards criminals. Shami Chakrabarti, Liberty: Mr Hannigan shouldn't grab the megaphone whilst wearing the headphones or use threats and smears that ignore due process and the rule of law. Rather than trashing our best traditions for convenience, the UK should lead the way on improving lawful access to data between states in the fight against terrorism. Eric King, Privacy International: It's disappointing to see GCHQ's new director refer to the internet - the greatest tool for innovation, access to education and communication humankind has ever known - as a command-and-control network for terrorists... Robert Hannigan is right, GCHQ does need to enter the public debate about privacy - but attacking the internet isn't the right way to do it. Twitter: GCHQ Dir says some painful truths @20committee (John Schindler, author and former National Security Agency (NSA) analyst) ""Privacy never an absolute right"" in spook, translates as ""state shall be able to invade privacy if convenient, without particular reason"" @CasparBowden (security researcher and privacy rights campaigner) I wouldn't mind betting the discussion turns into banning encryption or handing over keys. What have you got to hide, plebs? @rossmasters (software developer) No terrorist or criminal worth their salt is going to use Facebook or Twitter for comms. Propaganda yes, comms no. #GCHQ @jerryhat Sadly, despite suggesting they're up for a debate on privacy, head of GCHQ unavailable for interview. @tomcheshiresky (Sky News technology correspondent) To be fair Robert Hannigan is right to say GCHQ needs to enter public debate about privacy, and to show how it's accountable... There are things that make me uneasy in his op-ed, but this debate has to engage somewhere. @williamheath (chairman of personal data specialists Mydex) Anything ""hackable"" by #GCHQ will be ""hackable"" by criminals. #Security services destroyed any #trust they had with mass data collection @PraxisReform Reddit: It's kind of ironic that governments which support mass surveillance and the breach of their citizens' privacy are the ones which will respond the most violently when their secrets are probed or revealed. Akesgeroth He's not entirely wrong. Privacy is not an absolute right in Britain. The fourth amendment of the US Constitution was written with the government of the UK in mind. Yeeeuup This move by GCHQ and the FBI to move technology backwards is pointless. The best analogy would be the Church's attempt to make crossbows illegal, because they had a disturbing tendency to undermine the idea that God would appoint the victor of armed combat. loteknick One thing is true: This is best served as a public debate. bull_god Why should we all be subjected to mass surveillance? This to me is being treated as guilty for using the internet because of a few morons in society. Privacy tools (Tor, Tails etc) exist because there is powers out there that abuse their privileged positions. Maybe if GCHQ, NSA weren't such abusive agencies then less people would use privacy tools in the first place. dan_devs_uk There should be a mature discussion for this, we need a middle ground where people's right to privacy is protected, but there should be a transparent framework in place for security agencies to do their jobs too. ktechmidas Terrorists have been using strong encryption for years. It's worrying that as soon as the general public start using it, GCHQ throws their toys out of the pram. sonicated","An article by British spy agency GCHQ's new director, which suggests leading tech firms have become ""command-and-control networks of choice for terrorists"" and that they need to do more to facilitate investigations, has sparked debate online."
"By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter ""I test my own technology - with all of them being called Alexa, I see which one is waking up and whether it is the right device,"" says the chief scientist of the AI division responsible for the tech. That's a lot of Alexa. But, it seems, still not enough. In a one-on-one interview with the BBC, Mr Prasad discussed plans for Alexa to both become smarter and to follow users wherever they go. This is known in the trade as ubiquitous ambient computing, and Amazon hopes to corner the market. In the US, it already sells an Echo system that plays Alexa through a car's speakers. And Mr Prasad says he also wants the virtual assistant to accompany users as they walk about too. To achieve this, he explains, the tech needs to get better at contextual reasoning. ""If you are in a store and you say, 'Where are the tomatoes?' it will need to have the context,"" he says. ""You are actually looking for the aisle so it may need a store map. ""Or if you are in a hotel room and you ask for the swimming pool hours, it should give you the hours for the hotel and not the community pool."" To pursue this goal, the firm recently launched its own Alexa-enabled earbuds and is testing other wearables including glasses and even a ring with select customers. The more users Alexa attracts and the more time they spend chatting to it, the more data Mr Prasad's team and the training algorithms involved can draw on to make improvements. There are, he says ""hundreds of millions"" of devices worldwide already taking billions of requests each week from customers. He adds that Alexa now offers 100,000-plus skills - its version of apps - and can communicate with other smart products from more than 9,500 brands. And it seems Amazon is getting the upper hand. According to market research firm Canalys, Amazon's smart speakers outsold Google's by nearly three-to-one worldwide in the last quarter. Moreover, it said Amazon's sales were still accelerating while Google's had slumped. Gender choice Google, of course, benefits from the fact that its assistant is baked into Android, meaning handset owners are already using it across their daily lives. But in the contest to offer the smartest smart assistant, Mr Prasad says Alexa is evolving at a rapid pace. ""All of these components have become smarter by four times in terms of what our error rate was in 2014 to now,"" he says. The figure, he says, is based on accurate handling of four common tasks: Amazon is about to let users buy alternative celebrity voices for Alexa, starting with that of the actor Samuel L Jackson. But will it ever give users the choice of having a default voice that isn't female? In other words, letting owners chat to Alex rather than Alexa? Gender-neutral AI is, Mr Prasad says, a ""very hot topic"". ""This is a debate we have every few months. It is not just about gender, but about Alexa's voice and choice of words,"" he adds. ""We wanted a personality that was very relatable to our customers."" ""If we felt that there has to be another gender for Alexa, well we'd also have to think what would the wake word be, because its personality and gender all sort of go together and you have to think about overall personality, not just gender."" Testing trust Despite all the work that's been done on Alexa, tales of ""fails"" persist. Amazon had to act to curb a spontaneous creepy laugh reported by users last year, while reports persist of it struggling with some accents. According to Martin Garner, an analyst at research firm CCS Insight, Alexa's capabilities may have ""moved on a lot over the last two years... but smart assistant voice services have the effect of raising people's expectations very rapidly too"". ""All providers are racing as fast as possible to extend the range of questions they can answer,"" he added. Users also need to feel they can trust Amazon if they are to surround themselves with its microphones. And that confidence was recently challenged after revelations that the firm was using third-party contractors working from home to listen back and label recordings. Amazon has since made it easier to opt out of the process, but Mr Prasad says it has no plans to drop human-based checks. ""Supervised learning is a key aspect, where humans label a very small fraction - actually less than 1% - of the data that goes though Alexa,"" he said. ""We are making it much easier to delete but also by bringing the convenience of voice. You can say, 'Alexa tell me what you heard,' and if you're uncomfortable with what is was, you can delete it."" But some have questioned this ""easy option"", pointing out that in order to exclude themselves users have to locate a setting buried several menus deep on the Alexa app and Amazon's website. New etiquette? Even if many consumers make an active choice to have Alexa in their lives, others may be unhappy at having their voices picked up. Last month, Google's devices chief Rick Osterloh told the BBC that he informs guests to his home that smart speakers are in use before they enter. But Mr Prasad says he does not believe there's a need for such etiquette to become widespread. ""It's very important to realise that the devices don't listen for anything but Alexa, the wake word,"" he says. ""We have to be clear about that in terms of what detection means. ""You can mute the button on the device. And Alexa is quite transparent when it is streaming to the cloud because the blue lights come on."" Even so, as Alexa is added to more devices and becomes more omnipresent there's a question about how obvious this will always be.",Rohit Prasad has 17 smart speakers in his home powered by Amazon's smart assistant.
"The company has been told to delete all the data it had gathered on people who did not use Facebook. The court ruled the data was gathered illegally. Belgium's privacy watchdog said the website had broken privacy laws by placing tracking code - known as cookies - on third-party websites. Facebook said it would appeal against the ruling. The social network faces fines of 250,000 euros (£221,000, $311,000) a day if it does not comply. The court said Facebook must ""stop following and recording internet use by people surfing in Belgium, until it complies with Belgian privacy laws"". ""Facebook must also destroy all personal data obtained illegally."" The ruling is the latest in a long-running dispute between the social network and the Belgian commission for the protection of privacy (CPP). In 2015, the CPP complained that Facebook tracked people when they visited pages on the site or clicked ""like"" or ""share"", even if they were not members. It won its case, but Facebook had the verdict overturned in 2016. Now the court has again agreed with the findings of the CPP. Facebook said it was ""disappointed"" by the verdict. Richard Allan, the company's vice-president of public policy in Europe, said: ""The cookies and pixels we use are industry standard technologies, and enable hundreds of thousands of businesses to grow their businesses and reach customers across the EU.""","Facebook has been ordered to stop tracking people without consent, by a court in Belgium."
"By Leo KelionTechnology reporter NTT Docomo - the country's biggest mobile network - will initially convert Japanese to English, Mandarin and Korean, with other languages to follow. It is the latest in a series of telephone conversation translators to launch in recent months. Lexifone and Vocre have developed other products. Alcatel-Lucent and Microsoft are among those working on other solutions. The products have the potential to let companies avoid having to use specially trained multilingual staff, helping them cut costs. They could also aid tourism. However, the software involved cannot offer perfect translations, limiting its use in some situations. Cloud technology NTT Docomo unveiled its Hanashite Hon'yaku app for Android devices at the Combined Exhibition of Advanced Technologies (Ceatec) show in Japan earlier this month, and plans to launch it on 1 November. It provides users with voice translations of the other speaker's conversation after a slight pause, as well as providing a text readout. ""French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish and Thai will be added for this application in late November, raising the number of non-Japanese languages to 10,"" the firm said in a statement. ""Fast and accurate translations are possible with any smartphone, regardless of device specifications, because Hanashite Hon'yaku utilises Docomo's cloud [remote computer servers] for processing."" The caller must subscribe to one of Docomo's packages to be able to use it. Landline translations NTT Docomo will soon face competition from France's Alcatel-Lucent which is developing a rival product, WeTalk. It can handle Japanese and about a dozen other languages including English, French and Arabic. The service is designed to work over any landline telephone, meaning the company has had to find a way to do speech recognition using audio data sampled at a rate of 8kHz or 16kHz. Other products - which rely on data connections - have used higher 44kHz samples which are easier to process. Alcatel-Lucent uses a patented technology to capture the user's voice and enhance it before applying speech recognition software. The data is then run through translation software before being run through a speech synthesiser. The firm said all this could be done in less than a second. However, it has opted to wait before the speaker has stopped talking before starting the translation after experiments carried out with workers at insurance company Axa suggested users preferred the experience. ""We are still working on improving the system,"" Gilles Gerlinger, the product's co-founder, told the BBC. ""You can do conversations with one person, but we want to allow conferences with 10 people and four different languages, and the system would provide translations in every language needed. ""We also have a project called MyVoice which can have a synthetic voice that sounds like your real one."" Mr Gerlinger suggested that his firm would make money from the product by renting servers with the necessary software to big businesses, and charging smaller ones a fee for the amount of time they used the service. Converted video chats Microsoft's Research Labs has also been working on a technology it calls the Translating Telephone. The firm has acknowledged that one of the biggest problems was making the software adapt itself to cope with different ways people pronounce words. ""The technologies are still not perfect,"" said researcher Kit Thambiratnam in 2010. ""But we feel they are good enough for two people to communicate in their native languages, as long as they are willing to speak carefully and maybe occasionally repeat themselves."" Google already has a Translate app that can translate 17 spoken languages, allowing face-to-face conversations with a foreigner, but it is not yet designed to work with telephone calls. Start-up Israeli company Lexifone is hoping to get a head-start with its own phone conversation product. It launched earlier this year offering translations between English, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, French and Mandarin. Its chief executive, an ex-IBM computer engineer, has ambitions to disrupt the human translation industry which he said was worth $14bn (£8.7bn) a year. ""Our original plan was for annual growth of 200%,"" Ike Sagie told Reuters last month. ""The way we see market acceptance and the way we see the market welcoming the technology I think we have the potential for growing faster than that."" The firm is working with BT and Telefonica to offer its service to the phone networks' customers. Meanwhile California-based MyLanguage, is pursuing another strategy by providing voice and text translations during video chats via its Vocre app for iPhones. The facility - which is currently being beta tested - means that customers will need an internet connection to use it. Lost in translation Despite the ambitions of those involved in the nascent sector, one analyst questioned their chances of success ""These kind of real-time technologies have been 'two to three years away' for the past decade,"" said Benedict Evans, technology expert at Enders Analysis. ""Both speech recognition and machine translation are sort of there if you're not too fussy. ""But they are generally not as good as speaking the language itself, and my suspicion is that they would not reliable enough to use them for business purposes when you need to be really sure about what the other person said.""",An app offering real-time translations is to allow people in Japan to speak to foreigners over the phone with both parties using their native tongue.
"The bug meant email and telephone numbers were accidentally shared with people who would not otherwise have had access to the information. So far, there was no evidence the data exposed was being exploited for malicious ends, said Facebook. It said it was ""upset and embarrassed"" by the bug, which was found by a programmer outside the company. Bug bounty The data exposure came about because of the way that Facebook handled contact lists and address books uploaded to the social network, it said in a security advisory. Typically, it said, it analysed the names and contact details on those lists so it could make friend recommendations and put people in touch with those they knew. The bug meant some of the information Facebook generated during that checking process was stored alongside the uploaded contact lists and address books. That meant, said Facebook, that when someone had downloaded their profile this extra data had travelled with it, letting people see contact details that had not been explicitly shared with them. An investigation into the bug showed that contact details for about six million people were inadvertently shared in this way. Despite this, Facebook said the ""practical impact"" had been small because information was most likely to have been shared with people who already knew the affected individuals. The bug had now been fixed, it added. Facebook was alerted to the bug by a member of its ""White Hat"" program who checks the site's code for glitches and other loopholes. A bounty for the bug has been paid to the programmer who found it. Security analyst Graham Cluley criticised Facebook's release of the information just before the weekend and said the disclosure had been more about ""damage limitation"" than making sure the information reached as wide an audience as possible.",Personal details of about six million people have been inadvertently exposed by a bug in Facebook's data archive.
"By Cristina CriddleTechnology reporter Owners have listed homes as being ""Covid-19 retreats"" and ""perfect for isolating with family"" in the British countryside. New coronavirus laws say holiday accommodation should be provided only to keyworkers needing to self-isolate. But some listings on the site allow instant booking of rentals without any vetting, BBC News discovered. The properties advertised as places to self-isolate include an ""idyllic cottage"", a houseboat and even a castle. Only one Airbnb host contacted by BBC News said their rental was available solely to keyworkers. But others complained the lockdown had disrupted their business. In response to the BBC News's findings, Tourism Minister Nigel Huddleston said: ""Our advice is clear. ""Essential travel does not include holidays, leisure travel and visits to second homes - and people must remain in their primary residence. “It is incredibly irresponsible, and dangerous for some property owners to be marketing themselves as ‘isolation retreats’. ""We are writing to companies today to remind them of their responsibilities at this time."" Individuals and businesses could face fines of up to £960 for breaking these rules, the government added. Lost income After being contacted by the BBC, Airbnb disabled its ""instant book"" function for whole properties.""We want hosts and guests to follow the rules and we have no tolerance for listings that ignore health or travel advisories,"" an Airbnb spokesperson said. ""The government has set out clear guidance on the limited conditions under which necessary travel is permitted and we have taken a number of steps to support these measures.""Hosts in the UK are also opening their homes to NHS and other healthcare providers as part of a global initiative that has seen more than 100,000 places to stay made available so far."" Last month, Airbnb announced a worldwide extension to its “extenuating circumstances” policy, stating all guests booked for check-ins between 14 March and 31 May would be eligible for full-refund cancellations. In a message on its website, the company acknowledged the decision to offer guests a refund had caused hardship for many hosts and it would pay £200m to help cover the cost of these cancellations. But one Airbnb host told BBC News they had received no clear instructions from the platform to say they were not allowed to take reservations.","Airbnb hosts advertising properties as coronavirus hideouts are ""dangerous and irresponsible"", the government says."
"Known as a ""sponsored story"", the ads popped up on a user's friends' pages after the user clicked to ""like"" a firm's advert. The lawsuit was brought by five members of Facebook who said the ads violated Facebook members' rights to control the use of their activity on the site. Facebook has declined to comment on the lawsuit and settlement. The deal with users who sued was reached in May, but court documents were made public this weekend. The Facebook users filed their lawsuit in December 2011 in a federal court in San Jose, California, claiming that the social network had violated the state law by making their ""likes"" known to others without allowing them to opt out or paying them. Multiple lawsuits According to Reuters news agency, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg is quoted in the lawsuit as saying that such friend endorsement is the ""Holy Grail"" of advertising. But the judge ruled in favour of the plaintiffs. ""California has long recognised a right to protect one's name and likeness against appropriation by others for their advantage,"" Judge Lucy Koh wrote, reported Reuters. The social network said the settlement funds would go to charity. It is just another court case involving the social networking giant, which listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange in May. One of the most recent cases involves Mr Zuckerberg and the banks leading the firm's flotation being sued by shareholders who allege that the site's revised growth figures were not disclosed to all investors. In a different case, Yahoo has filed an intellectual property lawsuit against Facebook, claiming the social network has infringed 10 of its patents, including systems and methods for advertising on the web. Facebook denies the allegations.","Facebook is to pay $10m (£6m) to charity to settle a lawsuit over the way it used ""social"" ads."
"And cybercrime? Not so much. With online crime it is much harder for the police to pursue a single perp. This has provoked a change in the way hi-tech crimes are tackled. Now it is about infrastructure, not individuals. ""It's all part of a realisation among info-security workers and law enforcement that traditional ways of doing investigations have not been working,"" said Steve Santorelli from Team Cymru, a non-profit group that monitors the net seeking botnets and other criminal resources. ""The more traditional 'identify the bad guys, arrest them and lock them up' has been falling short,"" he said. Server shutdown Bureaucracy is part of the reason for this, said veteran computer security expert Chester Wisniewski from Sophos. Cross-continental co-operation between police forces has improved in recent years, he said, but the procedures required to mount international operations remain formidable. Typically, he said, official requests for help between forces are done via a diplomatic agreement known as a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty. ""The MLAT process can take a year among friendly nations,"" he said. ""So between nations that do not have the best relationship it might never happen."" MLATs are also not designed to handle the volumes of cases revealed by work to combat cross-border cybercrime. Instead, he said, it is meant for a few high profile cases. Police forces have found other ways to collaborate internationally and this has prompted a change in tactics. Now, instead of going after the criminals they go after the servers and compromised computers used to carry out the crimes. ""You need to increase the cost of them doing business,"" said Mr Santorelli. Taking away servers, cutting off access to the armies of compromised PCs all makes it more troubling, and costly, for criminals to operate. One large-scale effort to get at the criminal infrastructure is Europe's Advanced Cyber Defence Centre (ACDC). Funded by the European Commission, this has led to the creation of call centres in nine European nations. These get information about infected machines from ISPs who tell customers to contact the call centre to get help to clean up their compromised machines. Removing machines from botnets is essential for a couple of reasons, said Peter Meyer, co-ordinator of the Centre. ""If you just catch one guy and do not shut down the infrastructure then the next day there will be someone that takes it over,"" he said. ""It's really important to shut down the command and control systems."" In addition, he said, removing that infrastructure forces criminals to recruit more machines thus soaking up their time and resources. It's a big job, he said, because up to 5% of the computers on domestic ISPs are believed to be part of a criminal botnet. As well as cleaning up machines, the initiative is also trying to help police forces. ""Law enforcement is really interested in getting a better picture because they are often not well-funded and we have data,"" he said. ""The fight against cybercrime is not something one individual can win."" Knocked offline The change in tactics has led to a flurry of raids. In early April, the FBI, Europol and the UK's National Crime Agency took action against the Beebone botnet. The forces seized web domains used by the botnet's owners to control the distributed system of infected machines. Knocking these out meant control of the botnet was taken away from its operators. It was one of a rash of raids carried out in 2014 and early 2015. In mid-2014 a huge operation was mounted against the botnet GameOver Zeus that, by itself, was responsible for infecting millions of computers every year. It was also one of the main routes by which the notorious cryptolocker bug was spread. This malicious program encrypted data and demanded a ransom of 400 US dollars or euros within a short time limit or the scrambled data would be deleted. The gang behind cryptolocker is believed to have made about $3m (£2m) via the ransomware. Seizing its infrastructure helped security experts decode cryptolocker and get at the keys it used to lock data away. The operations against Beebone and Gameover Zeus took lots of time, planning and international co-operation. At other times, security firms have moved more quickly simply because the scale of the criminal activity demands it. A case in point was the action that Cisco's Talos security team and Level 3 took against a cybercrime group known as SSH Psychos. ""The attacks they were carrying out were just so blatant and aggressive,"" said Craig Williams, technical head of the Talos team. The Psychos were scanning the entire internet looking for Linux servers running the secure SSH protocol. Used properly it lets a server's owner log in securely to that machine even though they may be a long way away from it. At its peak, the SSH Psycho scanning consumed more than one-third of all net traffic intended for servers capable of handling it. On every server, the attack tried 300,000 common passwords in succession to see if any worked. Some did and very quickly the Psychos had compromised about 1,000 machines. Usually such attacks are much more stealthy, said Mr Williams, adding: ""These guys didn't care they were being noticed."" In response, Level 3 and Cisco changed the way data from the attack was handled by net hardware they controlled. They essentially poured it into a virtual dustbin. This ended the scanning and stopped the password attacks. It got more even effective when some other large ISPs joined in. How a sinkhole cuts off cyber crime With a sinkhole, law enforcement attempts to cut the link between cyber-criminals and the computers they compromise. Instead of hijacked PCs reporting in to the hi-tech criminals the data is diverted so it never reaches them. Instead it is analysed to help security firms tackle infections and make the business of cybercrime more expensive. The Psychos responded and mounted an attack from elsewhere on the net. This too was poured into the trash can. The tactic seems to have worked as the Psychos have not come back. Not yet. ""I suspect they will move again,"" said Mr Williams. ""And we can block them again."" Dale Drew from Level 3 said he hoped this action was the start of a broader effort by the security community to take on cyber-thieves. ""The security community spends a significant amount of time just observing when really we need to take action,"" he said. ""We've got a real opportunity here to be more fluid and responsive than the bad guys.""","If someone has been mugged, there's a mugger to catch. If a car is stolen, there'll be a thief to find. If a bank is robbed, there will be a robber to track down."
"By Romi LevineBBC World Service Amir Taaki is a developer who works with a virtual currency called Bitcoin. His home and office is an abandoned Buddhist temple. The dwelling is covered in brightly painted but slowly decaying murals of Buddha, with the odd makeshift bunk bed and flotsam furniture like a couch with no pillows. His fellow squatters are members of the Occupy movement and Mr Taaki's Bitcoin philosophy is very much in line with theirs. ""Bitcoin is for pure financial freedom of speech,"" he says. ""It really changes the dynamics of how money works."" His voice exudes passion for the currency. ""Bitcoin is the proper perfect economy,"" he says. ""The technology needed to participate is open, the entry and exit is basically very cheap or free, there's no barriers to competing in that network."" The currency exists exclusively online and is independent of any government or company. It was spawned in 2009 by an unknown person or group of people calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto. Early adopters, including Mr Taaki, were mostly tech-minded people with distrust in regulated banking institutions. Like other currencies it is used to buy goods and services. Companies selling anything from software, pizza and online dating are jumping on board - accepting it as payment. But what makes Bitcoin attractive to many of its users is its relative anonymity. ""You can make as many Bitcoin addresses as you want,"" Mr Taaki says. ""So that's how you preserve your anonymity because you give every person a different Bitcoin address so they don't know what Bitcoins are connected to you."" Because Bitcoins are hard to regulate and transactions tough to trace, the currency is a haven for black market activity spearheaded by an online marketplace for illegal drugs and fake IDs called Silk Road. Silk Road accepts Bitcoins as payment. ""It's a really powerful thing,"" says Mr Taaki. The activist says Bitcoin's use on Silk Road has been a good thing for libertarian reasons - but adds that there is also potential for less controversial uses of the currency which are not easily supported by the current banking system. ""You can make distributed, publicly funded services using Bitcoin, you can have micro-philanthropy,"" he exclaims. ""A lot of people think our financial problems should be solved by laying on more regulation but the thing with that regulation is it enforces monopoly. It puts more power into the guys who can comply with that regulation."" ""It closes out the idealistic guys at the bottom who actually want to change things."" The currency's links to illegal activity have not deterred people from becoming interested in it. Demand has recently been bolstered by distrust in traditional financial institutions stoked by the banking crisis in Cyprus. This, along with speculative investors, caused the value of a Bitcoin unit to double in a matter of weeks. It has since become more volatile, experiencing a drop of over half of its value in one day. According to data from Bitcoin Charts, the past week alone has seen the value of one Bitcoin range from $266 (£172) to $50 (£32). Bitcoin saw a similar boom in 2011 followed by a crash. Its unpredictable nature has incited a fear of history repeating itself but Chris Cook, a senior fellow at University College London's Institute for Security and Resilience Studies says the volatile nature of the currency is just a symptom of changing supply and demand. ""At the moment it's increasing rapidly because there's a massive interest in it,"" he says. ""Once that demand ceases it may stabilise. On the other hand other people may come in and say 'oh I made a lot of money on my Bitcoins, I might sell some,' - in which case we would see the price come down."" But the Bitcoin system isn't airtight. There have been a number of Bitcoin thefts by hackers and even a Ponzi scheme cheating investors out of millions of dollars. Mr Cook says that's just the cost of doing business. ""Bitcoin is disruptive, it's changing the game completely, but it is fundamentally flawed,"" he says. ""If you get hold of a code, a Bitcoin code, then it's yours. As far as that goes, whoever had it has lost it. It's like a bare instrument, it's like a coin."" Mr Cook adds that it's an attractive outlet for virtual crime. ""The more expensive it gets the more you'll find that all the world's online criminals focus and descend upon the people who have access to Bitcoins."" This hasn't stopped Bitcoin's users from believing and investing in the currency. Jeff Berwick is one such entrepreneur. He has developed the first Bitcoin cash machine, which will convert a person's Bitcoins into the currency of the country where they are withdrawn. ""Over 200 people have said they're interested in buying a machine or more than one from 30 different countries,"" he says. He says he plans to put one of his first machines in Cyprus where the amount of money people can take out of machines is restricted because of strict financial regulations. ""This is a way to transact outside of the traditional, regulatory monetary system,"" he says. However, optimistic Bitcoin supporters are, the future of the currency is hazy and unpredictable. But Mr Cook says he believes the importance of Bitcoin does not revolve around the currency itself, but rather the concept of alternative currencies and their place in the global economy. ""It's a sign of the way that things are going to go,"" he says. ""Networked currency and networked transactions are going to look very different from the banking system that we know.""",Who would have thought one of the tech wizards behind a global currency would live in a squat?
"Mr Ive, who can now style himself Sir Jonathan, has been made a Knight Commander of the British Empire (KBE). Raised in Chingford, Mr Ive began working for Apple in 1992 and since then has been the brains behind many of its products. He described the honour as ""absolutely thrilling"" and said he was ""both humbled and sincerely grateful"". Mr Ive added: ""I am keenly aware that I benefit from a wonderful tradition in the UK of designing and making. ""I discovered at an early age that all I've ever wanted to do is design."" Team work Mr Ive has been lauded for the tight fit between form and function seen in Apple gadgets such as the iPod and iPhone. Born in February 1967, Mr Ive inherited a love of making things from his father, a silversmith, and reportedly spent much of his youth taking things apart to see how they worked. From the age of 14, he said, he knew he was interested in drawing and making ""stuff"" and this led him to Newcastle Polytechnic - now Northumbria University - where he studied industrial design. On graduation he started work as a commercial designer and then, with three friends, founded a design agency called Tangerine. One of the clients for the agency was Apple which was so impressed with the work he did on a prototype notebook that it offered him a full-time job. Mr Ive was apparently frustrated during his early years at Apple as the company was then suffering a decline. Everything changed, however, in 1996 when Apple bought Next and Steve Jobs returned to the company he helped found. ""What's made him so outstandingly successful is the relationship he's had with Steve Jobs and Apple,"" said Deyan Sudjic, director of The Design Museum. ""He's been working there for 19 years and has built up the kind of relationship that's very rare."" Mr Jobs described Mr Ive as his ""spiritual partner"" in the recent biography of the Apple co-founder written by Walter Isaacson. However, it also said that Mr Ive was ""hurt"" by Mr Jobs taking credit for innovations that came from the design team. Mr Ive's eye for design combined effectively with Mr Jobs' legendary attention to detail and the products that have emerged from the company since the late 1990s have turned Apple into one of the biggest and most influential technology companies on the planet. Mr Sudjic said Mr Ive's talent was to help people stop worrying about technology and just get on with using it. There have been some mis-steps along the way. Most recently, Apple's iPhone 4 was criticised because many people said signal strength dropped when their hand touched the phone's metal case. This was thought to be because the antenna for the handset formed part of the device's metal shell. In contrast to many other design celebrities, said Mr Sudjic, Mr Ive had not cashed in on his fame but had let what he and his team created speak for itself. Mr Sudjic said: ""He has a very determined sense of getting things right."" The knighthood is the second time Mr Ive has been recognised in the honours list. In 2005 he was made a Commander of the British Empire (CBE). His KBE was announced on thediplomatic and overseas list.","Jonathan Ive, Apple's head of design, has been awarded a knighthood in the New Year Honours list."
"By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter Hull, with an average of 12.4Mbps, is the UK's slowest city, according to comparison site uSwitch, which conducted the tests. London and Edinburgh had average speeds of 22.4Mbps and 21Mbps respectively. These speeds are likely to be low not because of lack of availability but because people have chosen not to take up faster services. Government figures suggest superfast broadband - 24Mbps or higher - is now available to more than 90% of homes and businesses, with funding pledged to bring that total to 95% by 2017. According to BT, its fibre services are available to 24 million home, but only 22% (5.5 million) have connected to them. Hull is the only UK city not served by BT's Openreach, which controls the telecoms network. Hull's independent supplier, KCOM, disputed the findings. ""We're rolling out ultrafast fibre to the home across Hull and East Yorkshire, which means speeds of 250Mbps are available to consumers right now,"" said a KCOM spokesman. The company says it is connecting ""a new customer to fibre every 30 minutes"". But uSwitch's Ewan Taylor-Gibson said: ""Actual speed tests taken by broadband users would suggest this hasn't reached enough homes yet to make an impact on the average."" Three in 10 tests logged speeds of less than 5Mbps with just one in 10 registering speeds of above 50Mbps, according to the data. The top 10 The bottom 10 ""We should be asking what more can be done to encourage the adoption of superfast broadband now it's so widely available,"" he said. ""The UK's towns and cities should be leading the charge when it comes to broadband speeds, yet just 22 cities have broadband users with average speeds of more than 24Mbps."" Co-founder of broadband news site Thinkbroadband Sebastien Lahtinen said: ""Broadband speed tests are a great way to measure real world speeds experienced by users - but they also serve as a measure of take-up, not just availability."" ""Whilst early adopters and digital natives are often craving for faster and faster services, not everyone wants to stream multiple HD streams live whilst playing online games. Those who just use the Internet for the occasional catch-up TV programme, email and Facebook, broadband speed is not really a priority, especially when the fastest services can cost considerably more.""",Tests on 42 towns and cities across the UK suggest almost half have average broadband speeds below 24Mbps.
"The social network restricted how much information app developers could gather from Groups, following the Cambridge Analytica data scandal. But it said about 100 developers had retained access to Group data, such as people's names and photos. Facebook did not say how many members had been affected by the flaw. ""We can be in little doubt that there are groups out there that seek to abuse these kinds of flaws to artificially shape debate, manipulate voters and influence election results,"" Mike Beck from the cyber-security company Darktrace told the BBC. Like other social networks, Facebook provides an application programming interface (API) that lets app developers connect their own creations to Facebook. But in 2018, it was revealed that Cambridge Analytica had harvested the personal data of millions of people by creating a personality quiz on Facebook - and used the data to target political advertising. In October, Facebook agreed to pay a £500,000 fine imposed by the UK's data protection watchdog, for its role in the scandal. Following the scandal, Facebook restricted access to many of its APIs, including the one that let app developers connect to Groups on the social network. With permission, app developers could access a group's name, the number of members and the content of posts. However, they could only access member names and photos if people explicitly opted in. But on Tuesday, the company revealed that about 100 ""partners"" retained access following the change. It said ""at least"" 11 developers had accessed the restricted information in the last 60 days. ""Although we've seen no evidence of abuse, we will ask them to delete any member data they may have retained, and we will conduct audits to confirm that it has been deleted,"" Facebook said in a statement.",Facebook says it has discovered a new privacy flaw on its platform that lets some app developers access data in Groups that they should not have.
"Cheap miniature versions of the unmanned aircraft used by the military could fall into the wrong hands, he told the UK's Guardian newspaper. Quarrelling neighbours, he suggested, might end up buzzing each other with private surveillance drones. He also warned of the risk of terrorists using the new technology. Mr Schmidt is believed to have close relations with US President Barack Obama, whom he advises on matters of science and technology. ""You're having a dispute with your neighbour,"" he told The Guardian in an interview printed on Saturday. ""How would you feel if your neighbour went over and bought a commercial observation drone that they can launch from their backyard. It just flies over your house all day. How would you feel about it?"" Warning of mini-drones' potential as a terrorist weapon, he said: ""I'm not going to pass judgment on whether armies should exist, but I would prefer to not spread and democratise the ability to fight war to every single human being."" ""It's got to be regulated... It's one thing for governments, who have some legitimacy in what they're doing, but have other people doing it... it's not going to happen."" Small drones, such as flying cameras, are already available worldwide, and non-military surveillance were recently introduced to track poachers in the remote Indian state of Assam. The US and Israel have led the way in recent years in using drones as weapons of war as well as for surveillance. America's Federal Aviation Administration is currently exploring how commercial drones, or unmanned aircraft systems, can be safely introduced into US airspace.","The influential head of Google, Eric Schmidt, has called for civilian drone technology to be regulated, warning about privacy and security concerns."
"By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor Yet it's a separate wing of the company, offering something altogether more intangible, that could prove more important to both its long-term future and yours. Amazon Web Services has a lower public profile than the firm's online stores, but it already touches many lives. From young tech titans, including Spotify, Dropbox, Netflix, Pinterest and Airbnb, to more established brands, such as General Electric, Samsung, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia and the BBC itself, a long list of organisations are turning to the US firm to provide some or all of their net-based services. It's proving popular too with governments seeking to cut their IT bills. Even the CIA recently became a customer. AWS's products range all the way from storage and data crunching tools to providing the code and computing power needed to offer ""cloud-run"" products. Many of the functions you might think as belonging to your smartphone apps - including the abilities to stream video, synchronise data between devices and get notification alerts - are frequently carried out by AWS's data centres. If centralising all this work with one company sounds a radical step, Amazon suggests there is precedent. ""About 150 years ago lots of companies had their own electricity grids on premises, and that didn't seem like such a strange thing to do,"" Andy Jassy, chief of the AWS division, tells the BBC. ""But then with the advent of the [national] grid, the economies were such that it didn't really make any sense. ""The same is happening for computing, where traditionally most companies have had their own data centres. ""We believe in the fullness of time, just like what happened with the electricity grid, relatively few companies will own their own data centres. All that computing is going to move to the cloud."" Many outsiders agree that the pitch is compelling. ""Any new class of application that is built to efficiently use resources only when it needs them is going to move - the economics are just too compelling,"" says James Staten, an analyst at the Forrester tech consultancy. ""It's also incredibly empowering to a developer that so many of the services they want are just sitting there. You don't have to write them, you can simply connect to them and your application is finished."" AWS in numbers Source: Amazon, unless otherwise stated Amazon pioneered the idea of offering cloud computing as a service after discovering its own staff kept ""reinventing the wheel"" as they worked on different internal projects. It then figured out it could both use the tools to both streamline its own work and make money by charging others to access them. ""There were a lot of pundits and people from larger companies that said, 'Well, nobody will ever use these services for anything real,'"" says Mr Jassy. While it's true that many of AWS's first customers initially signed up only to test products behind the scenes, the success of various start-ups that dared employ it to provide public-facing services meant it didn't take long to gain mainstream appeal. ""There is a very real chance that in the fullness of time that AWS will be the largest business in Amazon,"" says Mr Jassy. ""It will take time, but it's a pretty significant statement if you think about our retail business being roughly a $70bn [sales a year] business."" But the division faces headwinds. AWS no longer has the market to itself. Microsoft, IBM, and Google's rival crowd-computing platforms are smaller but reported to be growing at faster rates. Investors may become impatient. Amazon as a whole posted a $563m (£358m) loss for the last half of the year. That was in part because of all the resources poured into AWS and the fact that the unit keeps cutting its prices. Mr Jassy says the intention is for AWS to be a ""high volume, low margin"" member of the Amazon family, but several experts advocate its spin-off. Data sovereignty has also become a hot topic - the idea that people's information should be kept in the same country they live in to make sure the companies involved are subject to local privacy laws. AWS is somewhat protected, however, by the fact it has data centres in Germany, Brazil, China and Australia - four of the countries making the most noise about the issue. In fact, the greatest drag on AWS's growth may be lingering doubts about its tech's maturity, particularly for critical services. Amazon and other leading cloud-computing providers suggest that because they operate many data centres, even if there's a problem at one, customers should not experience disruption. But that didn't stop services run on Microsoft's Azure platform dropping offline across the world last month after an update to its software proved problematic. And previously, AWS has faced failures of its own. ""At this scale, small errors in operational procedures can have outsized impacts,"" says Mr Staten. ""But each time that happens, the firms learn from those activities and the next time something happens, the likelihood of there being as broad an outage diminishes. ""As a customer you have to expect that some of the services will go down periodically, but that also happens in corporate data centres today."" And Mr Jassy indicates such worries could, in fact, play to Amazon's advantage. ""There's no compression algorithm for experience,"" he says. ""You can't learn the lessons that we've learned until you get to various levels of scale running cloud computing platforms, and none of the other providers have gotten to those levels of scale yet."" Keeping data safe Being entrusted with others' corporate secrets involves a high level of trust. Amazon stresses that the use of encryption means it can't peer into the files saved to its computers. But it doesn't stop there. No member of staff - not even Mr Jassy - is allowed access to both a physical data centre and the software used to operate it. Moreover, the exact location of the data centres themselves are kept secret and only provided on a need-to-know basis. And special machines are kept on site so that when hard disks fall out of use they can be de-magnetised and ground up to avoid the risk of anyone else retrieving information from the storage when it's disposed of off-site.","The seemingly endless - yet still ever growing - range of products you can lay your hands on via Amazon has seen the internet company dubbed the ""everything store""."
"By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter An issue with its power supply meant it would now be sent out ""after Christmas"", said a spokesman. The tiny computer has been designed to boost interest in coding. The problem had ""affected a small number of devices"", the spokesman said, but the priority was making sure it was as robust and reliable as possible. ""We're expecting to start sending them out to teachers before Christmas and to children early in the new year,"" said a BBC spokesman ""As a result of our rigorous testing process, we've decided to make some minor revisions to the device - getting it right for children and teachers before we manufacture one million units is our priority.""

The pocket-sized codeable computer is the BBC's most ambitious education initiative for 30 years. In the 1980s, the BBC launched the Micro, which introduced many children to computing. BBC director general Tony Hall hopes the Micro Bit will ""equip a new generation with the digital skills they need to find jobs and help grow the UK economy"". The push to persuade more children to get involved in computing and coding comes as the UK faces a critical skills shortage in the technology sector.

"The CyanogenMod (CM) lets phone users swap the official version of Android for one that gives them more control over their phone or tablet. It has reportedly been installed on over seven million Android devices. The investment has helped found a company to employ the coders, who have been working on the project unpaid. Cyanogen Inc will be based in Seattle and have as its technology chief Steve Kondik, who did a lot of the early work on the Android mod. Installing the mod lets Android owners clean out unwanted apps and programs put on a phone by manufacturers and mobile operators. In addition, it gives them access to apps and features developed solely for Cyanogen. The first job of the company, wrote Mr Kondik, was to make a universal installer that eased the process of replacing the official Android code found on a phone with Cyanogen. The current installation process was ""hideous"", admitted Mr Kondik, adding that the new installer would be available in a few weeks. Taking a longer view, Mr Kondik said the goal of the company was to outdo Google and create an operating system for a phone that was ""actually designed by and for the people who use it"". ""We think that the time has come for your mobile device to truly be yours again, and we want to bring that idea to everybody,"" he wrote in a blog on the company's website. In a separate blogpost Mitch Lasky, one of the venture capitalists who helped raise the cash, said Android's growth was opening up opportunities for companies such as Cyanogen that could improve on the experience provided to users by Google, handset makers and operators. The fact that more than half of all Android owners ran an old version of the operating system showed there was room to improve that experience, he added. ""We believe that CM is poised to become one of the largest mobile operating systems in the world,"" he wrote.",A team of Android programmers has raised a $7m (£4.3m) investment to turn their hobby project into a rival to Google's phone operating system.
"Dave LeeNorth America technology reporter Since its launch in July 2016, players of the game have collectively walked 12 billion miles on the hunt for the little monsters. But sophisticated as Pokemon Go was, one critical flaw crushed the illusion of “seeing” a Pikachu in front of you. If something got in the way of your phone’s camera, the Pokemon would be rendered on top. “It really falls apart,” acknowledged John Hanke, chief executive of Niantic, the app's creator. “It breaks the illusion that this thing actually exists in the world, because it’s not behaving right.” To solve the problem, Niantic has acquired Matrix Mill, a four-person company spun out of University College London and based in Covent Garden - where it will remain. The terms of the acquisition have not been made public. But Niantic says the deal has the potential to make AR much more realistic. Near and far The simple way to solve the overlay problem is to have a device that has two cameras. Each lens can take a slightly different image, and by combining the two a calculation can be made as to how far away an object is. Your eyes and brain work in much the same way. But try this - put your hand over one eye and look around you. Despite losing your depth perception, you can still judge how far away objects are. That’s because, unless you’re Father Dougal, you instinctively figure out when something is either small or just far away, based on your past experience of the object's typical size. This is how Matrix Mill’s software is designed to work, making it possible for a smartphone with only one camera lens to make a pretty good guess about depth. The software sees an object, recognises it, calculates how far away it is most likely to be and determines whether the Pokemon should appear in front or behind. “It allows the characters to join your environment,” Gabriel Brostow, one of Matrix Mill’s co-founders explained. “Whatever is around you, your characters should understand that and be interacting with that too. Suddenly you’re not just dealing with everything on a single plate.” The end result was demonstrated in a short proof-of-concept clip shared by Niantic on Thursday. Where Pikachu was previously stuck to the area directly in front of you, he (it?) can now happily run around between real-world people and hide behind plant pots. Freeze frames reveal the tech doesn't work perfectly. There are flickers and misjudged placements at times. But as gamers play an updated version of the game, they will help Niantic's system become smarter at recognising objects. Next stop: Hogwarts Pokemon Go has been downloaded about 800 million times, but there’s no doubt that it is past its 2016 heyday, when beaches and parks were full of Pokemon hunters. These days gamers are more likely to be fighting for survival in Fortnite. Enter: the boy wizard. Niantic’s next major title will be a Harry Potter game. “What you can expect is something that draws on Pokemon Go in terms of what worked about that game,"" Mr Hanke said. ""It will be a game where you go outside, you are drawn to new places and you play together with your friends. “But we’re also using it as a place to explore new gameplay mechanics and new technology.” He declined to reveal a release date. Opening up the platform Also in the works are multi-player experiences that will allow up to eight players to interact in the same augmented space - a concept greatly limited, in my view, by the drawbacks of smartphone AR. A virtual world, however exciting, lacks any sense of immersion when viewed through such a small screen. In that regard, smartglasses can’t come soon enough. Bigger news for the AR industry, perhaps, is Niantic’s decision to open up its “real world” technology to outsiders. It means the technology that powers Pokemon Go, and the vast amounts of real-world intelligence gathered as a result, will be shared. “We will continue to make games in that genre,” Mr Hanke told the BBC. “But obviously it’s an area much bigger, in terms of the creative space, than we can occupy ourselves. “I’m excited to make a platform available to other people to do things that frankly we might never imagine, because people are going to bring their own vision.” As part of the arrangement, Niantic wants to publish the third-party games that use its tech. But Mr Hanke would not be drawn on whether he might agree instead to charge a licensing fee in the future. _______ Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC Do you have more information about this or any other technology story?

"The social network is currently running an advertising campaign in the UK that declares ""fake news is not our friend"". But it said publishers often had ""very different points of view"" and removing fabricated posts would be ""contrary to the basic principles of free speech"". Instead, it says posts that it deems to be fake news will be ""demoted"" in the news feed. Facebook has been scrutinised for its role in spreading fake news after evidence emerged that Russia tried to influence US voters using the social network. On Wednesday, the company held an event in New York where it sought to convince journalists it was tackling the problem. CNN reporter Oliver Darcy asked how the company could claim to be tackling the spread of misinformation when it allowed the InfoWars page to remain on the platform. InfoWars produces live talk shows online and has more than 900,000 followers on Facebook. Its primary host, Alex Jones, has more than 2.4 million subscribers on YouTube. However, the platform has pushed demonstrably false information, such as the conspiracy theory that the Sandy Hook school shooting in 2012 was faked by the US government. Responding to CNN, Facebook's John Hegeman said: ""We created Facebook to be a place where different people can have a voice."" The company said it would not remove fake news that did not break its rules but would down-rank content that had been marked as false. ""We allow people to post it as a form of expression, but we're not going to show it at the top of News Feed,"" a spokeswoman told CNN. The site had trialled displaying a red warning icon next to articles that fact checkers had identified as false, but later said it found this approach had ""entrenched deeply held beliefs"". Facebook's Sara Su told reporters on Wednesday that fake news and conspiracy theories ""can be really problematic and it bugs me, too"". But InfoWars contributor Paul Watson suggested CNN was ""lobbying a company to shut down a smaller competitor"".",Facebook says it will not remove fake news from its platform because it does not violate its community standards.
"By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter Artificial intelligence agents are already involved in every aspect of our lives - they keep our inboxes free of spam, they help us make our web transactions, they fly our planes and if Google gets its way will also soon drive our cars for us. ""AI's are embedded in the fabric of our everyday lives,"" head of AI at Singularity University, Neil Jacobstein, told the BBC. ""They are used in medicine, in law, in design and throughout automotive industry."" And each day the algorithms that power away, making decisions behind the scenes, are getting smarter. It means that one of the biggest quests of the modern world - the search to make machines as intelligent as humans - could be getting tantalisingly close. Mr Jacobstein predicts that artificial intelligence will overtake human intelligence in the mid-2020s, begging the question - what will a society dominated by machine intelligence look like and what exactly will be our role in it? Stealing jobs? We may get to put our feet up more, for a start. Chinese company Hon Hai, the world's largest contract electronics manufacturer, has announced it intends to build a robot-making factory and replace 500,000 workers with robots over the next three years. But not having a job will also mean not having a wage, a radical change for a world used to working for a living. ""AIs will cause significant unemployment but that doesn't equate with poverty,"" said Mr Jacobstein. ""AIs and other exponential technologies are going to generate vast amounts of wealth. ""We have to be willing to change the social contract we have with people about how wealth is distributed."" He tends towards the optimistic view of machines and humans working in perfect harmony, side by side. ""The best combination for problem solving is a human and a computer,"" he said. Dangerous future Author and documentary-maker James Barrat sits in a very different camp. He is so worried about the onslaught of artificial intelligence that he has written a book about it. Our Final Invention examines whether the increasing domination of artificial intelligence is going to mean the end of the human era. ""Advanced AI is a dual-use technology, like nuclear fission. Fission can illuminate cities or incinerate them. At advanced levels, AI will be even more volatile and dangerous than fission, and it's already being weaponised in autonomous drones and battlefield robots,"" Barrat told the BBC. ""More than any other science it forces us to probe ourselves - what are these things we call intelligence, conscience, emotion? But in looking inward we better see our own predilection for irrational violence and technological recklessness. Our innovation always runs far ahead of our stewardship,"" he said. The robot revolution may be some way off if a competition organised by the Pentagon's research unit Darpa in December is anything to go by. Videos posted online showed the robots remained much slower than humans, often unsteady on their feet with some failing to complete any of the challenges. Google bot Nonetheless there is a buzz around robots and artificial intelligence at the moment. Google has just bought eight robotic firms, while Facebook has its very own AI lab. Speculation is rife about what Google will do with its new acquisition. Google robots could be very powerful, thinks Mr Barrat. ""That's one route to human level intelligence. A high quality personal assistant wouldn't be just a smartphone - it'd have a humanoid body. Why humanoid? So it can drive your car, use your tools, bounce the baby, act as your bodyguard if need be,"" he said. If the rise of the robots is inevitable - albeit a few years off - then it is also a logical step that humans will eventually be eliminated from the decision chain entirely, meaning AIs will be controlling other AIs. That was already happening in our laptops and computers, said Mr Jacobstein. ""Anti-virus software is basically AI techniques that is being used to detect other AIs that we call viruses and worms,"" he said. But he acknowledges that controls to make sure that the phrase ""robot failure"" doesn't replace ""human failure"" would have to be built into future AI systems. ""We would build the same layered control system we need in everyday life with humans. We want to look at the risks and build controls that stops that rogue behaviour,"" he said. Brain upgrade While Mr Jacobstein remains sanguine about the robot takeover, he is well aware that many see it as the stuff of nightmares. ""Some people ask, 'How do you sleep at night knowing the prospects for artificial intelligence?' but it isn't artificial intelligence that keeps me awake at night, it is human stupidity,"" he said. For him, the only way that humans will keep up with the robots is to become more like them. ""Our brains haven't had a major upgrade for 50,000 years and if your laptop or smartphone hadn't had an upgrade in five years you might be concerned about that,"" he said. Already we have access to AI's such as Siri and Google Now and are pretty much constantly connected to the web via our smartphones, so it isn't so much of a step to imagine a future where silicon is embedded in our skulls. And it could be the only way for us to keep up with the robots.","If you worry that the robots are coming, don't, because they are already here."
"The Swedish developer is requesting payment for Cliffhorse in the virtual currency Dogecoin, although it can be downloaded without doing so. He has tweeted that the game - in which the player controls a galloping horse that can chase an animal-skinned ball - only took him two hours to create. Other posts indicate the game is a deliberate spoof. However, that has not stopped people from paying for it. Mr Persson noted that his initial tweet advertising the ""early access"" title had raised more than $100 (£60) in the hours after he posted it. He later created a website to promote the game, which pointedly states that there is ""no guarantee of future updates"". Scott Grill, a writer for the Examiner news site, is among those who have interpreted Cliffhorse as being a means to criticise the sale of other ""early access games that have been appearing on Steam and other places where very little work and semblance of a game exists"". Examples of controversial uncompleted PC games put on sale include: The controversy has prompted the US-based owner of the Steam platform, Valve, to update its Early Access Games FAQ last week to state: ""You should be aware that some teams will be unable to 'finish' their game. So you should only buy an Early Access game if you are excited about playing it in its current state."" However, an English gamer known as PewGeminiLive suggested some people were reading too much into the release. ""Notch and I came up with the idea during one of my live streams on Twitch while playing Skyrim,"" he told the BBC. ""The game was a simple joke to make fun of the ""horse mechanics"" whilst on a cliff."" 'That's crazy' The world-building game Minecraft was itself an ""early release"" game - sold as first an ""alpha"" and then ""beta"" branded title over the first years of its life. It has gone on to become one of the best-selling and best-reviewed games of all time. This is what, perhaps, convinced people to pay for Cliffhorse despite the fact it appears to be a spoof. Nonetheless, one UK games blogger was left dispirited by the reaction. ""It's an obvious joke and from what I know of the Unity Engine, most of the assets from the game are already defaulted in-engine, and all Notch had to do was look through the asset store and download a free horse model,"" wrote Justin Ross on the Pixel Gate site. ""Really no work whatsoever had to go into making this game, and there's even people spending money on this thing. That's crazy."" Mr Persson's stunt was released on the eve of the video games industry event, E3. Although the Los Angeles expo tends to focus on console titles, there is also a PC-themed spin-off - the Nvidia Gaming Expo - organised by the computer chip-maker, which runs over the same period.","Markus ""Notch"" Persson is ""selling"" his first video game since Minecraft."

Elyse Betters Picaro, US editor of Pocket-lint and a regular user, said Snapchat had ""begun mixing ad-laden Stories into your chats now, because, as the numbers have shown, people are sending tonnes of snaps a day now, but they aren't posting to their stories as much. ""Stories from your ""normal"" friends now appear in chats, while famous and popular Snapchat users are still on the side with the media, which appears to create a sort of class system. ""It's also difficult to find stories from people who don't follow you back,"" she said. ""Also stories are no longer in chronological order, and you can't play all the stories consecutively anymore."" Ms Betters Picaro added: ""It may, as a user, feel like you're missing out on something now, as it's harder to find Stories, harder to play them, and they're just seemingly harder to grasp in general now."" She added that Snapchat boss Evan Spiegel had warned users and investors about the change in November when he said: ""There is a strong likelihood that the redesign of our application will be disruptive to our business in the short term, and we don't yet know how the behaviour of our community will change when they begin to use our updated application."" Despite the poor reception, Ms Betters Picaro does not believe the firm will respond to user requests and ditch the changes. She said: ""Unfortunately, people tend to be resistant to change. And this update will take some getting used to, whether you're a fan or not. ""However, I highly doubt Snap will immediately reverse course due to bad reviews from a limited test in the UK and Canada. After all, it hasn't even hit the US yet."" A spokesperson for Snapchat said: ""Updates as big as this one can take a little getting used to, but we hope the community will enjoy it once they settle in.""","Snapchat's redesign, which was rolled out at the end of last year, has not gone down well with users."
"By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter Will schools provide resources? If your child's school already puts work online, via Google Classroom, for example, this will probably continue. But these sort of tools tend to be used more by secondary schools than primaries. So older pupils are more likely to be in the routine of checking their school's chosen platform and completing work. And they are more likely to have their own laptops. Some schools are asking older children to follow their existing timetables, with some active lessons, involving Google Hangouts and virtual classrooms, and some passive ones, in which children work independently. And depending on the individual school, there will probably be a system to allow children to submit work and have it marked. What resources are there online? ParentKind has published a list of free online resources, as has Oak National Academy, which is collated by teachers. Many schools are also providing lists of resources on a range of topics, to help parents navigate this difficult time, such as: Should we cover the curriculum? Many schools already pay for online resources, so it is worth checking which ones you can access, as these will follow the curriculum. About half of UK schools use sites such as MathsWatch, for example, which caters for children from Year 4 up to A-level. BBC Bitesize has lots of content divided into subject and age categories, with much new material added since March. The BBC will also show curriculum content on TV every weekday from Monday, 11 January: The government, meanwhile, unlike during the first national lockdown, will expect schools to deliver their own online learning. If parents have any concerns about their child's education, the government says they should raise it with a teacher in the first instance. If the matter is still not resolved, parents can contact the schools watchdog, Ofsted. How should we structure the day? Little and often is the advice from MathsWatch co-founder Ken Smith, a teacher for 34 years. ""Even an hour's lesson at school is broken down by teachers,"" he says. ""And parents need to do the same. ""It is much better to do a little bit every day."" But like the school day, it is important to establish a routine, says Sarah Dove, a teacher who works online with children who cannot attend school. ""The key is finding out what works for you as a family but have a delineation between home life and school,"" she says. ""Don't spend all day in pyjamas. ""Come together for a mindfulness session rather than an assembly and do topic-based work too."" Even at school, children are not working from 09:00 to 15:00, Ms Wespieser says. So expecting them ""to sit at the table with paper and pen"" all day is unrealistic. But it is important parents think about themselves as well. ""One of the biggest challenges parents have reported to us is balancing their own work with school work,"" she says. ""And employers may be a bit less sympathetic this time. ""Parents need to look after their own wellbeing and take the time to find what works for you. ""And schools should be giving a lot more advice."" What about devices and data? In the last lockdown, there were concerns about a digital divide between affluent families with access to laptops and those who did not have devices and may have struggled to get their children online at all. Add to that the cost of broadband and the fact some parts of the country still don't have access to decent internet speeds, and home-schooling has been a nightmare for many families. The Department for Education says that more than 700,000 devices have been delivered to schools in England so far during the pandemic - 100,000 of which were delivered last week. It says it has bought a further 300,000 laptops and tablets which will be delivered to schools for distribution. Teaching unions have said more still needs to be done, while others have called for data costs on educational apps and websites to be deducted from broadband charges. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said that the government is working with mobile phone operators to provide free data for key educational sites, Customers using BT Mobile, EE, and Plusnet Mobile will be able to access BBC Bitesize content from the end of January without eating into their data allowance. The Department for Education already runs a scheme for disadvantaged children who do not have access to a home broadband connection, while some internet providers are also helping out.","With schools once again closing their doors to most pupils, parents, many juggling work and childcare, are having to step in to fill the gap."
"The warnings are part of a larger scheme that aims to educate people about copyright and legal ways to enjoy digital content. Starting next year, up to four warnings annually will be sent to households suspected of copyright infringement. But if people ignore the warnings, no further action will be taken. The warning system is the result of four years' wrangling between internet service providers (ISPs) and industry bodies representing music and movie-makers. The original enforcement regime was outlined in the Digital Economy Act 2010 and called for ""technical measures"" to be taken against persistent pirates, including the suspension of net access after a series of warnings. 'Difficult to protect' In addition, rights holders wanted warning letters to mention the potential penalties people would face for copyright infringement and access to a database of known illegal file-sharers. The years of talks brokered by the government have led to the creation of the Voluntary Copyright Alert Programme (Vcap) that uses warnings via email or post. The UK's biggest ISPs - BT, TalkTalk, Virgin and Sky - have signed up to Vcap. Many smaller ISPs are expected to join later. In addition, the UK government has pledged to contribute £3.5m to an education campaign that will promote legal ways to listen to music and watch movies. Introducing the three-year educational scheme, Business Secretary Vince Cable said the initiative was all about supporting the UK's creative industries. ""It's a difficult industry to pin down and it's also difficult to protect,"" he said. ""But unless you protect it then it's an industry that cannot function."" 'Persuading the persuadable' Government estimates suggest the UK's creative industries contribute £71bn to the UK economy and support about 1.68 million jobs. Geoff Taylor, chief executive of the BPI, said it had been a ""long road"" to produce the Vcap agreement. He said that though it lacked punitive action it could still help bring about change in people's habits. ""It's about persuading the persuadable, such as parents who do not know what is going on with their net connection,"" he said. ""Vcap is not about denying access to the internet. It's about changing attitudes and raising awareness so people can make the right choice,"" he said. As well as taking part in Vcap, the BPI and other rights holders were working on other fronts to tackle persistent pirates, file-sharing sites and to suppress the economy that supported them, said Mr Taylor. These initiatives included issuing notices to Google about links to pirated content, action in the courts to shut down websites that offer links to infringing content, and working with advertisers to limit the funds that flow to file-sharing sites.",People in the UK who persistently pirate music and movies will soon start getting emails warning them that their actions are illegal.
"A letter has been signed by more than 150 groups before a European Parliament vote on ways to limit their sale. Many tech gadgets such as smartphones use conflict materials, so-called because they are mined in warlike conditions and traded by armed groups. The letter says the law must cover more manufacturers and types of materials, and make firms police supply chains. European politicians will vote on proposals drawn up by the European Commission on 19 May. 'Weak' proposals Signed by Amnesty International. Friends of the Earth, Global Witness, Christian Aid, the Ethical Consumer Research Association and many others, the open letter says the trade in conflict minerals fuels wars and human rights abuses around the world. It says the vote this week is a ""landmark opportunity"" for Europe to take action to stem the trade and curtail the conflict it engenders. However, it says the current proposals are ""weak"" and do not go far enough. The big problem with the scheme proposed by Brussels is that it applies on a voluntary basis to most companies, the groups argue. As a result, they say, few firms would be motivated to clean up their supply chains and report on their actions. In addition, the letter says, the scheme only covers four minerals - tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold - in their raw form, and does nothing to address products entering Europe which have been made using conflict minerals. Many smartphones, tablets and other devices made in China are manufactured using these substances. 'Right incentives' The letter says the scheme does not cover minerals and materials such as diamonds, jade and chromite, which are also known to be sources of conflict. It urges MEPs to reject the plans in favour of a stronger scheme involving a mandatory system to ensure firms vet their supply chain. ""Those bearing the cost of our weak efforts to regulate this trade will be some of the poorest and most vulnerable citizens of the world,"" said the letter. ""Now is the time for change."" Romanian MEP Iuliu Winkler - the European Parliament's lead negotiator on the plans - has previously said he ""largely supported"" the plans, adding that the priority should be ensuring that the right incentives are in place to encourage participation. However, Green and left-wing MEPs have criticised the opt-in nature of the scheme.","Europe's proposed laws on ""conflict minerals"" will fail to slow trade in the raw materials, claim rights groups."
"The Legged Squad Support System - referred to by some as ""the big dog"" - is capable of carrying 400lbs (181.4kg) of equipment over rugged terrain. But the US Marines now say its petrol-powered engine is too noisy for them to use in battle. Google has long said it planned to move away from its military contracts. 'The big dog' The LS3 was developed by Boston Dynamics - a robotics firm acquired by Google in 2013 - as part of a tie-up with the Pentagon's research arm, the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa). The robot can follow troops on foot through rugged terrain, carrying their gear. It can also interpret verbal and visual commands. However, after a major field trial in 2014, flaws in the robot also became apparent, according to Kyle Olson, a spokesman for the Marines' Warfighting Lab. ""There was the challenge of seeing [its] potential... because of the limitations of the robot itself,"" he told Military.com. ""They took it as it was: a loud robot that's going to give away their position."" Gas powered The machine, which has a gas-powered engine, is said to emit a lawnmower-like noise that would be unviable in combat situations. It is also thought to be difficult to repair. In response, Boston Dynamics did create a quieter, electric-powered alternative, called Spot. But despite successful trials in September 2015, the Marines have decided not to take it forward either. This, they said, was because Spot is smaller, can only carry up to 40lbs, and lacks the automation capacity of the LS3. Google said as far back as 2013 that it planned to move away from its military contracts, which it inherited as part of its acquisition of the company. Face saving The tech firm has said it intends to develop robots for use in manufacturing and industry instead. Noel Sharkey, co-director of the Foundation for Responsible Robotics, told the BBC: ""Spot ... lacks the autonomous operation of Big Dog, but that really is not so much of a problem and would not require a vast amount of research. ""The problem is that to take the extra steps need to upgrade the battery-driven Spot to the level of Big Dog could require a couple of years development or more and thus a new Darpa contract. ""So, what this looks like is a face saving statement by the Marine Corps to make it look like they are dumping Google/Boston Dynamics before they they got dumped themselves.""","The US army says it has mothballed plans to deploy a robot developed in conjunction with Google because it is ""too loud""."
"Like many modern runners, the former French national team member uses technology as a key element in helping him hit a new personal best. Gadgets are as essential a part of a runner's kit as the shoes on their feet. Few head out these days without a step counter, GPS watch, smartphone or smartwatch. The wearables keep an eye on the distance covered, pace, heart rate and cadence - helping to ensure they get as much out of the session as possible. ""I'm a scientist as well as a runner so when I want data I want to get reliable data,"" said Mr Adam. Unfortunately, he said, many wearables do not gather data accurately. One study by consumer group Which? suggested many fitness trackers underestimated the distance runners cover - with the least accurate adding unnecessary miles to a long run. ""You can get data with a GPS watch but you do not know how the algorithm is made or its accuracy,"" he said. ""If you want to analyse the data, it needs to be available to you."" In a bid to manage his workouts better, Mr Adam is now trialling a wearable that has emerged from medical research. Called GaitUp, the sensor has been developed by Dr Benoit Mariani, based on his work on spotting the early signs of degenerative diseases such as Parkinson's. 'Our sixth vital sign' These physical signs, says Dr Mariani, make themselves felt in very subtle ways long before standard tests can catch them. ""If you have a muscle weakness or neurological disorder it will be reflected in your gait first,"" he said. ""Those signs have been under the radar because there's been no easy tool to measure them."" Changes in the way people walk can be as revealing as those seen in other recognised markers of bodily health - heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature, respiration rate and oxygen saturation. ""Gait is our sixth vital sign,"" he said. The sensor developed by Dr Mariani's engineering team does more than just measure steps. It can capture rear and forefoot strike angles, as well as the amount of time each foot is in contact with the ground. ""We're interested in the quality of the gait,"" he said. He is not the only one. Researchers are keen to get better data about the way elite athletes run, says sports scientist Dr Yannis Pitsiladis from the University of Brighton. He is part of the long-term Sub2Hrs research project that aims to develop the training methods, techniques and technology that will help a runner set a recognised world record for running the marathon in under two hours. On 12 October this year, Kenyan running great Eliud Kipchoge broke that barrier but the help he got, from a phalanx of pace-setters and an electric vehicle, meant it was not recognised as a world record. 'Asymmetries and quirks' ""To break the sub-two hour barrier, you need to get everything right,"" Dr Pitsiladis told the BBC. ""You need to identify the right athlete, right weather conditions, right track and also you need bio-energetics,"" he said. Making sure the minimal amount of energy is expended at each step of the marathon will be key, he said. ""The more economical you are, the more you can maintain that pace until the end of the race. ""Anything you do to make you more economical, whether it is the shoe, or the data, or the terrain you are running on being 1% or 2% or 3% better will have a huge impact on your performance,"" he said. It took an improvement of less than 0.5% for Kipchoge to shift his fastest marathon time below the two-hour mark. Improving by 1% or more would mean smashing the barrier. ""With these kinds of athletes, I would argue that we have not got the best out of them yet,"" said Dr Pitsiladis. ""There's not a lot of science in their training and a lot of these athletes train themselves."" There was ample room for improvement, such as refining their stride pattern or pacing, he said. Sensors are now so small that they can be worn during a race without becoming a burden. Until now, most analysis of pace and performance has happened on a treadmill or after an event but this does not really capture what an athlete undergoes while racing, said Dr Pitsiladis. For instance, treadmills can exaggerate the way a foot rolls during each step and give a false sense of how a runner moves. After-the-event analysis of the way a runner moves during a race or training run is useful, he said, but it would be better to do it as they are running and adjust as they go. Mr Adam used GaitUp to prepare for the New York City marathon and it helped him become the fastest French finisher in that race, hitting a time of 2h 26m. Running coach Sam Murphy questioned whether the information provided by sensors such as GaitUp was too comprehensive. ""What are you actually going to do about the information that tells you your left foot externally rotates more than your right?"" she asked. ""Or that your take-off angle is too flat?"" Many elite athletes such as Haile Gebrselassie and Paula Radcliffe had ""asymmetries"" and ""quirks"", she said, suggesting the body can work around the disadvantages physiology or upbringing may have imposed on them. Also, she added, given that runners typically take about 10,000 strides per hour, altering each foot strike to make it perfect could be difficult. But she conceded that having ""greater awareness"" of how people run and what they do when they run was undoubtedly useful. Steady improvement was all about acting on feedback, said Ms Murphy. ""Sometimes getting that data or feedback internally may be more impactful than from an external source such as these devices,"" she said. ""We aren't machines, we're way, way smarter than that.""","Runner Guillaume Adam wants to go faster, further and for longer."

"By Jen CopestakeBBC Click But the Zaatari refugee camp near the Syrian border in Jordan houses a vibrant community of makers. The majority of the residents are from the Syrian city of Daraa, commonly called the cradle of the revolution for the role it played in early anti-government protests. The camp was formed four years ago when people fled the war across the border. Now, more than 80,000 people are estimated to live in Zaatari. Despite the incredible hardships many have faced, there is a vibrant entrepreneurial spirit here. The camp's main street is called Sham Elysees. It's a play on ash-Sham - a word Syrians call Damascus - and the famous Parisian boulevard, Champs Elysees. Hundreds of shops line the street, covering everything from wedding dresses to mobile phone repair shops. It's here we meet disabled inventor Sawfan Harb who has lived in Zaatari for three years. He fled Syria with two family members, who are also disabled. Sawfan found it difficult living in the camp when he first arrived as many roads were not paved and he didn't want to rely on people to push or carry him in his wheelchair. He discussed with his brother the possibility of creating an electric bike out of spare parts in the camp. With the help of a local welder his plans were brought to life. ""Because of my disability I'm forced to be creative and find ways to help me live my life as easily as possible, be it in Syria or here, it's the same,"" he says. ""People were at first surprised to see such a bike in the camp. They've never seen anything like it before. Some liked it, others were just surprised."" Of course, there are many barriers to refugees living in the camp accessing technology. Electricity is only on for half the day in the camp and money is in short supply. Safwan would like to enhance his technical skills with academic courses. ""If possible I would like to study technology because I have ideas but I need academic learning,"" he says. ""I have other ideas but I have no support, even a simple idea needs a certain amount of money."" Biometric checks Syrian refugees entering Jordan have their irises scanned by the UNHCR (UN High Commissioner for Refugees) using IrisGuard technology. This biometric data is collected to confirm identities but also provides services from local partners to help make life a bit more normal for refugees. This includes the Cairo Amman Bank, which is linked to the biometric database and sets up an account automatically for each family. A nominated family member can take aid money out in the blink of an eye at bank machines. There is no need to register information again with the bank as it comes through the UNHCR's secure EyeCloud server based in Amman. The data is also shared between four countries: Egypt, Jordan Lebanon and Iraq, to ensure people aren't registered in two countries at the same time. More refugees live in Jordan's capital Amman than in refugee camps. Finding ways to integrate them into Jordanian society and provide access to technology is the focus of a group of companies and philanthropists called Refugee OpenWare. Its focus is on how to deploy advanced technologies to improve human rights in conflict zones and host communities for refugees. In a modern office park full of start-ups is 3Dmena, a core member of the group which mainly works on fabrication technologies, including 3D printing. A row of Ultimaker printers lines one wall of its office; a machine the company is trying to convert to 3D-print food sits in the corner. ""We focus on advanced technologies like 3D printing, internet-of-things, robotics, virtual reality and how we engage physical and traditional industries in digital fabrication,"" says 3Dmena's co-founder Loay Malahmeh. Mr Malahmeh also reaches out to Syrian refugees to work at his company. Asem Hasna worked as a paramedic driving an ambulance in Syria. He lost his left leg in a bomb explosion. He was working in a traditional prosthetic centre in Amman when he saw one of 3Dmena's 3D printers the team had brought to the hospital for a fitting. Within three weeks Mr Hasna became proficient in 3D printing and hacked the printer to print in a material it hadn't been able to before. He even taught people from Jordan's Royal Rehabilitation Hospital how to use it. He became 3Dmena's technical director. One of the devices Mr Hasna created was an echolocation device using haptic feedback. It buzzes the hand of a Syrian refugee who was blinded by a sniper, helping to alert him to objects in his way so he can walk more confidently. The solutions they are printing are relatively inexpensive, which could help provide cheaper prosthetic solutions to people with little money. Mr Hasna's prosthetic foot needs a rubber element to be replaced twice a year which usually costs around $35 (£25). But with the printer he could manufacture the part in a flexible material in under 30 minutes for just $1.50. Besides training refugees who are living in Amman, 3Dmena hopes to bring a fabrication lab with different computer controlled machines - including wood-working, metal workshops and 3D printers - directly to the refugee camp. Mr Malahmeh hired a professor of conflict studies to do research in Zaatari over a period of two months, conducting more than 270 surveys and 65 focus groups. More than 95% of respondents said they felt having a platform for 3D printing in Zaatari would have a big impact. More than 45% said they would use it at least three times a week to solve problems relating to shelter, transport, electricity, sanitation and food production systems. But for now, 3Dmena is focused on setting up operations in Turkey and Gaza. ""Unfortunately we received a rejection letter due to a lot of security issues, so the project in Zaatari is on hold,"" says Mr Malahmeh. ""But hopefully, if we get approval, we can do it.""

"The agreement - with the World Federation of Advertisers (WFA) - will see the social networks use common definitions for things such as hate speech, aggression and bullying. Brands will also have better tools to control where their ads appear. It follows an advertising boycott of Facebook earlier this year, involving more than 1,000 companies. The boycott included some of the world's biggest brands - such as Unilever and Coca-Cola. It was driven in part by the Stop Hate for Profit campaign, a coalition of non-profit organisations urging brands to pull advertising to encourage radical reform of Facebook's hate speech policies. But this latest agreement is between the advertisers themselves and the social networks, and does not involve the non-profit groups. It is also specifically about advertising - content policies do not need to change, and decisions about what to take down remain separate. But the US Anti-Defamation League, responding on behalf of Stop Hate for Profit, gave a cautious welcome to the ""early step"". ""These social media platforms have finally committed to doing a better job tracking and auditing hateful content,"" chief executive Jonathan Greenblatt said. But he warned that the deal must be followed through, ""to ensure they are not the kind of empty promises that we have seen too often from Facebook"" - and he said his group would continue to push for further change. Rob Rakowtiz from the WFA said the agreement ""sets a boundary on content that absolutely should have no ads supporting it, therefore removing harmful content and bad actors from receiving funding from legitimate advertising."" Independent audits The details are being set by a group established by the WFA, called the Global Alliance for Responsible Media (Garm). It was set up in 2019, long before the boycott, to create a ""responsible digital environment"", and it says the new deal is the result of 15 months of negotiations. Garm will decide the definitions for harmful content, setting what it calls ""a common baseline"", rather than the current situation where they ""vary by platform"". That makes it difficult for brands to choose where to place their adverts, it said. The group will also create what it calls ""harmonised reporting"" methodologies, so that statistics on harmful content can be compared between platforms. By 2021, there will be ""a set of harmonised metrics on issues around platform safety, advertiser safety, platform effectiveness in addressing harmful content,"" it said. Independent audits will double-check the figures. And, crucially for advertisers, the new deal calls for control over how close an advert will appear to certain types of content. ""Advertisers need to have visibility and control so that their advertising does not appear adjacent to harmful or unsuitable content, and take corrective action if necessary and to be able to do so quickly,"" it explained. All three social networks publicly welcomed the agreement. None, however, said they were making any immediate changes to their wider content policies.","Facebook, YouTube and Twitter have agreed a deal with major advertisers on how they define harmful content."
"By Carl MillerBBC Click ""Eventually, these scum will release something truly nasty to wipe us all out, but first they have to train us to be obedient slaves"" reads another. A third: ""Coronavirus is the newest Islamist weapon."" Many of us by now will have seen something of the ""infodemic"" the World Health Organization (WHO) warned is swirling across society. Whether popping into your online timeline or maybe forwarded by a relative, it would have been a rumour or revelation so eye-grabbing, so shockingly different from the norm, that they're hard to ignore. Yet while false claims about coronavirus have been hard to miss, the interests and ideologies underneath them have been far less visible. Now, a co-investigation by BBC Click and the UK counter-extremism think-tank Institute of Strategic Dialogue, indicates how both extremist political and fringe medical communities have tried to exploit the pandemic online. Blaming immigration Chloe Colliver led the study: ""We started doing this research because we were interested to look at the intersection of extremism and disinformation online,"" she explained. ""We wanted to know how the coronavirus crisis was affecting those trends."" First, researchers collected about 150,000 public Facebook posts sent by 38 far-right groups and pages since January. They used keywords to spot the key themes of each post, and then algorithms to map what each group tended to speak about overall. Researchers identified five communities, united by the topic of discussion: The numbers, probably indicative rather than giving the full picture, show that for the first four of these, the scale of activity hadn't increased in volume since the lockdown. But while there weren't more posts about immigration, for example, discussions about the topic had increasingly linked it to Covid-19. It's the same for the theme of Islam - the scale was constant, but more and more of the discussion had begun to explicitly link the virus to Muslims, claiming they were exempt from the lockdown, blaming them for its spread, and even hoping they would catch it. But the fifth and largest community - the one concerning the ""elites"" - had shown a significant spike in activity during the lockdown. Discussions included the relationship of these ""elites"" - like Jeff Bezos, the Rothschilds, George Soros and Bill Gates - to the ""deep state"", and their alleged role in causing the pandemic. The researchers discovered that along with tying it to ""elites"", this community was more likely than any other to think the virus was engineered, over-hyped, or had an existing cure. ""This was the big shift,"" Colliver explained. ""Anti-elite conversations have escalated dramatically, especially driving home the idea the lockdown is a tool of social control."" 'Humungous scale' As they dug deeper into the posts, the researchers took note of many thousands of links directing users to fringe political and health websites. Newsguard, a website-rating organisation, had identified 34 of them as having shared information about the coronavirus that was ""materially false"". ""The key interests behind these websites were either fringe politics or fringe health, sometimes both wrapped up together"" Ms Colliver continued. What was surprising to the researchers, however, was the size: ""The scale was humungous"". They counted the total number of ""interactions"" - likes, shares, comments, and so on - which each public post on Facebook had received which contained a link to any of these 34 sites. Over the same time period: The 34 websites together received more than 80 million interactions. These included: ""Interactions"" do not imply agreement, and they were counted for each website overall, not exclusively for misinformation regarding coronavirus. ""We have removed a number of links shared by BBC Click for violating our policies on hate speech and the spread of harmful misinformation,"" Facebook said in response to the study. ""Where a post does not violate our policies but is deemed by third party fact-checkers to be false, we reduce its distribution and show warning labels marking the post as false. When people see these warning labels, 95% of the time they do not go on to view the original content,"" it said. Growing threat There are also plenty of other ways for the CDC and WHO to get their information out to audiences. Recent research by the UK watchdog Ofcom suggests that most people learn about the virus from mainstream sources. However, what the WHO has called an ""infodemic"" looks more like a parallel world, complete with social organisation, activism and gift shops. It is one where fringe politics and fringe health have begun to mix. They both carry the idea that the lockdown isn't about safety but about control, which they promise to ""liberate"" their followers from.

"The controls will automatically be set to ""on"" for new users. Customers who do not want the service will have to actively choose not to turn it on. The filter is designed to block sites deemed unsuitable for children. The move comes after the government called for internet service providers to filter legal pornography and other adult subjects ""by default"". The BT Parental Controls filter will cover any internet-enabled device connected to its home broadband service. The implementation of the controls will be pre-selected for new users who are setting up their internet connection for the first time. They will have to confirm this option and then will be asked to set a filter level. There will be three levels - strict, moderate and light - or customers can choose to turn the filter off. Existing users of BT's broadband will be contacted during 2014 and asked to make a decision on whether or not they want to set up the new service. Search blocked Sites that show pornography, refer to illegal drugs or promote self-harm will all be blocked. Other categories of sites that the filter can be set to block include nudity, social networking and gaming. Users can also personalise the filters to block access to sex-education sites and search engines. BT currently has 6.8 million broadband customers. ""BT takes the issue of online child protection extremely seriously and we are very pleased to be able to launch the whole-home filter to help parents keep their families safe online,"" said BT's managing director of consumer commercial marketing and digital, Pete Oliver. The National Crime Agency's Child Exploitation and Online Protection Command (CEOP) said it welcomed the move by BT. The government has said by the end of 2014, 20 million homes - 95% of all homes in Britain with an existing internet connection - will be required to choose whether to switch on a whole-home ""family- friendly"" internet filter. Sky and Talk Talk have already implemented their own version of a ""family-friendly"" filter. Virgin is expected to introduce something similar in the new year. In November, Google and Microsoft announced that 100,000 search terms that related to illegal material would be blocked by their search engines.",BT has announced the launch of a new internet filter designed to protect children online.
"It comes in response to a court case brought by Amazon Web Services (AWS), claiming the decision was politically motivated. President Trump had previously expressed concern about Amazon's bid. In a court filing, the Pentagon said the U-turn was ""in response to.... technical challenges presented by AWS"". Microsoft said it ""remained confident"" its bid was ""technologically superior"". In a statement, it said: ""We believe the Department of Defense made the correct decision when they awarded the contract. ""However, we support their decision to reconsider a small number of factors as it is likely the fastest way to resolve all issues and quickly provide the needed modern technology to people across our armed forces."" Amazon said it was pleased that the DoD had acknowledged the ""substantial and legitimate issues"" with the award decision. The Pentagon has requested 120 days to reassess the award - its filing was based on pricing and not whether President Trump had interfered in the process. In July last year, President Trump began questioning whether the process was fair, telling reporters he was getting ""tremendous complaints about the contract with the Pentagon and Amazon"". He has previously criticised Amazon founder Jeff Bezos - who owns the Washington Post. Only Microsoft and Amazon bid for the Joint Enterprise Defence Infrastructure (Jedi) contract and the latter had been seen as the favourite to win. The new system is designed to replace the DoD's ageing computer networks with a single cloud system, which will host classified secrets and provide artificial intelligence-based analysis to the military. In October, following a delay, the contract was awarded to Microsoft. A month later Amazon began an appeal over the decision, saying: ""Numerous aspects of the Jedi evaluation process contained clear deficiencies, errors and unmistakable bias - and it's important that these matters be examined and rectified.""","The US Department of Defense is to ""reconsider"" its decision to award a multi-billion dollar cloud contract to Microsoft over Amazon."
"By Chris BaraniukTechnology reporter The new option is called UberWav and will be available, the company says, ""at the push of a button"" at the same cost as cheaper UberX fares. Recently, Brighton councillors considering whether to grant Uber a licence questioned options for wheelchair users. Accessibility charities were involved in the new service's development. Scope, Whizz-Kidz and Transport for All are supporting the launch of UberWav, and Uber says it is investing more than £1m over the first 18 months to establish the product. The vehicles will be equipped with a rear-entry ramp, winch and restraints, allowing wheelchair users to travel with one additional passenger. An Uber spokesman said the company was initially providing 55 vehicles in the new fleet but planned to expand this to more than 100 ""in the coming months"". He added Uber expected wait times of ""around 25 minutes"" in Zones 1-2 and ""40 minutes"" in Zones 3-4 during the first few weeks. ""We're proud to be making one of the biggest ever investments in accessible private hire in London and will be working hard to keep waiting times as low as possible as the service expands,"" said Tom Elvidge, Uber's general manager in London. 'Right step' The service is ""a step in the right direction"" according to Ruth Owen, chief executive of Whizz-Kidz. ""This new initiative will give disabled people in London a much-needed additional option for planning their travel across the capital,"" she added. In the past, Uber has faced criticism for not offering wheelchair accessible vehicles in more cities. Recently, the company settled a court case in California after its drivers were accused of turning away passengers with guide dogs. London is currently the only UK location in which UberWav has been made available. ""London [black] cabs have always been easier to access because of their big doors and the space where seats flap up at the back,"" said Prof Tony Travers, at the London School of Economics. ""I think Uber in London were under more pressure because their main competitors had an advantage,"" he told the BBC. But Uber may soon be met with added scrutiny from London's newly elected Mayor. Sadiq Khan focused on public transport issues during his campaign - and dealt with the issue of Uber during an LBC radio phone-in. Mr Khan told a black-cab driver he felt it had been a ""mistake"" that Transport for London (TfL) had allowed Uber taxis ""to come on stream"". Cab-comparison rival A rival, Karhoo, also launched in London this week. The app allows travellers to compare and book licensed taxis and private hire vehicles - from black cabs to executive cars. Karhoo has said it will give users access to more than 30,000 vehicles in London. Passengers will be able to make multiple bookings and be given a final price at the time of booking. Unlike Uber, there will also be no surge pricing during peak periods. ""Karhoo gives passengers more choice and transparency when booking a cab and, with our ever-growing network of local operators, Karhoo will make it easier to book a ride outside central London than ever before,"" said Karhoo chief executive and founder Daniel Ishag. ""It's evidence, lest we need it, that Uber really was a positive disruptive element in the market,"" said Prof Travers. ""It shows how successful market innovation can drive further innovation.""",Uber has launched a fleet of wheelchair-accessible vehicles that can be requested via the app.
"By Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent The Iranian group - codenamed OilRig - had its operations compromised by a Russian-based group known as Turla. The Russians piggybacked on the Iranian group to target other victims. A National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) investigation, begun in 2017 into an attack on a UK academic institution, uncovered the double-dealing. Crowded space The NCSC discovered that the attack on the institution had been carried out by the Russian Turla group, which it realised was scanning for capabilities and tools used by Iran-based OilRig. In an investigation that lasted months, it became clear the Russian group had targeted the Iranian-based group and then used its tools and access to collect data and compromise further systems. Attacks were discovered against more than 35 countries with the majority of the victims being in the Middle East. At least 20 were successfully compromised. The ambition was to steal secrets, and documents were taken from a number of targets, including governments. Intelligence agencies said Turla was both getting hold of information the Iranians were stealing but also running their own operations using Iranian access and then hoping it would hide their tracks. Victims might have assumed they had been compromised by the Iranian-based group when in fact the real culprit was based in Russia. There is no evidence that Iran was complicit or aware of the Russians' use of their access or that the activity was done to foment trouble between countries but is a sign of the increasingly complex world of cyber-operations. ""This is getting to be a very crowded space,"" explained Paul Chichester, director of operations for the NCSC, the protective arm of the intelligence agency GCHQ. He adding he had not previously seen such a sophisticated attack carried out. Separately it has been reported in leaks that the US and UK also have similar capabilities. Mr Chichester said he would not describe the Russian hack attacks as a ""false flag"" since it was not an attempt to deliberately frame someone else. The NCSC would also not directly attribute the attacks to the Russian and Iranian states but Turla has previously been linked by others to Russia's Security Service, the FSB, and OilRig to the Iranian state. 'We can identify them' The investigation was primarily a UK one but the details are being revealed jointly by the NCSC and America's NSA. A report of Turla compromising another espionage group was made by the private security company Symantec in June. Mr Chichester said the purpose of revealing the details was to help others detect this activity and defend themselves. ""We want to send a clear message that even when cyber-actors seek to mask their identity, our capabilities are a match for them and we can identify them,"" he said. How the two groups will react to the exposure is not something officials said they could predict.","An Iranian hacking group was itself hacked by a Russian group to spy on multiple countries, UK and US intelligence agencies have revealed."
"Targets hit in the mass defacement included government sites, its official agencies, trade groups and many others. A message put on the hacked sites said the attack was carried out to protest against the Chinese government's strict control of its citizens. It urged Chinese people to join Anonymous and stage their own protests against the regime. Attack pattern The announcement about the defacements was made via anAnonymous Chinaaccount that was established in March.A list of the 485 sites affected wasput on the Pastebin website. Separate Pastebin messages posted email addresses and other personal details stolen when sites were penetrated. Sites defaced had the same message posted to them that chided the nation's government for its repressive policies. It read: ""Dear Chinese government, you are not infallible, today websites are hacked, tomorrow it will be your vile regime that will fall."" China has one of the most comprehensive web surveillance systems in the world, known as the Great Firewall of China, that reinforces its broader social controls. The system polices where Chinese people can go online and tries to restrict what they can talk about. On defaced pages, the Anonymous attackers also posted links to advice that could help people avoid official scrutiny of what they do and say online. Much of the advice was in English so it is unclear how much help it would be. There has been no official confirmation of the defacements. News wires reported that government officials had denied any had taken place. However, many of the sites listed are now offline and a few others displayed a hacked page for a long time rather than their own homepage. The Anonymous hackers reportedly successfullyattacked some sites a second time once the original defacement was cleaned up.",The Anonymous hacking group claims to have defaced almost 500 websites in China.
"By Zoe KleinmanTechnology reporter, Las Vegas Danish free-diving champion Stig Severinsen, who holds the world record for holding his breath under water, is perhaps an unlikely attendee at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. A passionate biologist who also studied medicine, Mr Severinsen, whose breath-holding record is 22 minutes, is in Nevada this week with a firm called Masimo as they launch a new wearable health-monitoring device, the MightySat. As perhaps an ""extreme user"" of such tech, Mr Severinsen told the BBC that the benefits of wearable devices outweighed the security risks of storing the often very personal data they collected. Health-monitoring tech looks set to be a big trend at CES this year, and there are plenty of devices here designed to track and collate your vital signs. Unlike the more conventional wristband design, the Masimo model fits on the end of the user's fingertip and measures oxygen saturation as well as blood flow and pulse. Mr Severinsen decided to use the MightySat after testing two other monitoring devices, which he declined to name. He did admit that they were not robust enough to survive in the extreme conditions in which he dives. One of his recent exploits involved swimming underneath an iceberg, and while he wasn't wearing the devices during the swim itself, the conditions on the surface were too cold for them to function, he believes. ""Training for extreme records under extreme conditions is always a huge challenge,"" he said. ""In such situations, it is of great value to be able to perform non-invasive and accurate measurements of my heart rate and oxygen saturation levels with a state-of-the-art device."" ""Understanding what goes on inside your body is paramount to improving performance."" Security issues The so-called quantified-self movement aims to incorporate technology and data collection into people's daily routines. By keeping track of your health, the theory goes, you can also keep one step ahead of falling ill. Mr Severinsen believes that health monitoring has the potential to shift the focus of medicine more in the direction of preventing illness rather than the current method of treating conditions as they arise, ""fighting fires"" as he calls it. ""Very little is done in terms of prevention,"" he told the BBC. Privacy experts remain concerned about how the firms that sell wearables make sure that the sensitive data they collect remains private. Much of the data collected by health monitors including MightySat tends to be stored in the cloud. Despite some high profile cloud data thefts in the past 12 months, Mr Severinsen remains relaxed about security issues. ""I wouldn't mind people stealing my heart rate data,"" he said. ""I've never had that Big Brother fear. You can do bad things with anything."" Masimo is very quick to point out that MightySat's data is encrypted. ""I'm not worried about security settings - nothing is safe in this world,"" Mr Severinsen added. Mental barrier The internet is the only platform he uses for all his work teaching his own ""breathology"" technique to corporate and private clients around the world. ""I move around all the time - I just want things to be accessible when they're needed,"" he said. Mr Severinsen has trained himself over the years to hold his breath ""comfortably"" in the water for at least five or six minutes. He admitted suffering black-outs, falls and even coughing up blood while perfecting his technique. ""The real challenge is the mental barrier - the urge to breathe,"" he explained. ""Breathing is the reflex of life, the strongest signal. You get through it with knowledge, learning to relax through the panic."" The desire to breathe stemmed not from a need for more oxygen but to expel carbon dioxide, Mr Severinsen added. And if you've ever wondered what it feels like to get beyond that urge. ""Your heart rate drops… sometimes you get the urge to pee… and your heart starts to secrete hormones,"" he said. ""You don't want to think about time. The notion of time dissolves.""",What is a man whose expertise lies in his ability to hold his breath doing at the world's largest gadget fair? Zoe Kleinman finds out.
"By Zoe KleinmanTechnology reporter, BBC News Its cute penguin symbol is as familiar to Chinese children as the McDonalds ""golden arches"" logo is to children in the West, says the BBC's China media analyst Kerry Allen. ""Tencent is thought of as so much more than just a Chinese company in China - it has gained a reputation as a family-friendly organisation that connects families, friends and work colleagues in a digital age,"" she said. ""It has a business model that other Chinese companies can only envy - it can reach an audience of, basically, everyone."" But many people in the West have never heard of it. That doesn't mean it isn't present in our everyday lives, though - Tencent also owns chunks of some of Western culture's most popular games, music and movies. WeChat Like Google's parent company, Alphabet, Tencent has a broad portfolio of interests, although arguably it remains best known for its messaging services. US president Donald Trump singled out the app WeChat in his most recent executive order, which demands US firms stop doing business with it. WeChat has over a billion users, both inside China and around the world - the Chinese version is called Weixin. It is often compared to WhatsApp - and certainly it is widely used for messaging - several US messaging apps and social media sites are banned by the Chinese state so you can't (officially) Facebook message a friend in Beijing, for example. But there's a lot more to WeChat than messaging. It's more akin to a separate operating system: just like you might use Google's Android or Apple's iOS for a variety of tasks, it is used to read news, pay bills, order transport or food, and run small businesses. The firm has not revealed just how profitable WeChat is on its own, but it is clear that Tencent - as a whole - is thriving. Earning results for the first quarter of 2020 showed a total revenue of 108 billion Chinese yuan ($15.2 billion) - an increase of 26% year-on-year, despite the coronavirus pandemic. Alphabet's revenue for the same period was $41.2 bn. Crunchbase's Tencent entry lists 479 investments, with a fund totalling $6.6bn. It would be tedious to go through them all, but let's take a quick look at some of them. Gaming It is clear that Tencent makes a lot of money via gaming. Tencent is the largest video games publisher in the world. It has a stake in the two most popular Battle Royale-style games: Fortnite and PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PubG). It owns a 40% stake in Fortnite studio, Epic games, and has the license to PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PubG) - although it failed in its own battle to get the game approved for distribution in China. It also owns the entire League of Legends studio, Riot Games. In October 2019, PC Gamer published a list of 16 games firms outside of China that Tencent had publicly invested in, including Ubisoft and Discord. Music and movies It also invests in Western music and films. Tencent has recently completed a deal giving it a 10% stake in Universal Music. The record label includes major artists such as Lady Gaga, Taylor Swift, Drake and Kendrick Lamar on its books. In addition, Tencent already has its own music division - Tencent Music Entertainment (TME). And a share-swap in 2017 saw it take a 7.5% stake in streaming giant Spotify (Spotify got 9.5% of TME in return, reported Tech Crunch at the time). Tencent Pictures, its film and production arm, has been involved in a large number of Hollywood movies, including Terminator: Dark Fate (2019), Wonder Woman (2017) and the upcoming Top Gun sequel, Top Gun: Maverick - scheduled for release in 2021. Oh - and there's also the small matter of the Chinese giant owning 5% of the US electric car firm Tesla. What is the US concerned about? President Donald Trump says that the spread in the US of mobile apps developed and owned by Chinese firms ""threaten the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States"". The US government says both Bytedance's TikTok and Tencent's WeChat ""capture vast swaths of information from its users"". ""This data collection threatens to allow the Chinese Communist Party access to Americans' personal and proprietary information,"" it claims. Tencent's chief executive and co-founder Ma Huateng, known as Pony Ma, is widely assumed to support the Communist Party. He is a member of the National People's Congress (NPC), China's national parliament. Trump's executive order also claims both WeChat and TikTok gather data on Chinese nationals visiting the US, allowing Beijing ""to keep tabs"" on them. Prof Alan Woodward, a cyber security expert from Surrey University, points out that for international users, WeChat data sits on servers outside of China - meaning in theory that it is more protected from state scrutiny. However, he added that WeChat's privacy policy openly states that it will ""comply with any legal requests from state agencies to hand over data they have in their servers"". ""Just as with TikTok, the concern is that the parent company is Chinese and thus it may be argued that they are indeed subject to the Chinese Intelligence Act,"" he said. Tencent has so far issued the briefest of responses to the news from the US: ""We are reviewing the executive order to get a full understanding,"" it said.","Based in Shenzhen and founded in 1998, the Chinese company Tencent enjoys huge popularity - and profits - in China."
"By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor The April 2018 goal to protect under-18s was revealed as digital minister Matt Hancock signed the commencement order for the Digital Economy Act, which introduces the requirement. But details as to how the scheme will work have yet to be finalised. Experts who advised ministers said the targeted date seemed ""unrealistic"". The act also sets out other new laws including punishing the use of bots to snatch up scores of concert tickets, and mandating the provision of subtitles on catch-up TV. Credit cards The age-check requirement applies to any website or other online platform that provides pornography ""on a commercial basis"" to people in the UK. It allows a regulator to fine any business that refuses to comply and to ask third-party payment services to withdraw support. The watchdog will also be able to force internet providers to block access to non-compliant services. Ministers have suggested one of several ways this might work would be for pornographic sites to demand credit card details before providing any access, since in the UK consumers typically have to be over 18 to have a card of their own. But the specifics are being left to the as-yet unappointed regulator to determine. While it has been proposed that the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) will assume this role, a spokesman for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport said the appointment would not be formalised until the autumn. ""We are already working closely with DCMS to ensure the effective implementation of the act,"" a spokeswoman for the BBFC told the BBC, but added that it was too early to say more about what guidance it might issue. 'Premature date' The measure has been welcomed by child protection charities including Childnet. ""Protecting children from exposure, including accidental exposure, to adult content is incredibly important, given the effect it can have on young people,"" said its chief executive Will Gardner. ""Steps like this help restrict access."" Mindgeek, which operates several of the world's most popular porn sites, has also previously indicated support. But two experts who advised the government on its plans have expressed reservations about both how quickly the scheme is being rolled out and its wider implications. ""It seems to me to be a very premature date,"" commented Dr Victoria Nash, lead author of a report commissioned in the run-up to the law being drafted. ""The idea you can get a regulatory body up and running in that timeframe seems extraordinary to me. ""And while I don't have a problem with asking these companies to act responsibly, I don't see it as a solution to stopping minors seeing pornography."" This, she explained, was because the act does not tackle the fact that services including Twitter and Tumblr contain hardcore pornography but will not be required to introduce age-checks. Nor, she added, would teens be prevented from sharing copied photos and clips among themselves. ""It may make it harder for children to stumble across pornography, especially in the younger age range, but it will do nothing to stop determined teenagers,"" Dr Nash concluded. One cyber-security expert on the same advisory panel was more critical. ""The timeline is unrealistic - but beyond that, this is one of the worst proposals I have seen on digital strategy,"" said Dr Joss Wright from the Oxford Internet Institute. ""There are hundreds of thousands of websites where this material can be accessed and you are not going to catch all of those. ""There's privacy issues - you're requiring people to effectively announce the fact they are looking at this material to the credit card authorities. ""And there's serious security issues from requiring people to enter their credit card details into untrusted sites. ""They may well say there will be other magical ways to do the age check, but I very much doubt they will be non-discriminatory [against adults without credit cards], transparent, privacy-preserving and secure for end-users."" Bot bashing Other topics covered by the act on which work can now formally begin include: Some provisions set out by the act have already come into force, including the introduction of a ""broadband universal service obligation"" to give households the right to request download speeds of at least 10 megabits per second, and increased fines for firms behind nuisance calls. ""The Digital Economy Act is about building a strong, safe and connected economy,"" said Mr Hancock. ""It will secure better support for consumers, better protection for children on the internet, and underpin a radical transformation of government services.""",A nine-month countdown to the introduction of compulsory age checks on online pornography seen from the UK has begun.
"By Chris BaraniukTechnology reporter The aim is to develop an algorithm that can automatically differentiate between healthy and cancerous tissues. This ""segmentation"" is necessary in patients with head and neck cancers. And it is hoped the time it takes to design targeted radiotherapy treatments could be cut from four hours to one. ""Clinicians will remain responsible for deciding radiotherapy treatment plans,"" UCLH said. Complex tumours ""From my perspective, one of the challenges that we have in the treatment of all tumours, but particularly brain and neck [tumours], is their complexity,"" said Dr Kieran Breen, of Brain Tumour Research, who is not involved in the work. ""One way we can really improve this is by using the knowledge we already have,"" he told the BBC. ""This is essentially what this project is doing."" More precise radiotherapy helps reduce side effects of such treatment, according to Dr Justine Alford, senior science information officer at Cancer Research UK. ""Using computers to help plan radiotherapy could help deliver better treatment for patients by speeding up the process and improving accuracy,"" she said. ""But we won't know until results from this innovative new project are produced."" The former patients have consented to their anonymised scans being used for medical research. Ownership of the data will be retained by the hospital. And, at the end of the partnership, DeepMind will ""securely destroy"" any information provided to it.

"The Committee of Advertising Practice (CAP) says companies that breach its guidelines will be referred to the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). Three clinics had ads banned last week after suggesting vitamin-drip therapy offered protection against the disease. NHS England has previously criticised companies for peddling fake remedies. Its guidelines state companies must not make direct or indirect claims IV drips can treat or prevent viral conditions such as coronavirus. No treatments have yet been approved by the MHRA for Covid-19, meaning companies cannot make medical claims relating to it for any products. Matt Wilson, public affairs manager at the Advertising Standards Agency (ASA), told BBC News: ""We're contacting other businesses who offer these treatments and directing them to remove any Covid-19-related claims from their websites and social-media pages. ""We'll be monitoring to check they're following the rules. Any that don't will face sanctions."" The ASA's powers are limited to demanding ads must not be repeated. It cannot issue its own penalties and its judgements are sometimes ignored. By contrast, if the MHRA judges an offender to be non-compliant, they may be subject to prosecution and, if found guilty, could face an unlimited fine and/or up to six months' imprisonment. IV clinics, or lounges as they are sometimes called, are being set up all over the world, often promoted by celebrities. In the UK, there are at least 17 dedicated IV lounges and 2,500 private clinics that offer IV therapy among other treatments. Clients tend to be people aged under 35 who pay to have blends of saline, vitamins and enzymes infused directly into a vein.",Online ads promoting intravenous drips that make false claims related to Covid-19 face prosecution by the state.
"People expressed concern on social media that it would mean contact data was not being uploaded and users would not receive exposure notifications. Google reassured users no data had been lost. The issue affected other countries' track and trace apps too. Users were told not to clear storage in their app, despite some people suggesting that might be a fix. Rather than solve the problem, that may cause a loss of data and matches from the period the app was not working, according to Google. In some cases, apps stuck on the loading page could be kick-started by rebooting the phone. In a statement, Google said: ""Late in the evening on 12 January, an issue with the exposure notifications system on Android began causing delays in the checking of potential exposures for those with apps installed. ""We have issued a fix. It may take a few hours for devices to catch up, and in some cases we will work directly with developers to help with recovery. The issue did not cause the loss of any data or potential exposures."" In November, a bug meant the the app stopped working for many iPhone users, although Apple said it did not think the problem was its fault, because apps in other countries were not affected. At the time the NHS told users to reset their iPhone location and privacy settings, and to make sure they had the most up-to-date version of its operating system. The England and Wales NHS Covid-19 contact tracing app had been downloaded more than 20 million times as of 2 December. Scotland and Northern Ireland run separate apps.","Google has fixed an issue that meant the NHS Covid-19 app stopped working on some Android phones, with users reporting being stuck on the loading page."
"Its competition commissioner is likely to outline her intentions against the search giant following a five-year EU investigation into the company. Reports suggest Margrethe Vestager will issue a ""statement of objections"". That would escalate a process that could ultimately lead to billions of euros of fines. But Google told employees on Tuesday that it had a ""very strong case"" and is expected to defend itself robustly in what could become one of the most contentious antitrust cases since the EU took on Microsoft 10 years ago. The Commission is responding to complaints that Google, which accounts for more than a 90% of EU-based web searches, favours its own products in search engine results. The company has yet to respond formally. 'Preferential treatment' The European Commission has investigated the antitrust allegations - made by Microsoft, Tripadvisor, Streetmap and others - since 2010. They object to the fact that the firm places reviews from Google+, directions from Google Maps, music and videos from YouTube, and adverts from its Adwords platform ahead of others' links in relevant searches. ""At the core must be the fundamental principle that Google must not abuse its power in general online search to give preferential treatment to its own separate services,"" Icomp, a lobbying group representing the complainants, said earlier this year.. ""If Google takes the view that users are best served by search results that integrate additional services, Google must choose the services that benefit consumers most, even if the services are not its own."" Last year, Google agreed to alter the way it displayed its search results, but the changes it suggested were deemed to be insufficient. The previous competition commissioner, Joaquin Almunia, asked the company to come up with a new plan. He left his post without resolving the matter, and was criticised by some politicians for not having taken a firmer stance. Legal requirement Ms Vestager, his successor, may take a tougher line by issuing a ""statement of objections"". This involves sending a letter that sets out all the objections the commission can base its final decision on, and is a legal requirement, providing Google an opportunity to respond before action is taken. Google could face huge fines and be ordered to reshape its business in Europe. In recent years, the Commission has imposed antitrust penalties on other tech giants, ordering Intel to pay 1.1bn euros (£793m; $1.2bn) in 2009 and Microsoft 516m euros in 2013. 'Example' Thomas Vinje, spokesman for FairSearch Europe, said issuing a statement of objections would ""represent a significant step towards ending Google's anti-competitive practices, which have harmed innovation and consumer choice"". ""Google's search engine makes it a gatekeeper to different markets in which Google itself also operates,"" said Paul Henty, a lawyer at Charles Russell Speechlys who has previously worked for the European Commission. ""I think the Commission will want to send an unequivocal message that it has a special responsibility to give its rivals fair and equal access to customers. ""But I can't see that this will be a fast process given the complexity of the subject matter, what's at stake and the likely level of the fine."" In an internal memo to its staff, Google insisted that competition to its search business was ""thriving"" despite allegations to the contrary. ""People can use Bing, Yahoo, Quora, DuckDuckGo, and a new wave of search assistants like Apple's Siri and Microsoft's Cortana,"" it said. ""In addition, users increasingly turn to social networks like Facebook and Twitter to find news and suggestions - where to eat or which movies to watch. ""[And] mobile is changing everything - with the explosion of apps taking people directly to the information they want."" International inquiries The EU's investigation is not the only one Google is facing. Investigators at India's Competition Commission delivered a report last week after carrying out a three-year probe into claims of unfair business practices. Their counterparts in Russia, Brazil, Argentina, Taiwan and Canada have also opened investigations. However, the US Federal Trade Commission dropped its own probe at the start of 2013 after Google made several non-binding commitments.",The European Union is expected to set out later the action it will take against Google over alleged anti-competitive behaviour.

She shared her experience with BBC Radio 5 live's Emma Barnett. ""They capped us on spending about one minute per post to decide whether it was spam and whether to remove the content,"" she said. ""Sometimes we would also remove the associated account. ""Management liked us not to work any more than eight hours per day, and we would review an average of about 8,000 posts per day, so roughly about 1,000 posts per hour. ""You pretty much learn on the job, specifically on day one. If I had to describe the job in one word, it would be 'strenuous'. Illegal images ""You definitely have to be prepared to see anything after just one click. You can be hit with things really fast without a warning. ""The piece of content that sticks with me was a piece of child pornography. ""Two children - the boy was maybe about 12 and the girl about eight or nine - standing facing each other. ""They weren't wearing pants and they were touching each other. It really seemed like an adult was probably off camera telling them what to do. It was very disturbing, mostly because you could tell that it was real. Reappearing posts ""A lot of these explicit posts circulate. We would often see them pop up from about six different users in one day, so that made it pretty challenging to find the original source. ""At the time there was nothing in the way of counselling services. There might be today, I'm not sure."" Sarah says she would probably have taken up counselling if it had been offered. ""They definitely warn you, but warning you and actually seeing it are different. ""Some folks think that they can handle it and it turns out they can't, or it's actually worse than they expected."" Graphic violence ""You become rather desensitised to it over time. I wouldn't say it gets any easier but you definitely do get used to it. ""There was obviously a lot of generic pornography between consenting adults, which wasn't as disturbing. ""There was some bestiality. There was one with a horse which kept on circulating. ""There's a lot of graphic violence, there was one when a woman had her head blown off. ""Half of her body was on the ground and the torso upwards was still on the chair. ""The policy was more stringent on removing pornography than it was for graphic violence."" Fake news ""I think Facebook was caught out by fake news. In the run-up to the US election, it seemed highly off the radar, at least at the time I was working there. ""I really cannot recall ever hearing the term 'fake news'. ""We saw a lot of news articles that were circulating and reported by users, but I don't ever recall management asking us to browse news articles to make sure that all the facts were accurate. ""It's very monotonous, and you really get used to what's spam and what's not. It just becomes a lot of clicking. ""Would I recommend it? If you could do anything else, I would say no."" Facebook responds The BBC shared Sarah's story with Facebook. In response, a Facebook spokesman said: ""Our reviewers play a crucial role in making Facebook a safe and open environment. ""This can be very challenging work, and we want to make sure they feel properly supported. ""That is why we offer regular training, counselling, and psychological support to all our employees and to everyone who works for us through our partners. ""Although we use artificial intelligence where we can, there are now over 7,000 people who review content on Facebook, and looking after their wellbeing is a real priority for us.""","""It's mostly pornography,"" says Sarah Katz, recalling her eight-month stint working as a Facebook moderator."
"By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter Chatbots or virtual assistants are creeping into all aspects of our lives - from boxes in the home, such as Amazon's Alexa, which can tell you your bank balance, to bots that pop up on messaging services or websites to help with your mortgage or order you a pizza. Add to that weather bots, news bots, shopping bots, personal finance bots and scheduling bots, and it becomes clear why chatbots are rapidly becoming the ""poster child of AI"". That's the view of Gerard Frith, chairman of AI consultancy company Matter, who has launched a number of bots in a range of organisations. He has seen a marked difference in attitude between different companies. While some are up front with customers about the fact that they are conversing with a machine, others aren't. ""When people know that they are talking to a chatbot, they are much less patient and want to escalate the call so that they can chat to a human,"" he told the BBC. ""Chatbots are clearly not as capable as a very good customer service person, but many people are not very good at customer service. ""So, then, chatbots do a valuable job. ""They understand when to pass a query on to a human, and they are actually often better than humans at answering complex questions."" IBM's cognitive platform Watson has always been good at interpreting natural language, so it makes sense that the technology is increasingly in-demand as a chatbot - most recently developing the Luvo platform for the Royal Bank of Scotland. Currently being tested among bank staff who handle queries from small business customers, Luvo will eventually be let loose on all customers. It can solve problems, without requiring human intervention, about 30% of the time. Luvo has been designed to be ""humanlike"" in its interactions and is learning sentiment analysis to work out whether a customer is unhappy. It has been trained to recognise different accents from around the UK. Paul Chong, director of IBM Watson Europe, thinks businesses will increasingly see voice, rather than apps or web pages, as the best way to interact with customers. ""In future people won't need to go to websites, it will all be about the conversation,"" he said. And chatbots were likely to change the way we converse. ""There are questions that people will ask a robot that they wouldn't ask a human,"" Mr Chong said. ""We are working with a couple of Australian universities, and people ask questions that they wouldn't ask a human such as, 'How do I make friends?'"" Pizza Hut is just about to launch its own chatbot, playing catch-up with rival Dominoes, which already has one. Described as ""conversational commerce"", the bot will launch in Twitter and Facebook Messenger later this year. Facebook Messenger now has 11,000 chatbots, while Kik - a popular messaging platform among teenagers, unveiled 6,000 new chatbots last month alone. Messaging apps are rapidly becoming the communication tool of choice for the young, and the top four - Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, WeChat and Viber - now have more registered users than the top four social networks. But not everyone is queuing up to employ a chatbot. Ikea was one of the first companies to use the technology - launching its virtual assistant, Anna, as a way to guide people around its website. But now it has abandoned Anna and has ""no plans"" to reintroduce her. In a statement to the BBC, an Ikea representative said: ""For over 10 years, our automated online assistant, Anna, has cheerfully answered people's questions on Ikea.com. ""But as times changed and technology developed, last year it was decided that it was time for Anna to move on. ""So last year ""Ask Anna!"" was removed from Ikea.com."" Magnus Jern, president of mobile solutions company DMI, who was involved in the launch of the mobile version of Anna, has some advice for those thinking about using a chatbot. ""In the beginning, we tried to impersonate a person, and we found that there was no reason to do that,"" he said. In fact, trying to make Anna ""human-like' meant that people were more likely to ask it stupid questions, Mr Jern said. ""Around 50% of questions were sex-related,"" he said. ""If you try too hard to be natural, it diverts from the real purpose of it, which is about giving the right answer as fast as possible."" Customer frustration may have played a part in the demise of Anna, and it is something that others will have to be aware of. Writing recently in Tech Crunch, Arun Uday, a venture capitalist and founder of mobile group chat app Tring Chat, said: ""When a customer has an issue, they would most likely want to skip automated response options and speak to a real person who can fix their problem - not chat with a semi-intelligent bot dishing out some canned responses."" But Mr Jern remains more optimistic, believing not only that chatbots are here to stay but that they are likely to become far more sophisticated. ""It will get more and more difficult to distinguish between the real people and the fake ones,"" he said.","We might regard our semi-intelligent smartphone assistants with a mixture of affection and frustration, but our attempts at getting answers from them are going to be just the start of a much bigger conversation."
"The site, called Playpen, was located on the Tor network used to anonymise web-browsing activity. Fluckiger was ""heavily involved"" in the running of the members-only site, said the US Department of Justice (DoJ). The investigation into the site has led to the rescue of 49 American children who had been subject to abuse. Hidden viewers Fluckiger of Portland, Indiana, was ""co-administrator"" of the site, said the DoJ, and helped Playpen members see and read ""tens of thousands"" of messages relating to the sexual abuse of children. He managed membership lists, enforced site rules and deleted any content that was not related to indecent images of children. Two other men who helped run the site, David Lynn Browning of Kentucky and Steven W. Chase of Florida, have pleaded guilty and are due to be sentenced soon. Across the US, 48 active child abusers have been prosecuted as a result of the investigation, said the DoJ. It added that, in total, 200 prosecutions had resulted from the long-running investigation. Playpen was located on a server on the well-known Tor network which hides the identity and location of browsers by encrypting data and bouncing it between different computers. Law enforcement agencies caught the site administrators, and many members of Playpen, by using techniques that stripped them of the anonymity Tor can provide. Legal challenges against this investigative technique have been filed by some alleged Playpen members. Once the site's administrators had been arrested, the FBI kept the site going for 13 days to gather information about members.",American Michael Fluckiger has been sentenced to 20 years in jail for running a site that trafficked images of child sex abuse.
"This week the American agency which oversees net addresses in the region gave out the last block of these vital net components. It said companies in North America should now accelerate their move to the latest version of the net's addressing system. Now Africa is the only region with any significant blocks of the older version 4 internet addresses available. Rising prices The older addressing system, called IPv4, was created when the net was being set up in the 1970s. The system can support up to 4.3 billion addresses but the massive growth of the online world has swiftly depleted this. The successor addressing system, known as IPv6, can handle a vast number of addresses and is unlikely to ever run out. IPv6 has been available since 1999 but only now are large numbers of firms starting to use it. ""Organisations should be prepared to help usher in the next phase of the internet by deploying IPv6 as soon as possible,"" John Curran, head of the American Registry for Internet Numbers (Arin) told tech news site The Register. Shifting to IPv6 can be tricky for some ISPs because, for the time being, they have to support both old and new addressing schemes. Running both and translating from one to the other can break some services and introduce delays that irk customers. Afrinic, which hands out net addresses in Africa, currently has about 2.3 million IPv4 addresses left and these look set to run out by early 2019, statistics suggest. Stocks of IPv4 addresses ran out in other regions several years ago. Axel Pawlik, managing director of Europe's net address administrator Ripe NCC, said Arin exhausting its stock of IPv4 addresses was a ""landmark moment in the history of the internet"". ""This means that organisations across North America can now only obtain IPv4 addresses by trading for them,"" he said. ""For networks looking to grow, this will increasingly create pressure in the immediate future. "" The steady depletion of IPv4 addresses has kicked off a market in buying and selling chunks of addresses that large or defunct companies no longer use. The Arin depletion might spark a significant rise in prices, suggests research by the IPv4 Market Group which acts as a broker for firms with addresses to sell. The sale of several big blocks of addresses from very large companies including Merck, Lilly, Dupont and Nortel could spell problems for anyone looking to buy a significant number of addresses, it said. The lack of single big blocks would probably drive prices upwards as anyone requiring lots of addresses would have to get them from several sources, it said. In May, the UK's Department for Work and Pensions started selling off some IPv4 addresses it owned and got about £7 for each of the 150,000 it sold. Arin's announcement came as BT, the UK's biggest ISP, unveiled that it planned to enable its entire network for IPv6 by the end of 2016.",North America has officially run out of its stock of old net addresses.
"The company said that about 700 of its ""partners"" in the US had been affected by the mistake. Exposed data included social security numbers, photos of driver licences, tax forms and other details, according to news site Motherboard, which first reported the issue. The error was discovered by the drivers themselves. ""Whoah - went to upload new insurance docs and the documents page showed me thousands of people private info (social security numbers, home addresses, tax info). I screencapped it and sent to support,"" wrote one driver on the discussion site Reddit. It is not clear if anyone unconnected to the company was able to access the information before the problem was addressed. ""We were notified about a bug impacting a fraction of our US drivers earlier this afternoon,"" Uber said in a statement. ""Within 30 minutes, our security team had fixed the issue. ""We'd like to thank the driver who drew it to our attention and apologise to those drivers whose information may have been affected. ""Their security is incredibly important to Uber, and we will follow up with them directly."" This is not the first time the US company has had to tackle a security issue involving its drivers. It previously acknowledged that in 2014 a hacker had been able to access a database containing current and former Uber drivers.",Uber has acknowledged that a flaw in its software caused it to leak personal data belonging to its drivers.
"It had previously said letting people download shows added too much ""complexity"" to its experience. Other video apps such as BBC iPlayer, All 4 and Amazon Prime Video already let viewers watch content when offline. Netflix said some of its original programmes were already available to download and more would be made available in the future. ""It's surprising because just weeks ago they said it wasn't going to happen,"" said Tom Harrington from the consultancy Enders Analysis. ""You can understand why they wouldn't want to do it because it opens up a whole pot of rights issues. Offering a download service will cost Netflix more. ""But everyone else is already doing it. Amazon is doing it, Sky has been doing something similar with Sky Q. Netflix doesn't want to be left behind, or compared unfavourably to rivals.""","Netflix is allowing some of its shows and films to be downloaded and watched offline, the company has announced."
"The short-form video app has become a fertile birthing ground for memes, many of them music-related. One example involved users and their pets switching into cowboy and cowgirl clothing at a certain point in rapper Lil Nas X's song Old Town Road - something that is credited with it becoming a huge hit. But some politicians are worried the app's Chinese owner, Bytedance, poses a risk to national security. Regulators have also raised their own safety concerns. So is the app safe or is the fervour about TikTok a tempest in a teapot? How does it work? People - mostly under-20s - use the app to post 15-second videos. Many involve lip-synching to songs, comedy routines and/or unusual editing tricks. These are then made available to both followers and strangers. By default, all accounts are public, although users can restrict uploads to an approved list of contacts. An algorithm analyses what type of material each user pays most attention to, to hook them on other clips, and it's easy to lose track of time as one auto-plays after another. Members can also search for specific topics or users and browse by clicking on hashtags. TikTok also allows private messages to be sent but this facility is limited to ""friends"". Anyone over the age of 13 can use it and there are parental controls. Many of its long-term members originally downloaded Musical.ly, a rival short-form video app owned by a separate Chinese start-up. But it was acquired by Bytedance, in 2017, which merged the two platforms. Beijing-based Bytedance, also has a sister app, Douyin. This is run on a different network in order to comply with Chinese censorship rules. The company is no stranger to controversy. This past year, it garnered a temporary ban in India, a US counter-intelligence investigation and a record £4.3m fine after Musical.ly was found to have knowingly hosted content published by under-age users. Why are people worried about TikTok's handling of data? Critics in the US warn the app has the potential to compromise users' privacy. Alex Stamos, who is the former chief security officer of Facebook and now a Stanford professor, tweeted his concern after reports emerged of a clash between Bytedance's US and Chinese employees. Former members of the US content-vetting team - which removes clips featuring terrorism and pornography - had said their China-based colleagues had also told them to take down videos that would not normally be flagged for abusive content in the US, according to a report in the Washington Post. The deleted videos reportedly contained heavy kissing, suggestive dance moves and political debate. Others worry about the fact China requires its social-media apps to provide the state access to users' information. But Bytedance says data about users in other countries is stored separately and not shared with the Chinese authorities. Why else are US lawmakers concerned? Earlier this week, US politicians asked TikTok to testify at a congressional hearing. They wanted the company to clear up allegations it was beholden to the Chinese state. Several US senators have joined the call for a government investigation. Arkansas senator Tom Cotton has claimed TikTok might be the target of a foreign-influence campaign, like those carried out on Facebook and Twitter in the 2016 election. Bytedance says TikTok does not carry political ads - but the senator said there were still concerns China might find other ways to use ""personal sensitive information"" about the app's users. And he worries the company could be compelled to co-operate with intelligence work driven by the Chinese Communist Party. What is TikTok doing to allay concerns? The company says it has changed over the course of 2019. It used to apply ""one-size-fits-all"" content guidelines to all its international markets - but now US moderation decisions are handled locally. Vanessa Pappas, US general manager for TikTok told BBC News: ""Consistent with our rapid growth, we are working to further strengthen the capabilities and increase the autonomy of the US team."" In addition, the company has hired a third party to carry out an audit meant to ensure users' data is not transmitted to China via third-party apps that can plug into TikTok. What does this mean for TikTok? Grindr, the gay dating app acquired by the Chinese company Kulun, represents a cautionary tale for TikTok. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (Cifius) has compelled Kulun to sell Grindr, which it has agreed to do in 2020. Cifius has the power to unwind foreign takeovers of US companies if it finds there to be a national security threat. And it ruled Grindr held too much personal information about US soldiers. The same committee is now reported to be looking into the takeover of Musical.ly on the basis the company had a California base, even though it was headquartered in Shanghai. If Bytedance is unable to convince lawmakers - who are in the midst of an election cycle - it does not pose a potential threat, TikTok could suffer a similar fate. Three things could happen: TikTok also faces regulatory scrutiny in the UK. Information commissioner Elizabeth Denham confirmed in July she was investigating how it used children's data. ""We do have an active investigation into TikTok right now, so you can watch that space,"" the regulator told MPs.","TikTok is thought to have about half a billion active users worldwide, with a large percentage in their teens or early 20s."
"By Daniel ThomasTechnology reporter US firm Voyage said it will start rolling out the service at The Villages, Florida which is home to 125,000 senior residents. It said the scheme, spanning 750 miles of road, would be the ""largest by area size"" in the world. It comes as safety concerns about self-driving cars persist after testing problems and some accidents. Voyage already operates a handful of driverless taxis at another retirement community in San Jose, California, also called the Villages, but said it had begun testing vehicles in Florida ahead of a much larger roll-out. Once the scheme is fully operational, it said all residents would be able to summon a self-driving car using its mobile app. ""[Then they can] travel anywhere within the bounds of the community fully autonomously,"" it said. The sprawling Villages encompasses three distinct downtown areas, more than 100 dining options, eight major supermarkets and 7.8 million sq ft of commercial real estate. It has also attracted controversy following reports about a raucous nightlife and public displays of debauchery. Most experts agree robot cars will first be deployed as fleets of self-driving taxis in controlled environments such as university campuses, business parks or retirement communities. But some research suggests the elderly are unlikely to trust robot cars. According to a 2016 survey by Kelley Blue Book, a car valuation and research firm, only 9% of those aged 51-64 said they felt confident enough to travel in a fully driverless vehicle, compared with 38% of those aged 12-15. Voyage's self-driving cars aren't fully autonomous: all have safety drivers behind the wheel, who can intervene in an emergency. The firm said it predicts ""high demand"" from residents and has reportedly given an equity stake in its company to the owners of The Villages. Florida is one of more than 20 US states to have approved the use of autonomous vehicles on its roads. But while experts say self-driving technology could make driving safer, fears about the technology persist. Some vehicle tests have gone awry and computer error was deemed partly to blame in a crash involving a Tesla vehicle last year. On Wednesday, a self-driving car operated by Argo AI, a firm backed by Ford, was involved in a crash in Pittsburgh that led to two people being hospitalised. Early reports suggest the accident was the result of human error. Ford declined to comment on whether the vehicle was in self-driving mode at the time, or whether Argo has stopped testing the cars while it investigates the crash. In an email to tech news site the Verge, it said: ""We're aware that an Argo AI test vehicle was involved in an accident. We're gathering all the information. Our initial focus is on making sure that everyone involved is safe.""",One of America's largest retirement villages will have a fleet of self-driving taxis introduced next year.
"By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter You might also question how relevant it is to you and what you do online. Advocates of the principle argue that the debate about how networks operate is fundamentally one about the future of the internet. Ahead of a crucial US vote on the subject, the BBC has compiled a guide to all you need to know about net neutrality. What is net neutrality? Anyone who has ever looked with envy at the first-class carriages on a crowded commuter train - and wondered bitterly why a few get to travel in comfort while the rest are crammed against each other's armpits - will have a good basic understanding of net neutrality. On the net neutrality train, all passengers (ie data) would be treated equally, with no special carriages for those able to pay. This long-held principle that all traffic on the network should be treated the same goes back to the very dawning of the web and for many enshrines the whole ethos of an open internet, free from corporate control. Those in favour of net neutrality argue that the internet service providers (ISPs) that provide the pipes for content should just run the networks and have no say over how and what content flows to consumers, as long as it is legal. But ISPs argue that a tiered internet - where those content providers prepared to pay can go in an internet ""fast lane"" - is inevitable in today's data-hungry net world. Why is net neutrality in the headlines? Much of the current debate was kickstarted by a landmark case in the US in January, which saw ISP Verizon successfully challenging the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) over its net neutrality policy - known formally as the Open Internet rules. The Court of Appeals struck down two of the three open internet rules, effectively leaving regulation in limbo and opening the way for ISPs to start charging fees to carry bandwidth-hungry data on its networks. And charge they did. In March Netflix reluctantly agreed to pay a fee to Comcast to improve the speed at which its service reached consumers' homes. The changing landscape forced the FCC to rethink its rules, and leaks of what it proposed emerged in April. The part of the rule change that has sent the industry into uproar is a proposal for so-called fast lanes, allowing ISPs to charge content providers as long as the terms were ""commercially reasonable"". The details of what the FCC proposes will be revealed on 15 May. It is worth noting that, at this stage, these are just proposals and that the full rules are not likely to be implemented before the end of the year. What has been the reaction to the proposed changes? It would be fair to say that the FCC has found itself at the centre of a considerable storm since details about the proposed changes leaked. Chairman Tom Wheeler's morning mail pile has grown considerably, with his recent correspondence including a letter signed by more than 100 tech firms with some of biggest names in the industry - Google, Amazon, Twitter, Facebook - offering their support. The letter calls on the FCC to protect users ""against blocking, discrimination and paid prioritisation"". This was followed by a very similarly worded letter from some of the most high-profile US venture capitalists and another from more than 80 advocacy groups. Meanwhile, the FCC's main consumer hotline seems to have been overwhelmed by messages about the forthcoming changes - and now asks callers to write an email to the commission if they are calling about net neutrality. And to really hammer the message home, a growing number of protesters are gathering outside the FCC headquarters in Washington ahead of the scheduled vote on the proposals by the five commissioners. Already two of them have got cold feet and suggested that the vote be delayed. What are the arguments for changing the rules? ISPs argue that the internet today is a very different beast from that of the early days when the net neutrality principle was enshrined. Who then could have predicted that we would all be watching video content on our computers and mobile devices? Carrying such data obviously costs more and ISPs argue that the costs of carrying such bandwidth-hungry services can no longer be borne by them alone. They say that concerns that they plan to block content or degrade network performance are unfounded and that data discrimination in order to guarantee quality of service is actually something consumers should want. What else could the FCC do? Consumer advocates are urging the regulatory body to take more drastic action and reclassify internet service providers as a telecommunication service. By doing so, the internet would be treated more like a public utility, such as gas and water, and therefore subject to heavier regulation. It would mean, say the advocates of net neutrality, that the FCC had more teeth when it came to enforcing net neutrality. What's the view about net neutrality outside the US? Europe is at odds with the US. In April, the European Parliament voted to restrict ISPs from charging services for faster network access. It also ruled that mobile and broadband network providers should not be able to block services that competed with their own offerings. There are some more legal hurdles for the vote to pass but it could become law by the end of the year. Slovenia and the Netherlands have already enshrined the principle in their national law. And in Brazil, a new law has been signed by President Dilma Rousseff which establishes that telecom companies cannot change prices based on the amount of content accessed by users. It also states that ISPs cannot interfere with how consumers use the internet. Meanwhile, neighbouring Chile was the first country to pass net neutrality legislation, back in 2010. Why should you care? Depending on which way the decision goes, it could either hurt your wallet or your watching habits. If net neutrality is upheld, ISPs could decide to pass on the cost of delivering bandwidth-hungry up the cost of services to pay for delivering faster bandwidth - and raise the monthly fee they charge for net access. Users may get a bill that reflects their usage, with those using video-on-demand services being charged more. If, on the other hand, ISPs get their way and are able to start charging fees for prioritised access to content then users may find that those websites not in the fast lane are slow to load. Some fear that ISPs might even block access to rival services or slow them down so much as to be unusable. Consumers could also be charged more by the content providers forced to pay more to get their services to them in quality. Anyone thinking this is a US-only issue should note that, following its agreement to pay a fee to Comcast and Verizon, Netflix put up the price for its monthly streaming service in Europe as well as America.","Net neutrality is a term you may have heard but, if asked to explain it in a pub, you might struggle."
"The youth charity, which was founded by Prince Charles, said it was ""not accepting new donations from Huawei in light of public concerns"". The company had supported the trust for more than a decade. University of Oxford and Queen's University Belfast have also decided not to ask them for new donations. But the University of Cambridge - which benefits from a £25m initiative involving Huawei - said its partnership was not affected. ""We review all of our relationships regularly. This case is no different,"" said a spokesman for the university. Likewise, the University of Surrey - which houses one of the country's leading 5G research centres - said it would maintain its links to the firm. ""We will continue to work with all our research partners, including Huawei, unless there are clear and compelling reasons not to,"" said a spokesman. Huawei also has ties to the Universities of York, Southampton, Reading and Edinburgh Napier among others. Feared threat Huawei faces claims that it poses a potential threat to countries that use its technologies, because Beijing might coerce it into providing a way to spy on its clients' communications networks or crash them during an international dispute. The company's founder Ren Zhengfei recently told foreign media that he would ""never harm the interest of my customers"" and that his company would ""not answer to such requests"". But the US government - which has been one of Huawei's leading critics - does not accept such assurances. ""Huawei has a profit incentive to act in good faith,"" a Department of Homeland Security official told the Wall Street Journal. ""But the party will get what they want."" 'Disappointed' Huawei has supported the Prince's Trust since 2007 and was made one of its patrons in 2016, in recognition of the level of support it had provided. The company has donated a total of £490,000 to the organisation. Much of this was raised via an annual winter concert held at London's Royal Festival Hall. At parties hosted by Huawei at the event, a disadvantaged young person helped by the trust would regularly give an account of how they had been supported to start a business or otherwise improve their situation. The fixtures attracted several leading members of society, but were not attended by Prince Charles himself. ""We were disappointed to hear this news from the trust, as we have the greatest respect for the excellent work it does with young people,"" said a spokesman for Huawei. ""We are proud of our 10-year partnership and of course hope we can work together again in the future. ""We regret that decisions of this sort are being taken as a result of ill-informed and unfounded discourse about Huawei."" A spokeswoman for the trust said that: ""Future donations will continue to be reviewed by our Ethical Fundraising Committee."" She added that the firm would retain its status as a patron ""until all current commitments have been delivered"". Overtaking Samsung Restrictions on Huawei's ability to sell its 5G gear to overseas mobile networks threaten its profits, after it has spent huge sums on developing the technologies. In the UK, for example, BT has already said it will not use the firm's equipment in the ""core"" of its network, although it still plans to use its phone mast antennas and other products elsewhere. But even this could be constrained if the government decides to act on ""deep concerns"", voiced by the Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson, on the use of its kit. The company has reportedly written to staff saying jobs may need to be cut if it has to lower its targets. Huawei, however, remains confident about the performance of its handset business, which continues to grow despite it failing to secure a distribution deal with a US network. The unit shipped 208 million handsets in 2018, putting it behind only Samsung. ""Even without the US market we will be number one in the world,"" the firm's consumer division chief, Richard Yu, has told reporters in Beijing. ""I believe at the earliest this year and next year at the latest."" He added that Huawei would unveil a foldable-screened handset at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona next month. In other related developments:","The Prince's Trust has become the latest organisation to back away from Huawei, following security fears raised about the Chinese tech firm."
"By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter The US-owned retail firm, which processes hundreds of thousands of online orders each week, could have put millions of transactions at risk, security expert Paul Moore estimates. He first noticed the issue in March 2014 and contacted Asda to report it. Asda said it had now fixed the problem and no customers had been affected. The firm, whose website is run by US retail giant Walmart, told the BBC: ""Asda and Walmart take the security of our websites very seriously. We are aware of the issue and have implemented changes to improve the security on our website."" ""The points flagged pose a low risk to customers and our monitoring of these security issues indicate that no customer information has been compromised over that two-year period."" Since Mr Moore went public with the information it has acted to improve its security. ""The small risk to customer information has been removed and an update has been applied, we're now adding further enhancements which will be completed by this evening. In short, one of the two issues is fixed but nothing that remains poses any risk to any customer information or card details,"" it told the BBC. The issue occurred because of two well-known exploits, cross-site scripting (XSS) and cross-site request forgery (CSRF), which combined, can offer hackers access to all the information users put on the site, said Mr Moore. It means that - if someone had both the Asda website open and another site that is infected with malware - they could be vulnerable to attack. ""CSRF exploits the trust a site has in the user's browser, allowing an attacker to issue requests on your behalf and from your own PC. XSS allows an attacker to embed malicious content into the page to alter anything and everything the user can see,"" he explained. Asda is by no means alone in having a website open to these security flaws but Mr Moore believes that it should have acted more quickly to rectify the problem. ""Back in March 2014, I contacted Asda to report several security vulnerabilities and despite a fix promised 'in the next few weeks', little appears to have changed,"" he said. ""Asda also failed to issue adequate security headers which help mitigate the risk by instructing the browser to discard content which ASDA deem malicious or unnecessary. The majority of modern browsers support content security policy (CSP) which effectively blocks this type of attack, but very few sites adopt this technique,"" he added. When he published his blog, he advised users ""to shop elsewhere"". ""Asda/Walmart have had ample opportunity to fix these issues and have failed to do so. If you must continue shopping with Asda, open a private window and do not open any other tabs or windows until you've logged out,"" he added. Open tabs Prof Alan Woodward, a security expert from the University of Surrey, said that Asda's assertion that its site is secure is correct but that does not mean that users are not at risk. ""Cross-site scripting can easily be exploited by hackers if someone has a website open that has this malware embedded at the same time as they are shopping online and the shopping site has not protected the data entry fields appropriately,"" he said. ""Most people do have dozens of tabs open at any given time."" He did not go as far as suggesting people stop shopping there but added: ""I think I'd play safe and make sure you have only one tab open just in case one of your other sites is infected."" ""This is an example of of how companies need to look beyond the boundaries of their own website. This is a common exploit but it can be very easily fixed. It is half a line of code that can fix it,"" he added. There are scanners available online that can immediately tell whether websites have the correct security headers. One such site that scans the web for such headers found that, out of the million most popular websites, only 1,365 sites had them in place.","A flaw on supermarket Asda's website gave hackers the chance to collect customers' personal information and payment details, the BBC has learned."
"""By the way, Disney's live action Beauty and the Beast opens today,"" the smart speaker said after listing the time, weather and travel update. In a video posted on Twitter, it then talked about the plot and suggested asking it about main character Belle for ""more movie fun"". Google denied that the material on Home was an advertisement. It appeared as part of a ""My Day"" feature where the digital assistant provides an update which can include calendar events and news bulletins. ""This wasn't intended to be an ad,"" said a spokeswoman. ""What's circulating online was a part of our My Day feature, where after providing helpful information about your day, we sometimes call out timely content. ""We're continuing to experiment with new ways to surface unique content for users and we could have done better in this case."" The device is not yet available outside the US. The tech giant has experimented before with including what it calls ""seasonal timely content"" on the Google Home device without it being requested. Previous material on the themes of Black History Month and the Oscars has also run. 'Tricky conundrum' The rise of digital assistants presents a ""tricky conundrum"" for advertising sales, said analyst Ben Wood from CCS Insight. ""Unlike adverts inserted on a screen which can be glossed over, anything presented in an audio format risks being incredibly intrusive,"" he said. ""The most likely outcome will be that there would be ad-funded voice assistants where the user gets a discounted device in return for accepting adverts."" He added that Google faces a different challenge to Amazon, which markets rival home assistant the Amazon Echo. ""Google's primary business model is predicated on advertising,"" he said. ""Whereas for Amazon its about transactional revenue where a voice assistant like Echo can help drive sales.""",Google has removed audio about the movie Beauty and the Beast which played out unprompted on Google Home.
"Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent@BBCRoryCJon Twitter It looks as though the new chief executive Satya Nadella has looked at the strategy of his predecessor Steve Ballmer and decided it was a disaster. It was Ballmer who decided to buy Nokia, and when the deal was announced he told me ""together as one company with the devices folks at Nokia, we'll do a phenomenal job"". With hindsight, it looks like a phenomenal error - but was it obvious at the time? Investors were certainly dubious, but even today Microsoft isn't prepared to accept that it was a bad idea. The line from the company is that it was the right decision at the time but that the mobile phone market changes at an incredible pace. A blogger who writes about Windows argues passionately in support of that view. He argues that having formed the initial partnership with Nokia, making it the flagship Windows Phone builder, Microsoft had little alternative but to go ahead with a full takeover. ""Nokia was already in dire straits, and their board was getting itchy for alternatives,"" writes Daniel Rubino.""Had Nokia decided to jump all-in on Android devices - or worse - sold to a competitor, neither would have been good for Microsoft and their Windows Phone story."" That may be true, but it begs the question of whether Nokia was ever the right partner. For a company that is now going to focus on business customers - always its core strength - it might have been more sensible to tie up with Blackberry. The ailing Canadian firm still has a strong reputation for security, and many professional and enterprise customers remain wistfully nostalgic about its devices. Windows Blackberry could have been a very lucrative niche. What next then? Microsoft insists that it will still make smartphones, but will focus on its wider ""ecosystem"". There will be fewer in-house phones, and the aim will be for them to showcase Windows Phone's capabilities for other manufacturers, much as the Surface does for tablets. But it is hard to see the likes of Samsung and HTC rushing to make Windows Phone handsets, however great their concerns about their reliance on Android. And whatever Microsoft says about developing its own mobile ecosystem, it looks as though selling access to its software on other mobile platforms may prove more lucrative. The real tragedy here is for Nokia, Finland and Europe. In 2013, Steve Ballmer promised that Finland would become the ""hub and the centre for our phone R&D"". That at least seemed to promise that the team at what was - only a few years previously - Europe's technology superpower would stay intact, albeit under US ownership. Who knows what would have happened if Nokia had tried to carry on as an independent business - but it could hardly have turned out worse. This week's edition of Tech Tent looks at what went wrong with Microsoft's mobile strategy - on BBC World Service at 16:05 GMT/17:05 BST","Microsoft's takeover of Nokia's mobile phone operation is bound to end up as a business school case study. The deal now looks like a disaster for all concerned - many of the 25,000 Nokia employees have seen their jobs disappear and Microsoft has written off just about all the money it spent."
"The feature is the result of a collaboration between the Chinese tech firm and German camera-maker Leica. It means the P9 can create shallow depth-of-field shots more commonly associated with larger lenses. Analysts say the innovation could help Huawei promote itself as a premium brand and expand its market share. The Shenzhen-based company shipped more than 106 million handsets in 2015, representing 44.3% growth on the previous year, according to the research firm IDC. That was the fastest rise in sales of any of the major brands and put Huawei in third place in terms of market share. However, Apple still sold more than double the number of phones and Samsung more than three times the figure. ""The camera is one of the things that defines a premium smartphone, and there's still plenty of room to improve the quality of the photography,"" commented Ian Fogg from the IHS Technology consultancy. ""And there are things you can do when you put two camera sensors on the back that you can't do with a single sensor."" Shallow focus effect Rather than offering users the ability to take two different types of photos- as is the case with LG's dual-camera G5 handset - the P9 combines the data from both its rear sensors to create its 12 megapixel shots. One captures red, green and blue (RGB) information about the view, while the other is limited to collecting monochrome image data. By making use of both types, the firm says, the phone can deliver better contrast and offer superior performance in low-light conditions. But the standout feature is the ability to simulate wide-aperture photography - the effect of allowing more light into a lens in order to create a shallow depth-of-field. A shallow depth-of-field can create striking photographs of a subject with a blurry background. Photography enthusiasts often spend considerable sums on digital single-lens reflex cameras (DSLRs) and large lenses to create the look. Unlike these larger cameras, the P9 also allows users to alter the part of the image they want to be in sharp focus after they have pressed the shutter button. This is made possible by the fact that the phone's two lenses capture slightly different views, and built-in software can analyse the differences to deduce depth information. Alternatively, the files can be exported in the RAW file format for editing on a PC. The facility is only available in stills mode, however, and cannot be used to refocus captured videos. Lytro previously tried to sell specialist cameras that offered a similar refocusing ability, however it recently gave up on the consumer market after acknowledging that the rise of smartphone photography had restricted its appeal. Nokia and HTC have also offered refocusing functions on some of their handsets, although they achieved the effect in a different manner. Strong brand One industry-watcher said that the tie-up with Leica should encourage potential buyers not to dismiss Huawei's dual-camera facility as being a gimmick. ""Leica is one of the strongest brands in photography, so having an association with them should make users believe that the quality of the pictures should be good,"" said Francisco Jeronimo, research director for European mobile devices at IDC. ""Of course, the quality of the image won't be the same as is possible from one of Leica's own cameras, but it does tell people that a company that really understands photography has been involved in engineering the device."" However, Mr Fogg added that Huawei would need to get its marketing right to make the most of the partnership. ""Leica isn't massively well known outside of serious camera enthusiasts,"" he explained. ""So, Huawei's challenge is how to communicate the benefit of the Leica brand to the general public as it is pushing the P9 as a mass-market flagship and not a niche device aimed at just the camera-centric few."" Higher prices Other features of the P9 include: It will cost between 599 euros ($682; £485) and 649 euros when it goes on sale on 16 April, depending on how much RAM and built-in storage is desired. The firm is also offering a larger P9 Plus model, which has a 5.5in screen and a bigger battery. It will cost 749 euros. These mark a jump in cost over last year's P8 family, which ranged from 499 to 649 euros.",Huawei has unveiled an Android smartphone that uses dual-camera technology to let owners refocus photos after they have been taken.
"By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter The ad triggered the devices to read out information about the burgers from online encyclopaedia Wikipedia. However, somebody edited Wikipedia to describe the Whopper as the ""worst hamburger product"" and another added cyanide to the list of ingredients. The BBC understands the ad was blocked. Google did not publicly confirm this, saying only that it had ""no involvement"" in the campaign. But Burger King confirmed to the BBC that after the first iteration of the ad was blocked, it ran a tweaked version on US TV. According to a Burger King spokeswoman, the new ad was revoiced using a ""different intonation"" that bypassed the ban. In the 15-second advert, a Burger King employee asks ""OK, Google. What is the Whopper burger?"" The stunt has put Wikipedia in the spotlight after reports that Burger King's own marketing team edited the Whopper page shortly before the ad campaign. The history of the page shows that changes were made on 4 April by Burger King Corporation. It edited the description of the product to include the lines ""America's favourite burger"" and ""100% beef with no preservatives"". This change was quickly re-edited back to the original version. Wikipedia has not responded to requests for comment. Invading homes Whether Burger King expected users to go on to make their own, less flattering edits is unclear but Emily Tan, technology editor at marketing news website Campaign, thinks it might have been aware such a reaction was likely. ""Burger King has a reputation as quite a provocative brand and the idea that users are hijacking a brand can charm and amuse people. There is a chance that Burger King expected this to happen,"" she said. However, she thought it was less likely they expected the backlash from users about the intrusive nature of such adverts. ""People didn't like this invading their living rooms. Studies suggest that people feel quite close to these smart speaker devices, they become a personality, and when something you regard as your friend pipes up with information that you didn't ask for, that creeps people out."" The stunt has also renewed concerns about voice-activated home speakers being used for advertising. While Burger King said that it ""saw an opportunity to do something exciting with the emerging technology of intelligent personal assistant devices"", others feel it should have acted with more caution. ""Brands are always keen to jump on the newest technologies to engage their audience and sometimes this means mistakes are made.,"" Justin Pearse, managing director of Drum Studios, an arm of marketing news website, The Drum told the BBC. ""While it's crucial brands have the bravery to experiment with new ad models, such as voice-activated advertising, it's also vital to do this with caution."" Google and Amazon are currently engaged in a battle over who will dominate the new voice-activated AI-enabled smart assistant market. Both rely on their products to help sell more products, with Amazon's Alexa recommending discounts and offers to users. Previously Google came under fire when Google Home began playing out information about new film Beauty and the Beast. Google denied the material was an advertisement but removed it anyway. ""Voice-activation is the new frontier for advertising and will provide incredible benefits for brands and consumers alike,"" said Mr Pearse. ""But like any new frontier, it pays to tread with caution. Brands need to consider how consumers will react rather than just what the technology can do.""",A Burger King TV advert which was designed to activate Google Home smart speakers and some Android phones to describe its Whopper burgers has been hijacked by members of the public.
"The team froze phones for an hour as a way to get around the encryption system that protects the data on a phone by scrambling it. Google introduced the data scrambling system with the version of Android known as Ice Cream Sandwich. The attack allowed the researchers to get at contact lists, browsing histories and photos. Cold start Android's data scrambling system was good for end users but a ""nightmare"" for law enforcement and forensics workers, the team at Erlangen's Friedrich-Alexander University (FAU) wrote in a blogpost about their work. To get around this, researchers Tilo Muller, Michael Spreitzenbarth and Felix Freiling from FAU put Android phones in a freezer for an hour until the device had cooled to below -10C. The trio discovered that quickly connecting and disconnecting the battery of a frozen phone forced the handset into a vulnerable mode. This loophole let them start it up with some custom-built software rather than its onboard Android operating system. The researchers dubbed their custom code Frost - Forensic Recovery of Scrambled Telephones. The Frost software helped them copy data on a phone that could then be analysed on a separate computer. A chilled phone also helped their hacking project. Data fades from memory much more slowly when chips are cold which allowed them to grab the encryption keys and speed up unscrambling the contents of a phone. PhD student Tilo Muller told the BBC that the attack generally gave them access to data that had been put in memory as users browsed websites, sent messages or shared pictures. The researchers tested their attack against a Samsung Galaxy Nexus handset as it was one of the first to use Android's disk encryption system. However, they said, other phones were just as likely to be vulnerable to the attack. The team are planning further tests on other Android handsets. While the ""cold boot"" attack had been tried on desktop PCs and laptops, Mr Muller said the trio were the first to try it on phones. ""We thought it would work because smartphones are really small PCs,"" he said. ""but we were quite excited that the trick with the freezer worked so well."" The German research group is now working on defences against the attack that ensures encryption keys are never put in vulnerable memory chips. Instead they are only used in the memory directly attached to a phone's processor.","Freezing an Android phone can help reveal its confidential contents, German security researchers have found."
"Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent@BBCRoryCJon Twitter But on the Tech Tent podcast this week, we find out how TikTok got immersed in a deadly serious row about censorship. It was Sunday evening when 17-year-old Feroza Aziz posted a video on her TikTok account. It appeared at first to be a guide to curling your eyelashes. But after a few seconds, she put down the eyelash curler and urged viewers to search out information about China's mistreatment of Uighur Muslims. Speaking to the BBC, she explained why she felt compelled to act. ""As a Muslim, I've always faced oppression and racism. But to see that these group of people, this ethnic group is going through much more than I could ever imagine, I thought that this isn't right and I need to spread awareness about this,"" she said. Her denunciation of what she described as ""another holocaust"" seemed designed to provoke TikTok's Chinese owner Bytedance, testing its claims that outside China it does not censor political content. Indeed, in a follow-up video she explained that she started her video chatting about eyelashes as a way of slipping past the moderators. Account suspended As the video went viral, both on TikTok and other platforms, the social media world waited for Bytedance to act. But at first nothing happened and the video stayed up. Then, says Feroza, she woke up on Monday morning to find her account was suspended, meaning she could not post any new videos. By Tuesday, facing a growing storm, Bytedance was briefing journalists - including the BBC - that the suspension of the account was nothing to do with Feroza's activism on behalf of the Uighurs. Instead, it was because 10 days earlier she had posted a video featuring Osama Bin Laden, infringing TikTok's rules on terrorism. On the face of it, this sounded serious. But then it emerged that the video in question was a jokey piece about the assumptions people made about the boys Feroza might date, ending with a one-second photo of Bin Laden. Feroza explained that as a Muslim growing up in America she had been ridiculed, called a terrorist and ""Bin Laden's wife"", and she had decided to respond with humour. Her first account had been taken down because of the satirical video, so she had started a new account. ""I made multiple posts on it and nothing happened. Right when I posted about the Uighurs in China, my account was suspended."" Suspicion of Chinese companies Despite her suspension, the video continued to attract views and the row seemed to be dying down - until early on Thursday when it disappeared for just under an hour. Bytedance blamed this on human error by a moderator and once again stressed that it did not censor political content. ""It's important to clarify that nothing in our community guidelines precludes content such as this video, and it should not have been removed,"" the company said. While China has a number of extremely successful and popular social media services, TikTok is the first to make much of an impact outside Asia. It was after Bytedance paid $1bn (£770m) for the Musical.ly video app in 2017 that its ambitions to become a force in the United States and Europe became clear. But since then, suspicion of Chinese companies - particularly in the United States - has hardened. Now, politicians are asking whether that sale should ever have been allowed to proceed. TikTok is growing rapidly and earning very respectable revenues. In recent months, it has been on a hiring spree, taking on a number of seasoned public relations professionals. Now that activists have spotted what a useful platform the video site can be for messages of dissent against the Chinese government, that PR team can expect to be kept very busy.","It is a place where a mostly teenage audience goes to mime to music, share memes and generally have a laugh."
"By Jonathan FildesTechnology reporter, BBC News The social network has launched a trial of a feature called Questions, which allows people to pose queries to the site's 500 million users. The service has been rolled out to a select group of Facebook members and will ""evolve over time"", the site said. It will go head-to-head with other services such as Yahoo Answers, Twitter and search engines such as ask.com. ""The core of search is a question,"" said Danny Sullivan, editor-in-chief of the blog Search Engine Land. ""For thousands of years we asked questions of people that we trusted. ""Then around 15 years ago we underwent an incredible revolution with the arrival of search engines."" Mr Sullivan said Questions was a return to this age of more personalised search. ""You can now put questions out there in a way we used to do before everyone was online,"" he said. Expensive business Earlier this year, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg said that the future of the web was one where friends, or what he called ""your social graph"", guide you online. Many interpreted this as a direct challenge to the dominance of Google's automated search. However, said Mr Sullivan, Questions was not going ""to kill Google"". ""It's very difficult to challenge Google as general search leader,"" he said. ""Indexing and ranking the web is very expensive and Facebook has no skills in doing that. ""But what they do have is social connections, which allows users to put out those questions to others who they trust."" The new feature allows people to quiz the entire Facebook community by clicking on the ""Ask Question"" button. ""Keep in mind that all questions and answers posted using the Questions application are public and visible to everyone on the internet,"" said Blake Ross of the firm in a blog post. ""If you only want to ask a question to your friends or a specific group of people, you can still pose it as a status update on your profile targeted to those people."" Users can also create polls, add photos to questions and tag them with a specific topic. ""The questions you ask will be shown to people who have expressed interest in the particular topics you tag, as well as to your friends and friends of friends,"" Mr Ross wrote. However, Nate Elliott, Principal Analyst at research firm Forrester, said he did not think that entering the search market was Facebook's main motivation for launching the feature. ""It is looking to generate more data on its users,"" he told BBC News. ""The more they can get people to raise their hands and say 'I want to know more about a subject' or 'I am an expert in a topic', the more it allows them to target marketing and advertising. ""Whenever it does anything new these days, you have to ask how does it help them collect more data and learn more about its users.""",Facebook has made its first steps into the search market.
"By Tom EspinerTechnology reporter A technology called eLoran has been turned on to help navigation if Sat-nav based systems (aka GPS) fail or are jammed. The General Lighthouse Authority (GLA) has turned on a radio station which broadcasts fine-tuned eLoran signals. Ships fitted with eLoran receivers will now be able to use the backup radio signal to reach port. Longwave alternative The eLoran technology is based around longwave radio signals that are broadcast from nine separate stations in Northwest England, France, Germany, and the Faroe Islands. Now added to this is a GLA station in Dover that broadcasts corrections to eLoran that makes signals so precise ships can enter harbours using them in the event of GPS failure. In a statement shipping minister Stephen Hammond said the technology should improve navigational safety in ""the busiest shipping channel in the world"". Maritime navigational instruments tend to rely on GPS positioning which employs timing signals broadcast by a constellation of satellites. However, GPS signals can fail or be fooled by a conflicting radio signal, said Professor David Last, an advisor to the to General Lighthouse Authority. ""The problem is, many vessels are wholly dependent on GPS, "" Prof Last told the BBC. ""GPS can and does go wrong."" GPS signals are weak, and so can be disrupted by solar storms, or by a stronger signal broadcast in the vicinity by a GPS jammer. Compact GPS jammers that run from a car are available to buy, although use is prohibited. GPS is used to determine a ship's position and direction, and for communications. All ship's instrumentation is integrated, so if anything goes wrong, the systems can completely fail. GPS can be disrupted by a weak signal broadcast on the same frequency, said Prof Last. The weak signal can cause a ship's instruments to gradually drift out of true, without setting off any alarms, leaving the ship in a different position to where it ""thinks"" it is. ""The ship will drift away from its true position, and slowly start to turn,"" said Prof Last. ""It's insidious."" eLoran is not widely used on commercial shipping, although an eLoran receiver has been installed on a new P&O Ferries ship, called the ""Spirit of Britain"".",Ships traversing the busy Dover Strait now have more help to work out where they are and avoid other vessels.
"Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent@BBCRoryCJon Twitter It is a campaign to raise $500,000 to fund a new smart watch - and just half an hour after it was launched it had raced through its target. The last time I looked, it was racing towards $3m in 90 minutes. Great, you might think, a smart new start-up has found that it can harness the power of the crowd to fund technology that venture capitalists might be loathe to back. But actually this is Pebble, a business which was a scrappy upstart a couple of years ago but has since raised at least $15m (£10m) from investors. Pebble was the original Kickstarter success story. Its young founders turned to the crowdfunding platform to fund their original smartwatch in 2012, eventually raising $10m after setting a target of $100,000. The company helped promote the whole idea of testing the appeal of new technology by showing a prototype to an online audience to see how many snapped it up. It also changed the direction of an organisation whose original aim was to promote artistic enterprises. Kickstarter still bills itself as new way to fund creative projects, ""everything from films, games, and music to art, design, and technology"". But since Pebble came along, it's the technology projects that have grabbed the limelight. What it isn't, according to a blogpost from Kickstarter in 2012, is a store. It shouldn't be simply a marketplace for finished products but ""a new way for creators and audiences to work together to make things"". But the Pebble Time doesn't look like a work in progress, to be refined through interaction with its backers. Indeed, now that it has hit its target, backers are told that their watches should be delivered in May. Not much time for any new thinking about the product. Now, of course, it's up to Kickstarter's founders to decide where they want to take it. But if it is turning into just another online shop window for established businesses, that may mean less money for risky new ventures and less creativity. I put some of these points to Kickstarter, and the organisation has come back with a statement insisting that technology has always been part of its creative brief. ""We don't see a smartwatch as being any less of a creative endeavour than a dance performance, and we love being a place where people can embrace innovation,"" it said. Kickstarter says it has always been about more than raising funds -""it's also about building that base of people who want to follow whatever it is you do next. That's something that just doesn't happen in a store."" It is in that context that it sees Pebble's latest smartwatch as completely in tune with its mission to involve a community in the creation and distribution of new products. But here's a question - what if an Apple or a Samsung or a Google decided to launch a new product on the crowdfunding site? Those companies have people who want to follow whatever they do next too - but would they fit into the Kickstarter template?","This afternoon I've been staring, mesmerised, at a Kickstarter page ."
"Peter Nash helped run the chat forums on the site that let people buy and sell illegal drugs and other illicit goods and services. The Silk Road was shut down in October 2013, following raids by the FBI and other law enforcement agencies. Mr Nash could face life in prison when he is sentenced in May. Arrested in Brisbane in December 2013, Mr Nash was extradited to the US in November 2014 to face trial for his alleged role in running the Silk Road site. The Silk Road was hosted on the Tor network to help hide it from the authorities and to make it easier for people to use anonymously. The US Department of Justice alleges that the founder of the Silk Road, Ross Ulbricht, paid Mr Nash up to $75,000 (£50,000) a year for administering the discussion forums on the site. The forums on the Silk Road, said the DoJ, had helped visitors to the site find and buy drugs and other illegal services. Over the two and a half years that the Silk Road was running, it had helped drug dealers sell hundreds of kilograms of their wares to more than 100,000 buyers, said the DoJ. In addition, said the agency, millions of dollars had been laundered via the site, which only accepted payment in bitcoins. Mr Nash, known online as samesamebutdifferent, said he had become involved with the site when buying drugs for friends. ""I deeply regret my conduct and any consequent harm I caused,"" said Mr Nash at his hearing. He added that he had never found out the real identity of Ross Ulbricht, who founded the site. In February this year, Ulbricht was found guilty of conspiracy to traffic drugs and launder money as well as hack computers. He is planning to appeal against the verdict. Two other alleged former Silk Road staff members are also facing trial. Andrew Jones pleaded guilty on 2 October 2014 and is due to be sentenced later this year. Gary Davis is currently on bail in Ireland awaiting the conclusion of extradition proceedings.",An Australian man who helped run the underground Silk Road website has pleaded guilty to money laundering and drugs trafficking charges in the US.
"Mr Dotcom ran Megaupload, a file storage site that authorities claimed was being used to store and share films and other content illegally. The next hearing would be in February 2015, Mr Dotcom said on Monday. He is currently on bail and living in New Zealand. He has denied the charges. The reason for the latest extradition hearing delay is not yet known. Mr Dotcom's mansion home was raided by US and New Zealand authorities in January 2012. The 40-year-old was arrested on the roof of his home, but has since been involved in a bitter back-and-forth relationship with New Zealand's courts, its politicians and figures in the entertainment industry. Earlier this year, a New Zealand court ruled that the raid was legal, but that the US's cloning of electronic evidence was not. Civil lawsuits More recently, the court decided that Mr Dotcom did not have to hand over access codes to hard-drives seized in the raid. Additionally, the entertainment industry has launched multiple lawsuits to run alongside the criminal case. One, from a number of film studios, alleges that Mr Dotcom cost the industry $500m (£320m) in lost revenue. Mr Dotcom told the BBC earlier this year that he believed the civil lawsuits were a sign the industry believed the criminal case was faltering. Since his arrest, Mr Dotcom has launched a new file storage site, Mega, and his own political party. The Internet Party has since merged with an existing group in the country to become #InternetMana. A general election is set to be held in the country on 20 September.","An extradition hearing for Kim Dotcom, who stands accused of ""massive"" piracy, has again been delayed."
"By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor StopCovid France is designed to prevent a second wave of infections by using smartphone logs to warn users if they have been near someone who later tested positive for the virus. But a last-minute launch delay led some citizens to download the wrong product. England has yet to confirm when its own app will roll out nationwide. Health Secretary Matt Hancock had originally said it would be by 1 June, and then later suggested it would be around the middle of next week. But the BBC has learned that it is now unlikely to be before 15 June and could be as late as the start of July. That is in part because of delays in releasing a second version of the software to the Isle of Wight, where it is being trialled. The update will add symptoms including the loss of taste and smell to a self-diagnosis questionnaire next week, or soon after. It will also start giving at-risk users a code to enter into a separate website when they book a medical test. This will allow the result, saying whether they tested positive or negative, to be delivered back to them via the app. Rival models Both the UK and France have created apps of their own based on a ""centralised"" design. By contrast, Latvia, Italy and Switzerland have released apps based on a ""decentralised"" technology developed by Apple and Google. Advocates of the centralised approach says it gives epidemiologists more data to analyse, helping them better target the contagion alerts. They are also not limited by rules imposed by the two tech companies, such as a ban on being able to gather location data. Supporters of the decentralised model say it better protects users' anonymity and privacy. StopCovid France's rollout has caused controversy. Hundreds of academics signed a letter in April raising concerns that gathered data could be repurposed for mass surveillance purposes. There was then a row over the government's refusal to give MPs a vote on the matter, which was only resolved after ministers gave the Senate and National Assembly non-binding votes. They both ultimately gave the app the green light. And the country's data privacy watchdog also approved the rollout after carrying out its own review, although it did ask for some changes to the app's wording. But questions remain about how many people will voluntarily install it - the more that do so, the better it should work. Digital Minister Cedric O indicated that he was pleased with the initial uptake. ""As of this morning, 600,000 people managed to download the app, so it's a very very good start,"" he told the TV channel France 2. ""We are very happy with his start, but obviously several million French people need to have it."" He declined to give an exact target. But he had previously said a publicity campaign would initially focus on city-dwellers - particularly those using public transport, restaurants and supermarkets at peak times - as they were among those most likely to spread Covid-19. Hours late The French government had said the app would be released at midday on Tuesday. But StopCovid France did not appear on Google Play until late on Tuesday afternoon, and then a few hours later on Apple's App Store. One consequence of this was that a Catalan health information app with a similar name - Stop Covid19 CAT - was mistakenly downloaded by many in the interim, causing it to briefly top France's download charts. The only explanation given for the delay was that last-minute ""technical adjustments"" had to be made. Contact tracing apps are supposed to complement work done by humans quizzing those diagnosed with the disease. It remains unclear whether the limitations of relying on Bluetooth can be overcome to avoid capturing too many false flags. Baroness Dido Harding, who heads up the government's Test and Trace programme, said little new about the app when she appeared before the House of Commons' Health and Social Care Committee, beyond saying it was a ""high priority"" to link it to medical test results. But Prof Christophe Fraser, who advises the NHS on the project, told MPs there was a ""need for speed"". An app, he explained, could still be used to serve users amber warnings - perhaps advising them not to visit an elderly relative or a friend in a vulnerable group - while their contact awaited a result. ""The app provides the best early warning system by enabling us to record close physical contact with people we know, but also those we don't know or can't remember,"" the Oxford Big Data Institute academic told the BBC. ""Our latest analyses suggest that even at low levels of uptake, the app will have a protective effect across a localised network of contacts - if you, your friends, colleagues and family download the app, you're creating a local alert network within your community."" But it is still not clear whether other parts of the UK will adopt it. Earlier, Northern Ireland's chief scientific advisor told the Stormont Health Committee that he planned to focus on manual contact tracing, saying he thought the app's usefulness had been overstated. ""At best, it is an adjunct,"" Prof Ian Young said. The Health Minister Robin Swann added that he had concerns that the app would be unattractive to users because of concerns about it draining battery life, and that people at the end of a phone were already proving effective.","France's digital minister has said its coronavirus contact-tracing app has been downloaded 600,000 times since it became available on Tuesday afternoon."
"Images of the figures were published online by the website Gawker. They show operating losses of more than $100m (£65m) in the second quarter of 2014, albeit coupled with steady growth in revenue. In a statement, the company hit back at reports but did not deny them.""Shock, horror, Uber makes a loss,"" it said. ""This is hardly news, and old news at that,"" it added. ""It's a case of business 101: you raise money, you invest money, you grow (hopefully), you make a profit and that generates a return for investors."" The company was recently valued at $50bn and is the most-funded start-up in the world. There has long been speculation over the health of Uber's profit to loss ratio, a subject on which the company has never officially detailed the sums. Positive note One positive note to emerge was the fact that the company increased its cash holdings from $263m in 2013 to over $1bn the following year. Uber has faced a string of difficulties this summer, including the arrest of two managers in France over allegations that the service was ""illegal"" there, and the imposition of a $7.3m fine in California after the company failed to provide detailed information about itself to regulators. The car-sharing app has also been banned in a number of cities and countries around the world, including Spain, Thailand, several Indian cities and faces partial bans in Germany and the Netherlands.","Financial documents, allegedly from car-share start-up Uber, suggest the firm is running at losses of several million dollars each quarter."
"Carl Reimer, a professional streamer, accidentally fired his gun while brandishing it as a joke. Reimer said he thought he had emptied the bullets from the Glock pistol. ""I was clearly intoxicated, but the fact of the matter is... guns are not a toy. They are not to be messed with,"" he said later, in a filmed apology. Reimer is a popular personality on YouTube and Twitter, and had more than 100,000 followers on Twitch - the Amazon-owned live streaming platform - before being suspended. In the live footage, Reimer is seen playing Call of Duty, before pausing to pretend to threaten someone with his handgun. He appeared to empty the chamber, but a bullet remained. No-one was harmed in the incident in which the bullet tore through a metal cup, ricocheted and destroyed a computer monitor. Shortly afterwards, Reimer's channel on Twitch was suspended. His gaming team, SoaR, also tweeted that it had dropped him. In an apology video posted to YouTube, Reimer said he deserved the backlash. ""It's a mistake, but it's a mistake that could have cost somebody their life,"" he said. ""I'm so broken about this."" He said he had bought the gun for personal protection - and should not have been handling it for entertainment purposes. ""I made my biggest mistake of my entire life last night, and it could ruin my life,"" he said. ""I could have hurt somebody, I could have hurt myself, I could have hurt one of my animals - and that's unforgivable."" ""I'm not in SoaR anymore, and that is rightfully so. I hope you guys know I have no hatred toward them or anything like that... they did what they needed to do because I'm an idiot."" Fans on his YouTube channel praised Reimer for taking responsibility for his actions. Twitch's community guidelines say that brandishing lethal weapons is a ""zero tolerance"" violation, though the guidelines centre on violent or threatening behaviour. A suspension or ban can be devastating for a streamer's career, in a market where regular streaming is key to retaining a loyal fan-base of subscribers. One of the world's most popular streamers, Ninja, said he lost 40,000 Twitch subscribers when he took a two-day break in 2018. Like many, Reimer relies on his fan-base to make a living. He claims he had streamed every day for the past three or four years. He told his fans he really appreciated ""all the support over the years"", adding that he was ""really sorry"". ""You can entertain people - without doing something so stupid,"" he lamented. ""It's OK to have a gun on stream, but it's not OK to discharge it. It's not OK.""",A video-game streamer has been suspended from Twitch and dropped from his e-sports team after accidentally firing a gun while broadcasting live.
"Three providers of Virtual Private Network (VPN) systems reported that updates to China's firewall had hindered people using their services. The providers affected are Astrill, StrongVPN and Golden Frog. Many Chinese people use VPNs to visit websites outside the country that they would not be able to reach without the aid of such tools. Sites blocked in China include services operated by web giants such as Google, Facebook and Twitter. China operates a very sophisticated net censorship system that both limits the places people can go online and what they can search for and discuss. A VPN works by setting up a dedicated, encrypted link between a person's computer and the website or service they want to use and makes spying on the data flowing across the connection difficult. Chinese state media said the blocks had been imposed ""for safety"". Reuters reported that a cybersecurity expert at a state-backed think tank said the upgrades to the nation's firewall had been carried out to preserve China's ""cyberspace sovereignty"". The renewed attempt to stifle use of VPNs comes as the ruling Communist party seeks to clamp down on corruption by top officials, Prof Xiao Qiang from Berkeley's School of Information told AP. The clampdown was ""a very clearly related fact with the amount of political rumours and information related to China's high politics showing up in websites outside of China,'' he said. The services that have been hit are almost exclusively used by individuals and are often accessed via mobile phones. China has not put any restrictions on the use of VPNs inside large corporations. Sunday Yokubaitis, president of the Golden Frog VPN service, told Reuters: ""This week's attack on VPNs that affected us and other VPN providers is more sophisticated than what we've seen in the past."" Despite this, Golden Frog said access to some of its servers was still unimpeded. StrongVPN said via its blog that it was ""working diligently"" to restore access to servers it had in China. In addition, it said customers should attempt to connect at non-peak hours to limit the load on its network.",China has blocked several popular services that let citizens skirt state censorship systems.
"By Pia GadkariBusiness reporter, BBC News In the UK, the number of people killed in cycling accidents is on the rise. Most serious incidents involve another vehicle and commonly occur when the cyclist is travelling straight ahead and another vehicle turns into it, research suggests. That's why Emily Brooke, founder of Blaze, says she designed a light that projects an image of a green bike onto the ground about 5 metres (16ft) ahead of the cyclist. 'Lit like a Christmas tree' Blaze uses a laser to project the bike symbol on the ground. It is also fully waterproof and comes in a sleek aluminium case with a backlit control panel. ""It's vehicles travelling in the same direction as you that cross your path who would see this light,"" Ms Brooke says. ""This helps in your classic blind-spot scenario. ""You can be lit up like a Christmas tree and have every light on the market, but ultimately if you're in the vehicle's blind spot, you're still invisible."" ""They see this light and don't turn."" At FlyKly, which makes electrically-assisted bike wheels, Niko Klansek says safety concerns are a key reason why people choose not to cycle. During a campaign on crowdfunding site Kickstarter to raise cash for the ""smartwheel"", many people asked for it to be available in fluorescent colours so that they could be seen more easily from the side. ""Otherwise the usual lights are just at the front and back,"" Mr Klansek says. ""But it's really important to be seen from the side too."" 'Outstanding design flaw' Cycling safety expert Ian Walker, of the University of Bath, agrees, saying anything cyclists can do to make themselves more visible to drivers - such as wearing reflectives and lights, especially in the dark - is an advantage for them. But former professional cyclist Michael Hutchinson says many people do not use safety equipment because they do not like the look of it. ""The most outstanding design flaw with the traditional polystyrene helmet is that it messes up people's hair, it's sweaty on the head,"" Mr Hutchinson says. ""Also a lot of people don't like the look of bike helmets."" Niko Klansek, of FlyKly, agrees, saying that if people could cycle without breaking a sweat many more would use one to get to work. ""They want to dress for their destination, not for the bike ride,"" Mr Klansek says of his customers. 'Invisible' helmet Anna Haupt, co-founder of Hovding, says she encountered the same sort of resistance to wearing helmets. ""People told us they wanted an 'invisible' cycle helmet,"" she says. ""We heard it over and over again, that people did not want to wear helmets because it ruined their hair."" Hovding's airbag-style head gear stays folded inside a neck collar until the moment it detects an accident taking place. Once the collar is switched on it uses six sensors to monitor the body's movements 200 times per second, registering both the angles and speed of the neck. During the ride, the helmet keeps track of the readings - ready to release the airbag if it receives a single data point that falls outside the normal range. ""If you happen to be in an accident, your body movements will be completely different from normal cycling,"" Ms Haupt explains. ""An icy road produces more angular adjustments, and if you get hit by a car it's a very obvious acceleration in your body,"" she says. But Dr Ian Walker says it isn't only cyclists that have a mental block about helmets. While they are an important protection if an accident takes place, seeing bikers wearing a helmet can actually cause some motorists to drive less carefully around them, he says. Reflexes 'too slow' Ulf Bjornstig, Professor of Surgery at Umea University, says that in Sweden cyclists are in more accidents than any other type of road user. Head injuries are the most common, with 10% of victims suffering concussion or becoming unconscious, he says. ""The head hits the ground quite hard. If we look at non-fatal injuries, quite often you land on the ground with your face - nose, chin."" But in the case of fatal accidents, ""those victims are often hit from behind or the side,"" Prof Bjornstig says. ""That's the difference between fatal and non-fatal injuries."" Jurij Lozic, in Slovenia, who recently completed a Kickstarter campaign for a bendy mudguard originally designed for fixed-gear bikes, says style and aesthetics are very important in making a product sell. His Musguard fenders are die cut from recyclable polypropylene - a common kind of plastic sheeting - and come in a range of bright colours. ""People want beautiful products to enhance their bikes,"" Mr Lozic explains. Preventing future accidents? But as appealing as some accessories may be, former professional cyclist Michael Hutchinson is sceptical that the average biker would be willing to spend large sums solving the problem. The Hovding helmet costs nearly 400 euros (£330) while the Blaze bike light can be pre-ordered for £125. Mr Hutchinson adds that he fears accessories such as helmets are something of a ""distraction"" in the bigger picture of improving cyclist safety. ""At a fundamental level, helmets will not prevent a single accident,"" he says. Dr Ian Walker agrees, saying that when it comes to preventing accidents, ""nothing is going to get safer than hard segregation of cyclists and motorists"".","Although more people are getting around by bike, cyclists remain the most vulnerable group of road users. Could a range of wearable technologies keep them safer?"
"By Tom EspinerTechnology reporter Crown-of-thorns starfish have have been described as a significant threat to coral. The Cotsbot robot, which has a vision system, is designed to seek out starfish and give them a lethal injection. After it eradicates the bulk of starfish in a given area, human divers can move in and mop up the survivors. Field trials of the robot have begun in Moreton Bay in Brisbane to refine its navigation system, Queensland University of Technology researcher Matthew Dunbabin told the BBC. There are no crown-of-thorns starfish in Moreton Bay but once the navigation has been refined, the robot will be unleashed on the reef. ""Later this month we begin deploying the robot in the Great Barrier Reef to evaluate our state-of-the-art vision-based crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) detection system,"" he said. ""Over the next five months we plan to progressively increase the level of autonomy the robot is allowed, leading to autonomous detection and injection of the starfish."" The technology has two key components - an image recognition system and the robot submersible. ""The core of the detection is a state-of-the-art computer vision and machine learning system,"" Mr Dunbabin said. ""This system has been trained to recognise COTS [crown-of-thorns starfish] from among a vast range of corals using thousands of still images of the reef and videos taken by COTS-eradicating divers."" Since the 1960s, the movement of nutrients from the land into the sea has meant that starfish numbers are growing and destroying large areas of reef, the researchers said.","An autonomous starfish-killing robot is close to being ready for trials on the Great Barrier Reef, researchers say."
"It said that average fixed-line download speeds rose by 28% over the year to 46.2 megabits per second, while uploads gained by 44% to 6.2 Mbps. It added that the typical household now consumed 190 gigabytes of data a month, in large part due to the use of Netflix and other streamed TV services. But rural consumers still lag behind. Ofcom said: The regulator said the primary reasons for the discrepancy were less availability and reduced take-up of cable and fibre services in the countryside. Later this month, internet service providers will be obliged to quote average peak-time speeds in their adverts and other promotional materials, rather than the ""up to"" figures that have been more common. Time to switch The report's numbers were generated by installing speed-testing boxes at about 4,700 volunteers' properties in November. Ofcom has also broken down its results by nation, revealing that England had the fastest speeds while Wales had the slowest: The watchdog highlighted that many households could improve their speeds at no extra cost by asking to be switched to fibre where it was available. It noted that 93% of UK properties now had access to superfast services but said that about 40% still subscribed to a copper-based ""standard"" ADSL (asymmetric digital subscriber line) package. The report also highlighted that Virgin Media - the UK's biggest cable provider - had made improvements, particularly over the peak evening period. Ofcom ascribed this to an investment in additional network capacity, although the Thinkbroadband news site noted that a critical BBC Watchdog investigation was likely to have spurred matters on. Virgin's ""up to 200 Mbps"" package was singled out for delivering the fastest measured download speeds, averaging 193.6 Mbps over a 24-hour period. But Ofcom noted that the firm had launched an even faster 300 Mbps deal in 2017. However, too few of its volunteers had subscribed to generate a report.","There has been a marked improvement in home broadband, according to an annual survey by the UK's communications watchdog Ofcom."
"Internet providers BT and TalkTalk demanded the judicial review, arguing that the legislation was rushed through parliament without proper debate. They claim that the measures unnecessarily impact users' privacy and force ISPs to police copyright infringement on the net. If the court finds in their favour, the act would no longer be enforceable. ""It is a big deal to be judicially reviewing primary legislation but we took advice and there were very clearly were some real problems,"" said Simon Milner, BT's head of industry policy. ""It might find that it is all fine - I'd be surprised if it was - but we are going to court to get legal clarity,"" he added. Letter campaign The courts will consider whether the act is in line with European legislation, in particular as it relates to users' privacy and the role of ISPs. The previous government brought in the tough measures to deal with the growing issue of internet piracy. Under the current legislation, content providers will have to monitor peer-to-peer networks for illegal activity and collate the IP addresses - the numerical code that links a particular computer network to an illegally downloaded file. They can then apply to a court to force ISPs to surrender the real world address that is connected to that IP address. Letters could then be sent to alleged net pirates, advising them that their computer connection has been used in illegal activity. The creative industry is keen that the emphasis will be on education initially, although people will go on a blacklist which could in future be used to take individual infringers to court. Other penalties, such as slowing down net connections or even cutting people off from the net entirely have not been ruled out, but would need additional legislation. The letter-writing strategy bears similarities to the tactics of discredited law firm ACS: Law, which sent over 10,000 letters to alleged net pirates. Unlike content providers, which will not be levying fines, ACS: Law collected some £300,000 from people - who were charged an average of £500 per infringement. Not everyone paid up and 27 cases recently went to court in highly controversial circumstances. Lead solicitor Andrew Crossley attempted to discontinue the cases shortly before the hearing was due and was accused of obstructing the court process. In the middle of the case, Mr Crossley said he no longer wanted to be in the business of chasing net pirates and the cases were eventually thrown out. But he faces an investigation for his conduct from the Solicitors' Regulation Authority and could be hit with legal costs for the cases he brought. Yesterday's game During the court case, doubt was cast over whether an IP address was suitable evidence of wrong-doing as it does not identify the individual user - only the location of their connection. Consumer watchdog Which? highlighted several cases where people claimed to have been wrongly accused. Charles Dunstone, chairman of TalkTalk, thinks the same thing will happen if the government's measures go ahead. ""Innocent broadband customers will suffer and citizens will have their privacy invaded,"" he said. Jim Killock, director of the Open Rights Group, said that he is particularly worried about how the legislation will affect public wi-fi hotspots. ""We need to start again and find a new policy settlement which embraces, rather than tramples on, the exciting possibilities that the digital age offers,"" he said. John McVay, chief executive of PACT (Producers Alliance for Cinema and TV), who will represent the UK's creative industries at the judicial review, defended the act. ""The Digital Economy Act is the result of many years of consultation and presents a reasonable and balanced solution,"" he said. But Mark Mulligan, an analyst with Forrester Research, warned that even if the act remains intact, the measures won't work because they are already out-of-date. ""Peer-to-peer file-sharing is yesterday's game. People now are going off the network where they won't be detected - swapping hard-drives, and getting music via blogs and upload sites,"" he said.",Parts of the Digital Economy Act that deal with illegal file-sharing are being challenged in the High Court.
"Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent@BBCRoryCJon Twitter My question to Professor Hawking about artificial intelligence comes in the context of the work done by machine learning experts at the British firm Swiftkey, who have helped upgrade his communications system. So I talk to Swiftkey's co-founder and chief technical officer, Ben Medlock, a computer scientist with a Cambridge doctorate which focuses on how software can understand nuance in language. Ben Medlock told me that Professor Hawking's intervention should be welcomed by anyone working in artificial intelligence: ""It's our responsibility to think about all of the consequences good and bad"", he told me. ""We've had the same debate about atomic power and nanotechnology. With any powerful technology there's always the dialogue about how do you use it deliver the most benefit and how it can be used to deliver the most harm."" He is, however sceptical about just how far along the path to full artificial intelligence we are. ""If you look at the history of AI, it has been characterised by over-optimism. The founding fathers, including Alan Turing, were overly optimistic about what we'd be able to achieve."" He points to some successes in single complex tasks, such as using machines to translate foreign languages. But he believes that replicating the processes of the human brain, which is formed by the environment in which it exists, is a far distant prospect: ""We dramatically underestimate the complexity of the natural world and the human mind, ""he explains. ""Take any speculation that full AI is imminent with a big pinch of salt."" While Medlock is not alone in thinking it's far too early to worry about artificial intelligence putting an end to us all, he and others still see ethical issues around the technology in its current state. Google, which bought the British AI firm DeepMind earlier this year, has gone as far as setting up an ethics committee to examine such issues. DeepMind's founder Demis Hassabis told Newsnight earlier this year that he had only agreed to sell his firm to Google on the basis that his technology would never be used for military purposes. That, of course, will depend in the long-term on Google's ethics committee, and there is no guarantee that the company's owners won't change their approach 50 years from now. The whole question of the use of artificial intelligence in warfare has been addressed this week in a report by two Oxford academics. In a paper called Robo-Wars: The Regulation of Robotic Weapons, they call for guidelines on the use of such weapons in 21st Century warfare. ""I'm particularly concerned by situations where we remove a human being from the act of killing and war,"" says Dr Alex Leveringhaus, the lead author of the paper. He says you can see artificial intelligence beginning to creep into warfare, with missiles that are not fired at a specific target: ""A more sophisticated system could fly into an area and look around for targets and could engage without anyone pressing a button."" But Dr Leveringhaus, a moral philosopher rather than a computer scientist, is cautious about whether there is anything new about these dilemmas. He points out that similar ethical questions have been raised at every stage of automation, from the arrival of artillery allowing the remote killing of enemy soldiers to the removal of humans from manufacturing by mechanisation. Still, he welcomes Stephen Hawking's intervention: ""We need a societal debate about AI. It's a matter of degree."" And that debate is given added urgency by the sheer pace of technological change. This week the UK government has announced three driverless car pilot projects, and Ben Medlock of Swiftkey sees an ethical issue with autonomous vehicles. ""Traditionally we have a legal system that deals with a situation where cars have human agents,"" he explains. ""When we have driverless cars we have autonomous agents... You can imagine a scenario when a driverless car has to decide whether to protect the life of someone inside the car or someone outside."" Those kind of dilemmas are going to emerge in all sorts of areas where smart machines now get to work with little or no human intervention. Stephen Hawking's theory about artificial intelligence making us obsolete may be a distant nightmare, but nagging questions about how much freedom we should give to intelligent gadgets are with us right now.","The end of the human race - that is what is in sight if we develop full artificial intelligence, according to Stephen Hawking in an interview with the BBC . But how imminent is the danger and if it is remote, do we still need to worry about the implications of ever smarter machines?"
"The update comes after YouTube made changes to the way videos were monetised, to stop ads appearing alongside extremist content. The changes prompted complaints from some popular vloggers, saying it made it hard for them to earn money. The improved algorithm should mean more videos were classified as suitable for ads, YouTube said. Millions more In April and May this year, YouTube acted after investigations revealed that ads for big brands were being regularly shown on racist videos or those that encouraged violence against particular groups. One consequence of the changes was that videos created by many popular YouTubers no longer ran with ads because the algorithm flagged them as not being ""family friendly"". High-profile YouTubers criticised the site for the way it had handled the changes. Many said they had been left confused about what criteria would lead to a video no longer getting ads. In response, YouTube created a system that let creators appeal if the algorithm decided that they could not monetise a video. Humans reviewed the decision to see if a video had been wrongly classified. In a blog, the company said it had taken information from the appeals made over the past few months to update its algorithm so it correctly classified more videos. ""As a result, there will be a 30% reduction in the number of videos receiving limited ads as they move to being fully monetised,"" said YouTube. ""In other words, millions more videos will become fully monetised."" Anyone who believed videos were still being wrongly classified should continue to appeal, so the algorithm could continue to be trained, it said.",YouTube is tweaking the way it chooses which videos will have adverts shown with them.
"By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor The market research firm says 4% fewer handsets were sold in the months of April, May and June compared with the same period in 2014. It suggests the market has ""reached saturation"" - meaning about half the population owns a smartphone and is not upgrading on an annual basis. However, not all manufacturers experienced a drop. Samsung's sales were 49% lower - despite the launch of its Galaxy S6 models- and Lenovo also experienced a big fall-off in demand. But Apple's sales rose 68%, even though it did not have new phones out. Huawei took the top spot in its home country with a 46% growth in sales. Gartner research director Anshul Gupta said: ""Samsung is down significantly, not just in China, but in other markets as well. ""And the Chinese players have taken a significant lead in their home market."" Samsung's figures will have been affected by problems it had making the S6 Edge's curved screen, which meant the firm could not meet demand. But Mr Gupta stressed that the bigger picture was that overall sales were down for the first time in the country. That, he said, was something that might concern all manufacturers, bearing in mind China accounted for about 30% of global sales, making it the world's biggest market. ""China has reached saturation. Its market is essentially driven by smartphone replacements rather than upgrades from feature phones, so they will follow an 18-month, 24-month, or whatever, replacement cycle."" 'Low-hanging fruit' Another research firm, Strategy Analytics, recently reported China's smartphone sales had eked out 3% growth in the April-to-June period - so, Gartner's headline finding is not undisputed. But Strategy Analytics' own figure was still significantly down on the 29% growth it reported for the second quarter of 2014. ""The smartphone market in China has been slowing down for several quarters and a lot of the low-hanging fruit has been picked,"" the firm's executive director, Neil Mawston, told the BBC. ""Most people in major cities like Beijing already own a smartphone, and the penetration of smartphones across the general population is approaching 50% or more, which is a relatively high rate."" China's smartphone sales tend to be strongest in the first quarter, when people give presents to mark the Chinese New Year. In addition, many of the highest-profile launches tend to happen in the last five months of the year, so many industry watchers may wish to see further data before accepting that the country's smartphone market is truly in retreat. ""The Chinese economy is also not as strong as it was, and the level of innovation from smartphone-makers is also taking a pause at the moment,"" added Mr Mawston.","Smartphone sales in China have fallen year-on-year for the first time, according to data gathered by Gartner."
"Animal Crossing: New Horizons lets players customise their own island and invite others to visit. Some players in Hong Kong have used the platform to stage protests. Players in mainland China had previously been able to buy foreign editions of the title from online marketplaces. The country's censors strictly regulate video games and had yet to approve the title's formal release in the country. Now, even local sites which had advertised imported copies have removed the listings. It is not clear, however, whether this is because there has been an intervention by the authorities or whether the stores are proactively removing the product. The BBC has asked Nintendo for comment. Virtual protests “Animal Crossing is fast becoming a new way for Hong Kong protesters to fight for democracy!” Joshua Wong, leader of the Hong Kong youth activist group Demosisto, wrote on Twitter last week. Examples include banners that read: ""Free Hong Kong - Revolution Now"". There are also disparaging posts featuring images of Chinese President Xi Jinping and Hong Kong’s chief executive Carrie Lam. Before the virus struck, millions of Hong Kong's residents had participated in anti-government street protests. “After the outbreak of coronavirus, it was difficult to organise physical gatherings,” Mr Wong continued. ""With a new game out, we can have virtual protests and we just have to use our creativity to make a new kind of protest tool."" Players in mainland China have also customised the game with coronavirus-related content, including face masks for the characters, and islands with temperature checkpoints, news site Abacus reported. This is not the first time Hong Kong protesters have made use of video games. In December, they began dressing up characters in Grand Theft Auto Online in related clothing. Prior to that, they shared maps advertising Pokemon Go events to signal where rallies would be held. Trade in Animal Crossing on the mainland still continues to a lesser extent, involving private sales arranged via direct messages among other methods, according to Daniel Ahmad, from the consultants firm Niko Partners. In February, another video game - Plague Inc, in which players spread a deadly virus around the world - was removed from Apple’s Chinese App Store after the local regulator judged the content to be illegal during the coronavirus outbreak.",The Nintendo Switch's current best-selling game has been removed from Chinese online stores after activists used it to criticise the state.
"By Alex HudsonBBC News Internet dating changed all that, with users researching and contacting a potential date before meeting; turning the lonely hearts column into a billion-dollar industry. Over 17% of single internet users have used dating websites according to one recent US survey. But the increase of GPS-enabled smartphones has made online dating much more practical and immediate. A number of apps allow users to see potential partners nearby with a username, photograph and selected details about them. They can then contact each other and arrange to meet in a matter of minutes. ""I think everyone struggles to meet people,"" says Joel Simkhai, CEO of newly-launched app Blendr, promising to make social networks social again. ""We're not re-inventing the wheel here, we're just facilitating a connection that happens a million times a day."" And it does seem like there is a desire to meet people online in the hope that love could be, quite literally, around the corner. Skout, another app available on both iOS and Android platforms, promises users can ""flirt, chat, maybe even find a date"" by using its GPS-enabled service. Currently the most widely-used app of its kind, it has seven million people signed up, with a 60% to 40% split between men and women. 'Sexual promiscuity' Simkhai has previous experience with GPS dating. He is the man behind Grindr, an app targeted at the gay community. With over 2.6 million users - over 100,000 of whom are in London - it is said to be responsible for changing the way gay men meet through the internet. But the service has received criticism for apparently being designed to facilitate casual - often very brief - liaisons. Critics say sites like Grindr promote sexual promiscuity and are ""likely to chip away at the norm and practice of monogamy"". Simkhai says the situation is more complex. ""One of the main reasons people go to Grindr is actually for friendships,"" he says, adding that the platform is neutral and only makes it easier to meet people. It is up to them what they do with it. And with his new app Blendr, he is keen to distance himself from the idea of an app used just to meet people for sex, even though membership is limited to people over the age of 18. ""I think there'll be all kinds of relationships,"" says Simkhai. ""Women and men will use it in all types of ways. I think it's going to be different things for different people."" He says the new app will carry information on hobbies and interests and is geared as much for a straight, married man looking for a poker partner or a woman looking for a tennis team-mate as anything more intimate. But will women want to use it for casual dating? ""A lot of women don't want to reveal their availability too quickly,"" says dating guru James Preece. ""These sort of sites take away the mystery. You open yourself up to a lot of strangers and weirdos."" Safety concerns Conventional dating sites are also getting in on the game - combining dating profiles with GPS services. OKCupid, with its database of eight million members, has recently launched a ""Locals"" service promising the same matchmaking service that it traditionally offers, with an added layer of who is nearby at any moment. ""I hold Grindr up as a model of success. I'm not disparaging them,"" OKCupid CEO Sam Yagan told BetaBeat. ""But their reputation [of being more about casual relationships] and their name in many ways is about something that I think the majority of straight women don't want."" Beyond what women are looking for from a date, others believe that safety concerns could make many, especially women, wary of using the service. There has been much written about the risk of giving away exact GPS locations - even when using check-in applications like Foursquare, GoWalla or new features on Facebook - but most GPS dating sites are keen to stress that they only show how far away someone is. Typically, users are also given control over how precisely their location is displayed. But some believe the older problem of hidden identities and false information being given online is still a big problem. ""There's a big perception that when you meet people on the internet, they are not always who they say they are, that's a really big concern,"" says Louise Ward, features editor of women's weekly More! magazine. ""Even when we talk to [young women] about conventional dating sites, the one thing that puts them off is that people can create false profiles, they're really worried that they meet someone dangerous. ""Although dating is changing and people do meet over social networks, it's going to take a little bit longer for something like this to become the norm."" And perhaps the most important thing is there is still the age-old problem of actually being charming when two people actually arrange a date in real life. ""A lot of men will download these apps in the hope it will increase their chances of meeting women,"" says Preece. ""But if they are shy and can't approach them in the first place, it isn't going to make life any easier once they've met.""","Chances are, that if you were trying to find a date 15 years ago, you would have to be in the same place at the same time."
"By Dave LeeTechnology reporter, Los Angeles There were huge levels excitement on the floor of the Los Angeles Convention Centre - though perhaps the next major event to take place here will surpass it: tickets to Brideworld Expo are still available, if you're interested. Last year, we all knew what was going to be the big story at E3. With Sony and Microsoft launching new consoles, it was obvious what the talking point would be. But in the run up to E3 2014, it was anyone's guess, and as the show draws to a close the arguments over who came out on top have already started. So, here's five things we learnt this week: 1. It's still neck-and-neck in the console race (unless you're Nintendo) Sure, the Xbox One has had a troublesome first year compared to the PlayStation 4's stonking sales. But Microsoft really shouldn't be panicking yet. Its line-up of new titles is relentless - the press conference on Monday was simply game after game after game. We'll have a clearer picture of who is winning by this time next year - at which point some of the bigger titles will have finally been released. The words ""Coming in 2015"" appeared so often during both press events that there was a danger they'd be burnt into the big screens. Not so long ago, the console market used to be a three-horse race - but with the stallions of Microsoft and Sony galloping up ahead, Nintendo is becoming more of a rocking horse. Kids love them, they're good fun to play with for a few moments, but they just don't seem to be going anywhere. Nintendo's new games - Starfox, Super Smash Bros and Zelda, in particular - may keep the Wii U on life support for another year or so yet, but it's fast approaching the point where the firm may need to cut its losses and look to the next console, if indeed it makes one. 2. The games industry still has an issue with women It'll come as no shock that it was mostly men in attendance at E3. But there were plenty of women gamers here, many of whom were left a little frustrated at what was on offer. Take Assassin's Creed, for example. Now well-established as one of the major franchises, the game's next outing will allow up to four people to play together - but only as men. Plans to include a female character were ditched during development, Ubisoft says. The explanation? ""A female character means that you have to redo a lot of animation,"" said James Therien, Ubisoft's director, drawing no sympathy whatsoever. The company has since said there will be ""strong female characters"" featured in the game. But not playable. The highest-profile female lead character at E3 was one we've known about for years - Lara Croft. That's right, unfathomably-boobed, hot-panted posh totty Lara Croft. You'd think, given it's approaching 20 years since Tomb Raider first came out, there would be a bit more invention. Still - there is some hope. According to one count, Nintendo is leading the way with playable female characters, albeit in games that are a little on the silly side. And Sega's latest Alien game sees you play as the daughter of Ellen Ripley, Sigourney Weaver's character in the movies. 3. DIY is all the rage at the moment It is probably (read: definitely) because of the crazily successful Minecraft, but a whole heap of games shown at this year's E3 encourage players to create things themselves. Most ambitious is Project Spark - which has been released on beta for a few months, but now appears to be coming together. In this title, you're given a ""canvas"" on which to essentially make your own game, designing levels and adding gameplay elements as you go. An old favourite, Little Big Planet, is back - and it moves forward its highly enjoyable level-creation feature, now given added oomph thanks to the addition of new characters that will be joining loveable lead character Sackboy. Meanwhile, if you're the sort to watch the Saw films and admire the ingenuity of Jigsaw's traps, Fable Legends may float your boat. Its cunning twist is the ability to play as the ""villain"", setting up obstacles and grief to put the good guys in harm's way. 4. Nobody knows what the next big thing is There'd been an air of hope, during Sony's press conference, that Project Morpheus - the firm's virtual reality headset - was about to get a release date. As it happened, we're still none the wiser as to when this technology will find itself in people's homes. Microsoft, meanwhile, are so far sticking two fingers up to virtual reality, and instead relying on their Kinect motion-tracking device. Or are they? The Kinect has barely had a mention this week, and unlike last year - where Microsoft were encouraging people to experiment and jump about with the new tech - the device was comparably invisible this year. It's been a busy year for Oculus Rift - since E3 2013 it's all changed, what with being bought out by Facebook. Oculus is involved in some high-profile, and very impressive, integrations - notably the remake of Elite, and Alien: Isolation. The latter, with VR, is unnerving to say the least. 5. It's time for the golden oldies to shine once more Like that troubling moment when you discover you now actually enjoy the songs your dad was playing in the car when you were little, gaming fans realised this week that it was the vintage titles that can get them most excited of all. The surprise announcement that adventure game Grim Fandango was to get a remake is the best example - the crowd were almost on their feet (although such was the excitement by that point in the conference, I think PlayStation fans would have cheered a cheese sandwich). It will be remastered for PlayStation 4 - as will some more recent classics, Grand Theft Auto 5 and The Last of Us. Remastering was a big theme for Microsoft too - the four main games in the Halo series will be rereleased in their entirety for Xbox One, including a retouched version of Halo 2. A cynic, however, would say that this nostalgia fest was actually a rather crafty way of deflecting attention away from the fact many of the big new games won't be out for a while.

"The measures include a ban on using icons that are ""confusingly similar"" to that of existing products. The search giant also issued rules on how advertising should appear in apps. Since its launch, the Google Play store has featured a significant number of malicious apps, or counterfeit versions of popular games such as Angry Birds. The new guidelines were announced in an email to developers who have 30 days to make sure their apps comply. Developers who do not comply with the measures could see their products removed from the store. The letter, published in full by the Android Central blog, said Google was ""constantly striving"" to make improvements. ""This requires us to update our policies when we launch new features, like subscription billing, and also when we see unhealthy behaviour, like deceptive app names and spammy notifications."" Dead Trigger Unlike Apple's App Store, Google's staff do not vet submissions to its catalogue, instead using an automated anti-malware system called Bouncer to identify known malware and then letting users flag up bad apps if they make it online. Past examples of apps engaging in ""unhealthy"" behaviour include programs capable of sending sensitive user data to a remote server. As well as dangerous apps, knock-off versions of popular paid products - often games - have frustrated developers. Mobile developer Madfinger Games said piracy issues in the Android store had forced it to make its title, Dead Trigger, free to download. ""At first we intend to make this game available for as many people as possible - that's why it was for as little as buck,"" the company wrote. ""Even for one buck, the piracy rate is soooo giant, that we finally decided to provide Dead Trigger for free."" In an attempt to combat this, Google has said it was ""restricting the use of names or icons confusingly similar to existing system apps in order to reduce user confusion"". It added: ""We are providing more detail on the kinds of dangerous products that are not allowed on Google Play. ""For example, apps that disclose personal information without authorization are not allowed."" 'Good first step' Google said the new guidelines also gave clearer rules on what constituted a violation of its spam policy. A further problem highlighted by users is the proliferation of intrusive and frustrating advertisements within free apps. Google said that it would add a new section to address advertising behaviour within apps. ""First, we make it clear that ads in your app must follow the same rules as the app itself. ""Also, it is important to us that ads don't negatively affect the experience by deceiving consumers or using disruptive behaviour such as obstructing access to apps and interfering with other ads."" The guidelines have been welcomed by many Android developers. ""I think it's one of many steps, but it's a good first step to see them taking this sort of thing seriously,"" said Matthew Kennard, a mobile developer for UK-based One Result. ""Now they've released the Google Nexus phone, and the Nexus tablet, Google are thinking now's the time to get serious.""",Google is attempting to crack down on rogue mobile apps on its Android platform with stricter guidelines for developers.
"Dave LeeNorth America technology reporter The EFF criticised the firm's new Binge On streaming feature, saying it was ""throttling"", meaning artificially slowing-down, download speeds. In response, T-Mobile boss John Legere posted an expletive-filled video on Twitter, raging at the EFF's statement. He referred to opponents of Binge On - which included Google - as ""jerks"", adding: ""Who do they think they are?"" Other comments, using stronger language, were also made. In an open letter posted on Monday, apologised for causing offense - but reiterated his rejection of the EFF's characterization of Binge On. ""[I] apologize for offending EFF and its supporters,"" he wrote. ""Just because we don't completely agree on all aspects of Binge On doesn't mean I don't see how they fight for consumers."" However, he added: ""By now you know that I am a vocal, animated and sometimes foul mouthed CEO. ""I don't filter myself, and you know that no one at T-Mobile filters me either (no, they don't even try). That means I will sometimes incite a bit of a 'social media riot', but I'm not going to apologize for that."" Binge On is a service offered to T-Mobile customers, advertised as a way to watch video from certain sources - such as Netflix - without using up any data allowance whatsoever. Mr Legere described it as a way to let customers watch high-quality video without ""stretching their data bucket"". As part of this, Binge On minimises the download size of videos being watch so they are ""optimised"" for mobile devices. But the EFF described Binge On as a cover for simply slowing down video download speeds across the entire T-Mobile network, lightening the load on its network, but reducing the quality of video content for customers (although T-Mobile says, on a mobile screen, this drop is not noticeable). The EFF ran several tests and discovered that T-Mobile was slowing speeds of every video on the internet, regardless of whether or not it was a service involved in the Binge On service, and even if customers had opted out of Binge On. They argued this meant T-Mobile was acting against net neutrality, the principle that all traffic on the internet be treated equally, regardless of whether it was a video, audio file, or simply a webpage. Supporters of net neutrality say it is vital to prevent a two-tiered internet where rich companies pay internet service providers to allow their content to be downloaded quicker than small companies who may not be able to pay. The EFF has urged the US communications regulator to investigate. But Mr Legere insisted the company was not acting against net neutrality. ""This is one of the reasons that Binge On is a VERY 'pro' net neutrality capability - you can turn it on and off in your MyTMobile account - whenever you want. Turn it on and off at will. Customers are in control. Not T-Mobile. Not content providers. Customers. At all times."" The EFF is calling for this feature to be something customers should have to choose to turn on, rather than actively seek to turn off. Speaking about the open letter, a spokeswoman told the BBC: ""We are grateful for the apology and appreciate Mr Legere recognising our work in fighting for the consumers. ""We too hope to have a discussion with T-Mobile regarding net neutrality and Binge On.""

"By Dave LeeTechnology reporter, BBC News Mobile operators, Culture Secretary Maria Miller and communications regulator Ofcom will discuss bringing forward the allocation of spectrum to allow faster mobile download speeds. Ofcom has told the government that the process could be accelerated to launch 4G networks in many places by May or June. It had been thought that it would take until the end of the year. Ahead of the meeting O2 said that it was hopeful that it could launch 4G services in summer 2013. Ronan Dunne, chief executive of O2, said, ""It's been a very good process and it feels that we've made a lot of progress, so I'm hopeful that we'll have a basis for moving forward."" But he went on to express disappointment that Ofcom had not acted earlier: ""We're pleased that we've made progress but frustrated that it's taken so long"". An Ofcom spokesman responded: ""To suggest that the delay has been caused by anything other than litigation - and the threat of litigation - on behalf of competing companies is inaccurate."" Previously O2 and Vodafone had expressed anger that rival network EE - formerly known as Everything Everywhere - had been given permission to use its existing 1,800MHz spectrum to launch a 4G service earlier. O2 had threatened legal action to prevent EE gaining this advantage. A deal could pave the way for EE to announce its 4G launch date, which could be before the end of this month. 'Clever move' O2 and Vodafone will not be able to offer 4G until other parts of the radio spectrum - including those previously used for analogue television and air traffic control - are freed up and sold off. The UK's fourth biggest network - Three - is set to take over part of EE's 4G spectrum, but is not due to do so until September 2013. Ofcom has said it could bring forward its airwave auction by about a fortnight from its current January date, and then speed up handover of control of the frequencies. That could help shrink EE's period of exclusivity to roughly half a year. However, if the networks decide to pursue a legal challenge the process would be delayed. ""Ofcom made quite a clever move by allowing EE to launch early,"" said Matthew Howett, a telecoms analyst with Ovum. ""Because it's now really set the wheels in motion, and will see the others pull their fingers out."" A source at one major network told the BBC that it was also seeking a guarantee from EE that it would not hinder the operation of Mitco, an organisation that has been set up to deal with the possible interference 4G may have on other signals such as digital television. Mitco will eventually be run jointly by the mobile operators and will be tasked with overseeing the distribution of filters and other equipment to prevent disruption - a scheme which is expected to cost in the region of £180m. iPhone 5 EE gave details of its 4G plans in a lavish press event last month, and said it would offer 4G in 16 UK cities by the end of the year. However, it declined to give a firm date on when the service would be open for use by the public. That delay was in part caused by the fierce negotiations between Ofcom and the other networks. The networks felt aggrieved that EE had been handed a considerable headstart in the 4G race, while the other operators would have to wait until the outcome of an auction before they can try and catch up lost ground. Apple's latest iPhone, which launched the day after EE's 4G event, is available on all the major networks - but only EE is able to offer customers 4G speeds on the handset. Ofcom has defended its decision, saying that to delay EE from launching 4G would have been ""to the detriment of consumers"". In contrast, O2 said they were ""hugely disappointed"" with the decision, while Vodafone said: ""The regulator has shown a careless disregard for the best interests of consumers, businesses and the wider economy."" Ovum's Mr Howett said while EE may appear to have been given the early upper hand, it still has a tricky marketing task ahead if it is to capitalise. ""I think it is about two things,"" he told the BBC. ""One is about what the pricing of 4G is going to be. EE would be be pretty mad to price people out of it, so I suspect it'll be quite competitive. ""The second thing is the iPhone 5 impact. For me and a lot of other people the iPhone 5 was very much an incremental upgrade. If people are in the market for a new phone, and people who were on a two-year contract are looking to upgrade, EE will say 'come to us'.""",A meeting about the UK's roll-out of 4G network services takes place later.
"Hemlis, which means secret in Swedish, will use end-to-end encryption so messages are seen only by the sender and recipient. Peter Sunde said it was a response to governments spying on users' data. The iOS and Android project is quickly approaching its $100,000 (£149,133) funding target. However, Apple and WhatsApp say communications using their services are already ""fully encrypted"". Blackberry is also planning to extend its BBM chat service - which can be made fully secure - to other mobile operating systems.

They also appeared on his Instagram account and were removed but not before they had been copied and shared by other users linking to his account. Throat cut Many of those other Instagram users had left comments on the remaining posts on Brandon Clark's account, urging his followers to view the copied images on their profiles. Then, in an attempt to drown out this spread of the images of Ms Devins's body with her throat cut, other Instagram users started posting photographs of her alive as well as pictures of flowers and animals, using her name as the hashtag. Brandon Clark's Instagram account has now been removed. And the company says it is working with the police and using a combination of technology and reports from users to remove other accounts attempting to spread the images.

In a statement posted on Facebook, Utica police said it appeared the pair had met on Instagram two months ago. They had been to a concert together the previous evening and had argued on their way back. Having received reports from Discord users, officers had been searching for the couple when Brandon Clark had called the emergency services himself and made ""incriminating statements"" as well as ""alluding to the fact that he was going to harm himself"", the police said. The online spread of graphic imagery of this tragic event has chilling echoes with that of the New Zealand shootings just four months ago. On that occasion, the killer streamed live video on Facebook for 17 minutes as he fired at men, women and children at two mosques. Facebook was criticised then for failing to remove all traces of the footage in the immediate aftermath. It said it had removed 1.2 million copies of the video within 24 hours and blocked a further 300,000. But stills and clips still spread, cropping up all over social media, sometimes used as profile photos.

"By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor The developer's most recent title was the PlayStation VR release Rigs. Prior to that it had worked on Killzone, LittleBigPlanet and MediEvil games. The studio has been in existence for 19 years. A spokeswoman for Sony said about 50 people were currently employed there. She added that all staff were at risk of being made unemployed. ""It is regrettable that this decision will lead to compulsory redundancies,"" Sony said in a statement. ""Whilst we accept that this decision will mean that we risk losing high calibre staff, by focusing on other studios with exciting new projects in development... we believe we will be in a stronger position going forward and able to offer the best possible content of the highest quality to our players. ""This decision should not take anything away from the incredible games and services that Guerrilla Cambridge has delivered."" The move follows the closure of Sony's Cheshire-based Evolution Studio - best known for its Driveclub game - last March, and Studio Liverpool - which made the Wipeout series - in 2012. However, Sony did open a development base in Manchester in 2015, and continues to operate studios in London and Guildford. ""It is a shock, because the Cambridge studio had been in existence for so long,"" said Piers Harding-Rolls, a video games industry analyst at IHS Technology. ""But the games sector as a whole is growing, and it's not unusual for the big companies to realign their resources."" Microsoft also closed a long-established British studio - Lionhead, the developer of the Fable series - in 2016. But the games industry trade association Tiga said that a tax relief scheme, which came into effect in 2014, had helped create jobs elsewhere. ""It's very sad to hear what is happening to Sony Guerrilla Cambridge, but the actual size of the UK games industry is almost at an all time high and we are in a very strong position,"" said Richard Wilson, the body's chief executive. 'Fast and fluid' Guerrilla Cambridge's last game - Rigs: Mechanized Combat League - was launched three months ago as a launch title for the PlayStation's virtual reality headset. It was generally well reviewed. The Gaming Age described it as ""the very best VR experience that this system has to offer"". Sixth Axis said: ""So long as you're not affected too heavily by motion sickness... you'll find a fast and fluid multiplayer shooter that gets the best out of PSVR."" However, the title was not a bestseller. ""Guerrilla Cambridge's games have been for the [handheld] PlayStation Vita and most recently PlayStation VR, which have low install bases,"" said Chris Dring, from the GamesIndustry.biz news site ""So, even though its games have been critically well received, commercially they have struggled. ""That may not have been that important to Sony - obviously it wants to make money from its titles, but platform-holders also use their own games to help sell the hardware in the first place and to help show the way for other studios. ""The move suggests that there's a broader strategy at play, where perhaps Sony is slowing down slightly on its internal VR development to give more opportunity to third-party studios."" Sony said that its Guerrilla Games studio in Amsterdam would not be affected by the cuts.","Sony is closing its Cambridge-based video games studio, Guerrilla Cambridge."
"Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent@BBCRoryCJon Twitter And - rather like the transport system where the anticipated chaos has (so far) failed to materialise - it looks as though the networks came through Friday night very well. Since then, however, some technology problems have surfaced. On the Olympic Park, the investment in extra capacity in the form of 30 masts and one of the world's best wi-fi networks, has paid off. The 80,000 spectators and volunteers pumped out photos, tweets, texts and calls without problems. Vodafone says its network saw data usage from the stadium equivalent to the sending of 400,000 smartphone pictures. Across the country, predictions that it would be a busy but not exceptional night for mobile networks proved accurate. Vodafone says that while data volume was up by 5% on the previous week, the volume of calls and texts was about the same. With 27 million watching the opening ceremony on television, it seems that many were using their home broadband rather than their mobiles to connect. But it was a different story on Saturday, when a million people took to the streets of south-west London and Surrey to follow the men's cycling road race. It seems they were making constant use of their phones to update Facebook and Twitter and to send photos - and that is being blamed for the fact that vital race data, apparently travelling over the same mobile networks, was slow to reach the commentators. Privately, the networks say they were never asked by the games organisers to provide an ""Olympic lane"" for race data traffic, so they cannot be blamed for any problems. Last night saw a technical problem of a more embarrassing nature for one of the Olympic sponsors. Visa is using the Games to try out some new technology, principally a mobile payments system on a Samsung Galaxy smartphone, and at one stage there were ambitions to make this the first cashless Olympics. But at Wembley, where the Great Britain football team was playing the UAE, the whole Visa system appeared to collapse - and spectators found that good old fashioned cash was the only way to pay for their purchases. Visa says it was Wembley's systems, not theirs, that failed: ""The cash-only decision was made by Wembley management and not Visa."" Still, it is another sign that the road to a cashless economy is going to be strewn with potholes. But the prize for the single most embarrassing Olympics technical failure so far must go to the American television network NBC. For anyone of an even slightly geeky bent, one of the highlights of the opening ceremony was the appearance of Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web. ""This is for everyone,"" was the message he sent via Twitter to the world from the stadium. ""Who he?"" was the reaction of the NBC commentators. They went on to suggest that viewers should Google Berners-Lee to find out more. An operation which, as many people swiftly pointed out, would have been impossible if a great British scientist had not come up with an idea he called the web more than 20 years ago.","On Friday, I wrote about the challenge facing the mobile phone networks as the Olympics got underway, and a huge volume of texts tweets and other traffic threatened to clog them up."
"The contract is only for ticket offices, escalators and platforms because it would have required major construction work to have added connectivity to the network's tunnels. From July 2012 all Tube passengers will initially be able to connect to the internet for free. After the Olympic and Paralympic Games it will be a pay-as-you-go service. Virgin Media's mobile and broadband customers will be offered continued access as part of their subscriptions. Other non-paying users will be limited to a site showing online travel information. The firm said it intended to introduce wi-fi to 80 stations by the summer, and by up to 120 stations by the end of the year. The company's chief executive, Neil Berkett, said: ""We'll help people make the most of the city and will continue to evolve the service, ensuring everyone can benefit from a service London will be proud of."" Transport for London (TfL) estimates that four million people use the Tube every day. Deep-level deal London Underground staff will be responsible for fitting the equipment, but the organisation stressed that the cost would be covered by the commercial contract. ""This latest innovation is great news for Tube customers, who now have access to emails, web and social media underground for the first time,"" said Gareth Powell, London Underground's director of strategy and service development. ""It's also delivered at no cost to fare payers and taxpayers."" Wi-fi is already available on many of the UK's overground trains. GNER was the first operator to offer the service on the East Coast Main Line in 2004. However, TfL said this would be the UK's first ""deep-level"" network to provide wireless internet to the public. Glasgow's Subway has had mobile phone and wi-fi services available on its 15 platforms since 2008, but the service is not as deep underground as London's. Some overseas networks - such as the Dubai Metro, which contains several underground stations - are able to offer continued access to customers during journeys. The Chinese telecoms equipment firm Huawei had originally explored an option to install 3G phone and data services throughout the Tube, but TfL opted not to implement its scheme. It was discovered that the cost of adding antennas to the antiquated system would have been prohibitive because the lack of space between the trains and the tunnels would have made building work necessary. Virgin Media said it believed that the Tube's limited wi-fi access would not put customers at a huge disadvantage. ""Every wi-fi station you pass through is going to give you the chance to stay connected, by quickly updating Facebook, Twitter, email and the like,"" Kevin Baughan, Virgin Media's director of wireless told the BBC. ""Even while travelling people will have a great experience.""",Virgin Media has won the contract to provide wi-fi to the London Underground.

And consumer groups in France, Denmark, Germany, Greece and Switzerland are also calling for action. The study from the NCC said that on each of the six pages in the cancellation process, the consumer ""is nudged towards keeping their Prime membership"". The pages include yellow warning triangles with an exclamation point inside and buttons containing the text ""keep my benefits"". This, it said, is an example of ""dark patterns"" - which it defines as techniques or features of design that are meant to manipulate users. The watchdog also spoke to 1,000 Norwegian consumers about their experiences and found that one in four recalled having difficulties unsubscribing from digital content services. 'Cancellation flow' Amazon Prime is a digital subscription service with more than 150 million members globally. It offers free and fast shipping of Amazon products, as well as access to other services such as Prime Video films and TV shows. In the UK, it costs £79 a year or £7.99 a month. In a statement, Amazon said it ""makes it clear and easy for Prime members to cancel their subscription at any time, whether through a few clicks online, a quick phone call or by turning off auto renew in their membership options"". It added: ""Customer trust is at the heart of all of our products and services and we reject the claim that our cancellation process is unfair or creates uncertainty. ""The information we provide in the online cancellation flow gives a full view of the benefits and services members are cancelling."" In 2019, the UK's Advertising Standards Authority ruled that one of Amazon's page layouts was misleading and meant people could easily have signed up for Prime unintentionally. The NCC's director of digital policy, Finn Lutzow-Holm Myrstad, said: ""It should be as easy to end a subscription as it was to subscribe in the first place. ""Amazon should facilitate a good user experience instead of hindering customers and tricking them into continuing paid service they do not need or want."" Previously the watchdog has investigated Google and Facebook over their use of ""dark patterns"" in the design of their privacy polices. It found that the documents often hid privacy-friendly options or forced users to take longer to sign up to them, with some settings obscured and pop-ups omitting key information.

"Mark Karpeles was chief executive of MtGox when it collapsed in 2014, following the loss of 850,000 bitcoins, then worth nearly $0.4bn (£0.3bn). In its bankruptcy filing, MtGox blamed the loss on hackers. It later said it had found 200,000 bitcoins in old digital wallets. The prosecution claims that Mr Karpeles transferred 341 million yen ($3 million) from a MtGox account into an account registered in his own name during the last quarter of 2013. Mr Karpeles' lawyers deny that this was embezzlement. ""I swear to God that I am innocent,"" he is reported to have told the court. Today, one bitcoin is worth £1,800, or $2,300, but the digital currency is notoriously volatile. How Bitcoin works To process bitcoin transactions, a procedure called ""mining"" must take place, which involves a computer solving a difficult mathematical problem with a 64-digit solution. For each problem solved, one block of bitcoins is processed. In addition, the miner is rewarded with new bitcoins. This provides an incentive for people to provide computer processing power to solve the problems. To compensate for the growing power of computer chips, the difficulty of the puzzles is adjusted to ensure a steady stream of new bitcoins are produced each day. There are currently about 15 million bitcoins in existence. To receive a bitcoin, a user must have a Bitcoin address - a string of 27-34 letters and numbers - which acts as a kind of virtual post-box to and from which the bitcoins are sent. Since there is no register of these addresses, people can use them to protect their anonymity when making a transaction. These addresses are in turn stored in Bitcoin wallets, which are used to manage savings. They operate like privately run bank accounts - with the proviso that if the data is lost, so are the bitcoins owned.","The former head of MtGox, once the world's biggest Bitcoin exchange, has pleaded not guilty in a Tokyo court to charges of embezzlement and data manipulation."
"By Leo KelionTechnology reporter At present several non-profit US bodies oversee the net's technical specifications and domain name system. They operate at arms-length from the US government but officially under the remit of its Department of Commerce. There has been speculation that other nations will push for a change later this year, but they cannot force the US to comply. The US has set out its position in documents filed with the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) - the UN agency responsible for encouraging the development of communications technologies. The ITU is hosting a conference in December in Dubai to which representatives from 178 nations have been invited to review the International Telecommunications Regulations (ITR). The ITR is a 1988 treaty which set out rules for how traffic should flow between different telecom networks, and how to calculate charges for traffic exchanged between carriers in different countries. The rise of the internet and mobile devices has led to calls for it to be revised, but countries are expected to disagree over the changes needed. The US's ambassador to the conference, Terry Kramer, outlined his worries in a statement published by the country's Department of State. ""The US is concerned that proposals by some other governments could lead to greater regulatory burdens being placed on the international telecom sector, or perhaps even extended to the internet sector,"" he wrote. ""The United States also believes that existing multi-stakeholder institutions, incorporating industry and civil society, have functioned effectively and will continue to ensure the health and growth of the internet and all its benefits."" Leaked documents The ITU does not publish submissions by each country - leaving it up to the individual states to decide which material to release. But a site called Wcitleaks.org has posted proposals leaked to it. They include a submission from Russia suggesting the ITU could become responsible for allocating at least some of the internet's addresses as well as the ""determination of the necessary requirements"". At present US-based Icann (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) co-ordinates the codes and numbering systems, deciding which new internet address endings should be allowed as an alternative to .com. It then leaves it to ISPs (internet service providers) to assign individual addresses. President Vladimir Putin has signalled Russia's final submission could go further. In 2011 he said he was keen to discuss ""establishing international control over the internet using the monitoring and supervisory capabilities of the International Telecommunication Union"". The Russia Today news service has since reported that China and India had backed this stance. No votes But the ITU has made it clear that any changes to the treaty must have unanimous support, and it would block members trying to put any matter to a vote. ""We never vote because voting means winners and losers and you can't afford that,"" Dr Hamadoun Toure, the ITU's secretary-general told the BBC. ""Whatever one single country does not accept will not pass."" He acknowledged that some countries were unhappy with the way Icann had looked after the internet address system. ""Some people are saying the governments are not consulted enough,"" he said. But he played down the idea that there would be a serious effort to seize control of its functions and pass them to the ITU. ""Has anybody suggested to take responsibility from Icann? No, it's never been done. I truly believe there is a complementarity involved between our work - we can work together.""",The US has confirmed it would resist efforts to put the internet under the control of the United Nations.
"By Chris Foxx & Leo KelionTechnology reporters The US firm said it was teaming up with London-based Wenn Media Group to carry out the initial coin offering (ICO). It is part of a blockchain-based initiative to help photographers control their image rights. Kodak also detailed plans to install rows of Bitcoin mining rigs at its headquarters in Rochester, New York. Details of this second scheme - which is being branded the Kodak KashMiner - were outlined at the CES tech show in Las Vegas. Customers will pay up-front to rent mining capacity. Kodak is the latest in a series of companies to see its value jump after revealing plans for blockchain-related activity. ""This is a phenomenon we saw back during the dot com days in the late 1990s where traditional companies would mention some kind of internet strategy and their stock price would jump up,"" commented Garrick Hileman from the University of Cambridge. ""When you see stock prices moving like this it does appear to be troubling - it's hard to say if there's a bubble but it certainly is indicative of a frothy investment market."" Coin creation Kodak developed a digital camera in 1975, but decided not to commercialise the technology at the time, and its hesitation to leave behind its film heritage is thought by some to have contributed to it filing for bankruptcy protection years later in 2012. Since that collapse, Kodak has licensed its brand to a variety of manufacturers, with the mark appearing on batteries, printers, drones, tablet computers and digital cameras. The KashMiner operation will be run by Spotlite, a licensee that had previously teamed up with Kodak to use its brand to market LED lights. More from CES: Mining involves carrying out processor-intensive tasks to solve complicated mathematical problems in order to verify crypto-currency transactions. Any Bitcoins generated by Kodak KashMiner will be shared between the customer and the business. Each of the mining rig boxes - which include computer processors and fans to keep them cool - will use about the same amount of electricity as running a hairdryer around the clock. But the scheme will be able to take advantage of Kodak's on-site power generating plant, which has had spare capacity since Kodak's heyday. The company says it can power each rig for four cents per kilowatt hour, which is significantly cheaper than running a rig at home. At Bitcoin's current value, an up-front investment of $4,000 (£2,954) for 24 months of mining could earn a profit of $500 a month, Spotlite's Halston Mikail told the BBC. But anybody hoping to join the gamble would have to wait, as capacity is already sold out, Mr Mikail added. ""At this time we have 80 miners, and we expect another 300 to arrive shortly. There is a big pile-up of demand,"" he said. Bitcoin is notoriously volatile and some analysts fear its value could crash, resulting in a loss for those who had paid up-front for mining capacity. But Mr Mikail said the rigs could be put to work on other tasks if Bitcoin faltered. ""Bitcoin could be a bubble. But the blockchain industry is not a bubble,"" he said. ""It's a solid platform built on mathematics and it will survive."" Kodak currency Kodak's other initiative, the KodakCoin, is being created as part of an effort to build a global ledger of picture rights ownership that photographers can add their work to. Associated KodakOne software will be used to crawl the web and find pictures that have been used without permission. The company said it would then ""manage the licensing process,"" so the photographer can be paid, in KodakCoin. ""Kodak has always sought to democratise photography and make licensing fair to artists,"" said Kodak chief executive Jeff Clarke. ""These technologies give the photography community an innovative and easy way to do just that."" The company's shares traded more than 130% above their opening price after the announcement before closing the day 119.4% higher. But one expert had doubts. ""Storing the information in a blockchain doesn't protect your copyright any more than copyright law already does,"" commented David Gerard, author of Attack of the 50ft Blockchain. ""Notice how they're marketing it: they state a problem, then say the blockchain can solve it. But there's no mechanism by which the blockchain could do that. ""This doesn't do anything that signing up for Shutterstock or Getty Images wouldn't."" Even so, some think Kodak will not be the last household name to associate itself with an ICO. ""I expect we are going to see more major brands releasing their own tokens and currencies to support various products and services,"" commented Mr Hileman. ""It's something many big companies are thinking very hard about.""

"By Zoe KleinmanTechnology reporter, BBC News Did you upload photos, open an email attachment or watch a video clip? That same five minutes can vary wildly in terms of how much data you use depending on how you actually passed the time. Most fixed mobile phone contracts include a monthly package of free minutes and data use. Once that limit has been reached, the bill can soon rocket, with some providers charging 35p per minute for calls and £5 per megabyte (MB) of data. Website billmonitor.com has analysed over two million UK phone bills and founder Dr Stelios Koundouros said the fear of accruing these extra costs is driving many people to take out contracts which are far bigger - and more expensive - than they actually need. ""People are really afraid to go over their allowance so they pick a contract they feel covers them no matter what,"" he told the BBC. ""Mobile price plans become significantly expensive if you exceed your allowance - people try to avoid that but end up overshooting and that means wasting significant money on line rental."" Bill shock Dr Koundouros claims that 74% of people who have had their bills analysed by his service since its launch in 2009 found they were paying too much. He says that so-called ""bill shock"" - the unpleasant surprise of a very large phone bill - is far less common than people cautiously over-paying for phone allowances they do not use, and that confusion about data use is a prime reason for this. ""It's pretty hard to know what you're using,"" he said. ""That's the number one piece of feedback."" In a report released last year billmonitor found that half of the smartphone users on its database were using less than 154MB per month but 88% had at least 500MB for free in their call plan. They also had 600 free minutes, but were only using around 150-200 minutes. ""People make a really basic guess and then their usage can change over time,"" said Dr Koundouros. ""Data use is on the increase. We've observed that the longer you have a smartphone the more data you consume. Over the last 12 months average data usage has increased from 200MB to 280MB."" Itemised data Eldar Tuvey is CEO of Wandera and Snappli, two companies which offer data compression services to individuals and corporate smartphone users. He compares it with ""flat packing a kitchen"" and says while there is sometimes a compromise on quality, especially when streaming data intensive high definition video, it is more efficient and economical. ""Data is now 43% of the total bill,"" he said. ""Some people expect it to be 70% in a couple of years' time. Others think it will go to 100% as voice moves over to data through apps like Facetime, text moves to data through Whatsapp and other messaging apps. Soon your whole bill will be data."" Mr Tuvey thinks the solution lies in itemised data bills. ""In terms of voice - we've had itemised billing for ages,"" he said. ""But when you go to YouTube or Facebook it doesn't say, 'this will cost you 23p for five minutes'. Part of our service is to give visibility to that data so employers can see which apps are being used, which websites are being used, how much that costs on an itemised basis."" Video is ""the number one hogger"" of data according to Wandera and Snapply's figures. ""After that it's social networks, then it's a bunch of news apps and sites, email is only 12%,"" said Mr Tuvey. ""One employee was a lawyer in Dubai and wanted to watch the Grand Prix. He watched the Formula 1 for two hours and came back with a bill - I think it was £14,000. We are trying to eliminate that sort of shock."" Set alerts John McCann, phone and tablets expert at tech news and reviews website techradar.com, has some straight forward tips for keeping data use down. ""Protection in the phone's operating system itself is really useful,"" he said. Android phone users operating the latest version of the platform, Ice Cream Sandwich, can set both monthly data limits and alerts in the ""settings"" section of the device. When the handset nears the limit set by the user a message appears on screen, and if the limit is reached the data function disables itself for the rest of the 30 day period. ""Networks also offer their own apps to show you how many minute and texts you send and more importantly how much data you have used."" Mr McCann advised using public wifi wherever possible and played down security fears about such networks. ""A lot of wifi networks have log-in pages which require a certain amount of personal information but if it's run by someone like BT Openzone or The Cloud, they are reputable companies and not likely to do something reckless with your data."" He also suggested taking out a 30-day rolling contract which is easier to tweak as usage becomes more habitual. A spokesperson from O2 told the BBC it offers a number of ways for customers to track their data usage. ""Our advisers will ask a series of questions to determine how a customer will use their phone. Based on the answers, they'll recommend a tariff that's best suited to their needs,"" he said. ""We're always happy to talk to customers who want to discuss their monthly allowance usage. They can also keep track online or through the My O2 app which can help monitor usage and control spend."" Everything Everywhere (EE) also said it offers an app and phoneline service for customers who wish to check how they are using their call plans. ""The rise of the smartphone means that data allowances are just as important as the call minutes and texts included in a plan,"" a spokesperson said. ""EE's plans offer unlimited calls and texts and a choice of data allowances.""","We all understand the price of a five-minute phone call. But five minutes spent on a social network, or checking an email account, is a lot more difficult to attach a value to."
"They indicate that several of the US company's Geek Squad staff were paid for reporting child abuse imagery. The rights group Electronic Frontier Foundation said that the relationship ""circumvents computer owners' Fourth Amendment rights"" to privacy. The FBI did not respond to questions about its relationship with other repair companies, according to the EFF. The EFF began a Freedom of Information Act legal action to obtain the documents last year, after a doctor was prosecuted for child abuse imagery when Geek Squad technician reported an image of a naked child on his computer to FBI agents. It was previously reported that the technician had been paid $500 (£360) by the FBI. The charges were dropped in November 2017 when a federal judge ruled that the image flagged by the Geek Squad technician was not sufficient evidence for the FBI to request a search warrant. The judge also ruled that the photograph did not qualify as child abuse imagery. The new documents indicate that the US consumer electronics giant hosted a meeting of the FBI's Cyber Working Group in a computer repair facility as early as 2008. During the visit, agents were also reportedly given a tour of the building. The documents also suggest that Geek Squad technicians report only material they happen to find while doing repairs, rather than actively searching for illegal content on customers' devices. Best Buy said in a statement that it prohibited employees ""from doing anything other than what is necessary to solve the customer's problem"". ""In the wake of these allegations, we have redoubled our efforts to train employees on what to do - and not do - in these circumstances."" ""Our employees do not search for this material; they inadvertently discover it when attempting to confirm we have recovered lost customer data.""","Best Buy's computer repair workers have been aiding the FBI for at least 10 years, new documents suggest."
"By Dan SimmonsClick presenter The bugs were found in alarm apps by Clifford, Viper, and Pandora. The alarms are on three million vehicles. The security researchers exploited the bugs to activate car alarms, unlock a vehicle's doors and start the engine via an insecure app. The expose has prompted the firms to upgrade security to remove the flaws. Alarms 'unhackable' The research was carried out for the BBC's Click technology programme by security consultants Pen Test Partners, which has a long track record of uncovering software flaws. The firm focussed on two well-known firms that produce alarms that can be accessed and controlled via smartphone apps - Pandora and Clifford (known in the US as Viper). The research found that Pandora, which had advertised its system as ""unhackable"", allowed a user to reset account passwords for any account. Pandora now no longer makes the claim that its system is unhackable. The password flaw allowed researchers significant access to the app. They could: The ethical hackers also looked at smart alarms produced by Clifford, which is the market leader in third-party alarms in the UK. The team found that it was possible to use a legitimate account to access other users' profiles and to then change the passwords for those accounts and take control. ""I could look on the system and look for a nice Lamborghini or a Porsche, locate one close to where I am, go and start that car if no one's around, open the doors and drive away"" said Chris Pritchard, a security consultant at Pen Test Partners. Account compromised Directed, the parent company for the Viper and Clifford brands, admitted that ""customers' accounts could have been accessed without authorisation... as a result of a recent update"". It added that the company did not believe any data had been accessed without authorisation. The security flaw has now been fixed. ""Directed is committed to providing safe and secure products but no system can be 100% safe,"" it told Click. In a statement, Russia-based Pandora Alarms, which also sells products in the UK, said: ""We have made changes to the code and upgraded security. The pain point has been removed."" It advised that the key fob provided to owners with the alarms ""would override any remote access through the app"". Tech mistakes Security expert Professor Alan Woodward from the University of Surrey's Centre for Cyber-Security said it was ""disappointing"" to see relatively simple flaws introduced by companies in the business of security. ""You would have thought any company claiming security as their core business would have done a thorough penetration test on the system as a whole,"" he said. ""It's hard not to conclude that it was not done here."" He added: ""The problems were within the direct control of the company. I fear that security researchers are yet again the only ones holding these manufacturers to account."" Prof Woodward said it had become a trend for companies to spend a great deal of time on the ""front end"" of the apps that users see, but pay less attention to the ""back end"" which leaves the programmes open to security flaws. ""It should be the companies paying for this, not researchers doing it as a sideline,"" he said. BBC Click's full investigation into the vulnerabilities of car alarms is on BBC News Channel, iPlayer and BBC World News this Saturday and Sunday.","Security flaws in three specialist car alarms have left vehicles vulnerable to being stolen or hijacked, say researchers."
"The all-in-one gadget does not need to be connected to a computer or use a phone's screen to show images. The move comes a month after Facebook's Oculus division unveiled plans for its own untethered headset. HTC has not given any pricing or release dates for the Focus but did say it would initially be available in only China. At the same time, HTC announced it had stopped working with Google to produce a standalone headset based on the search giant's Daydream technology. Lenovo is still working with Google on a headset. Scene setting The Vive Focus has an AMOLED screen and uses internal sensors to work out where a person is looking. It gives users a greater ability to explore virtual scenes, as it will support six degrees of movement. Current all-in-one headsets that use a smartphone's screen as a display typically have only four degrees of freedom - up, down, left and right. With six, users can move their heads backwards and forwards and get a greater sense of their presence in a virtual scene. ""Six degrees of freedom tracking is a standard feature on high-end PC and console headsets, and, with its support, instantly elevates Focus above cheaper smartphone VR headset solutions,"" said games analyst Piers Harding-Rolls, from IHS Markit. Mr Harding-Rolls said standalone headsets were the ""end game"" for wearable VR and it was ""encouraging"" to see HTC release one that could match PC versions. He said HTC's the decision to release the Focus in only China made sense. ""China is the most advanced market for smartphone VR and for trying out higher quality VR at out-of-home venues,"" he said. Headsets from Facebook, Google and Samsung were not officially available in China, he said, which could leave a vacuum for HTC to occupy. HTC will face competition from Oculus, which is working on two untethered headsets. The first, called the Oculus Go, matches the capabilities of smartphone-based headsets. The other, called Santa Cruz, is an untethered version of its current, powerful Rift headset.",HTC has officially unveiled a standalone virtual reality headset called the Vive Focus.
"The four-minute video shows the collision of three cars, with viewers able to see it from 360 degrees. Some road safety charities said it helped to show the dangers of drink driving, but others said it could have been more powerful. Unlike some VR apps which put people in charge of the simulated experience, the viewer is not driving the car. The video follows three cars: one with a woman celebrating a career breakthrough; another with two new parents; and the third a group of friends on their way to a party. It builds up to the crash, which comes after the woman, who has been drinking with work colleagues, tries to overtake one of the other cars. Diageo, whose brands include Smirnoff and Guinness, released the video through Facebook 360, YouTube 360 and a VR app integration with The New York Times. It is also compatible with VR headsets, including Samsung Gear VR, Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, Google Daydream and Google Cardboard. To feel the full impact of the crash, Diageo will provide a D-Box chair at some events which shakes as the cars collide and spin out of control. The initiative has launched in the US and is targeted at those old enough to drink alcohol. The Campaign against Drinking and Driving (Cadd), an independent UK charity, said the use of VR would help to show the risks. ""Anything that makes people stop and think has got to be a good thing,"" Carole Whittingham of Cadd told the BBC. But she added it ""could have gone further"" on the message that people are killed by drinking and driving, as the main character survives the crash. She also thought the US-produced video might be less relatable for British audiences. Drink Driver Education Plus, which provides advice and training to deal with drug and drink diving, was critical of the use of ""scare tactics"" in the video. Dr Lucia Valmaggia, head of the Virtual Reality Lab at King's College London, said: ""VR has been shown to trigger a response which is similar to a real life experience."" She said it would be for a drink-drive expert to comment on the video's effectiveness, but that it was ""quite immersive when watched in 3D"". Dr Ashley Conway, a psychologist who treats phobias with VR, said watching the Diageo video through a VR headset would be more ""visceral and absorbing"" than a 2D clip. ""It gives you more than a flat image or an Imax cinema with 3D glasses. With a VR headset your heart will beat faster, you will sweat, you will feel fear much more,"" he said. 'Zero-tolerance' Diageo first announced in June that it would create the VR campaign, shortly after signing a two-year partnership with the United Nations Institute for Training and Research (Unitar) to raise awareness of drink driving. The campaign will help to spread the ""message that drink driving is completely unacceptable"", said Jack Kushner, a spokesman for Brake, a UK road safety charity which includes Diageo as a corporate sponsor. ""Even drinking a small amount of alcohol can have significant, adverse effects on reactions and judgement, which is why we call for a zero tolerance drink drive limit,"" he added. Brake was not involved in this initiative.",A virtual reality video simulating a drink driving car crash has been released by alcohol maker Diageo.
"Judge David Harvey described the US as the ""enemy"" while discussing copyright law, at a conference last week. It attracted attention because he had been dealing with the US government's request that New Zealand hand over employees of the file-sharing site to face copyright and fraud charges. The accused deny the allegations. DVD row Judge Harvey made the comment at the NetHui internet conference in Auckland on 12 July. He had been taking part in a discussion about the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) treaty - a proposed intellectual rights agreement involving the US and about a dozen other countries. The judge had noted that at present it was legal for citizens in New Zealand to hack DVD region codes to watch disks designed to be restricted to other countries, adding that TPP would change this. ""Under TPP and the American Digital Millennium copyright provisions you will not be able to do that, that will be prohibited,"" he said. ""If you do you will be a criminal, that's what will happen. ""There are all sorts of ways this whole thing is being ramped up and if I could use Russell's tweet from earlier on - we have met the enemy and he is US."" The reference was a play on words adapting the quote ""we have met the enemy and he is us"". News spreads The news was reported by The National Business Review the same day, but only attracted controversy three days later when the New Zealand Herald published a report quoting local law professor Bill Hodge who said the comment could ""be seen as probably an extra-judicial comment that isn't helpful"". The news was then picked up by other media including several US-based tech blogs. The judge has ruled several times in Megaupload founder Kim Dotcom's favour, including restoring his internet access and ordering the US to hand over evidence gathered against the accused. Judge Harvey's most recent involvement with the case was a week ago, when he delayed the extradition hearing from August until March next year to allow more time to resolve legal arguments. A statement given by the chief district court judge of New Zealand, Jan-Marie Doogue, explained Judge Harvey's decision to remove himself from the case. ""He recognises that remarks made in the context of a paper he delivered on copyright law at a recent internet conference could reflect on his impartiality and that the appropriate response is for him to step down from the case,"" she said.",The judge overseeing the Megaupload extradition case has stepped down after one of his comments caused his impartiality to be questioned.
"By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor An opinion issued by the European Court of Justice says that current data-sharing rules between the 28-nation bloc and the US are ""invalid"". The decision could affect other tech firms' abilities to send Europeans' information to US data centres. However, it is not a final judgement. Although the EU's highest court tends to follow the opinions of its legal adviser, the 15 judges involved have yet to issue a conclusive ruling of their own on the matter. Even so, Max Schrems - the activist who prompted the case - suggests there could be far-reaching consequences. ""Companies that participate in US mass surveillance and provide, for example, cloud services within the EU and rely on data centres in the US may now have to invest in secure data centres within the European Union,"" he said. ""This could be a major issue for Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft or Yahoo. ""All of them operate data centres in Europe, but may need to fundamentally restructure their data storage architecture and maybe even their corporate structure."" A spokeswoman for the social network said: ""Facebook operates in compliance with EU Data Protection law. Like the thousands of other companies who operate data transfers across the Atlantic we await the full judgement."" Safe harbour The origins of Mr Schrems' dispute with Facebook can be traced back to whistleblower Edward Snowden's leaks about US cyberspies' activities. In 2013, Snowden released details about a surveillance scheme operated by the NSA called Prism, which provided officials with ways to scrutinise data held by US tech firms about Europeans and other foreign citizens. Mr Schrems alleged that, in light of the revelations, EU citizens had no protection against US surveillance efforts once their data had been transferred. He targeted Facebook in particular because of the wide range of data it gathered and the number of people using it. However, when he took the case to Ireland - where Facebook's European headquarters are based - it was initially rejected. The Irish data watchdog said the Safe Harbour agreement between the US and EU prevented it from intervening. When Mr Schrems challenged the watchdog in the Irish courts, the matter was referred to the European Court of Justice. What is Safe Harbour? The EU forbids the transfer of personal data to other parts of the world that do not provide ""adequate"" privacy protections. But to make it easier for the US tech giants to function, it allows them to self-certify that they are carrying out the required steps, allowing the firms to avoid further checks. More than 4,000 US companies make use of the Safe Harbour principle to facilitate data transfers. Mr Schrems claims this gives them an unfair advantage over other firms that must ""stick to much stricter"" privacy rules. Privacy opinion The ECJ is expected to rule in the matter later this year. The opinion, from one of its advocates general, is likely to influence that decision. Yves Bot wrote that the Safe Harbour scheme did not contain ""appropriate guarantees for preventing mass and generalised access"" to EU citizens' data once it had been sent to the US. As a result, if there was evidence of ""systemic deficiencies"" in the way the US was treating that data, he added, then ""member states must be able to take the measures necessary to safeguard the fundamental rights protected by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU, which include the right to respect for private and family life and the right to the protection of personal data"". Mr Bot concluded that data privacy watchdogs could indeed suspend data transfers to the US, despite the existence of Safe Harbour. ""This finding, if confirmed by the court, would be a major step in limiting the legal options for US authorities to conduct mass surveillance on data held by EU companies, including EU subsidiaries of US companies,"" commented Mr Schrems. Facebook publishes a limited amount of information about data handovers to the US authorities, but denies suggestions it freely shares access. ""We have repeatedly said that we do not provide 'backdoor' access to Facebook servers and data to intelligence agencies or governments,"" said a spokeswoman for Facebook. ""As Mark [Zuckerberg] said in June 2013, we had never heard of Prism before it was reported by the press and we have never participated in any such scheme."" 'Disrupted' data The Safe Harbour framework itself is currently being renegotiated by the EU and US. But industry lobby group TechUK has voiced concern that the ECJ's eventual ruling could cause ""disruption"". ""The approach that Europe takes to how data flows in and out of the EU will impact the global ambitions of data-driven companies in the UK and right across Europe,"" commented Antony Walker, the body's deputy chief executive. ""Thousands of companies, employing tens of thousands of people in the UK alone, rely upon Safe Harbour every day.""",A privacy campaigner has scored a legal victory that could bolster his attempts to prevent Facebook from being able to pass EU citizens' data to the US authorities.
"By Carolyn RiceTechnology reporter, BBC News The exercise books, the textbooks and the stationery can also be packed away. There is no need for any of them in the classroom of the future. A room full of students with a tablet each and a teacher with an enthusiasm for social media is all that is required to engage developing minds. At least in one school in Norway this isn't a vision of the future. This is now. Ann Michaelsen, a teacher at Sandvika High School just outside Oslo, has been invited to Bett - the education world's biggest tech fair, held in London - to share her ideas with other technologically minded teachers. ""Social media is first and foremost a place to get connected - we do it every single day outside school or work, sometimes in work,"" she says. ""Most people would encourage connections - school seems to be the last place where that is allowed. It's almost restricted."" 'Digitally rich' Every student in Ms Michaelsen's English class is taught how to set up their own blog. This becomes where they display their work, which others can comment on, and the teacher can mark online. ""I don't use textbooks at all because I think that limits how you teach. I post something on the front of my blog and tell my students: 'This is what we're going to do today', "" she says. The aim of this method, she adds, is to create a ""digitally rich"" environment where pupils drive learning and classrooms are constantly online, allowing students to be creative by making their own discoveries rather than being led by a teacher. ""You can't grade being inventive,"" she adds. The class also uses Quadblogging - software that allows four schools to join up online and interact and comment on each other's blogs. ""It's been really exciting because we can read, comment and exchange information with students in other countries,"" says Haakon Bakker, a 17-year-old student at Sandvika. Innovative thoughts Updates and instructions are given via a group Facebook page. Being a member of a group means Ms Michaelsen doesn't need to address the tricky issue of friend requests from students as people can interact on the page without needing to be Facebook friends first. Twitter is used to gain inspiration from classes and teachers around the world. ""If you're an English teacher and you're not using Twitter then you're missing out,"" she explains. ""Teachers are sharing interesting, innovative thoughts. There are people from the US, South Africa and New Zealand on my feed, I can ask people around the world for help."" The class also makes use of Skype and has link-ups with schools in Lesotho, China and North America. ""We use it to ask them about cultural differences and how different their lives are,"" explains Haakon. Sandvika operates a one-to-one policy where every student is provided with a tablet and wi-fi operates throughout the school. For Jim Watson, a UK teacher attending Bett from Burntwood School in Wandsworth, the availability of resources like those at Sandvika is a long way off. The school already uses a system called Word Wall, which allows his students to use a handheld wireless keyboard to take part in an activity on a large interactive screen at the front of the classroom. A new version of the software that uses tablets is being rolled out but currently Burntwood does not have tablets. It is looking at developing a bring-your-own-device to school programme as a work-around. For UK classrooms to be on a par with those at Sandvika, he thinks the attitude of teachers towards social media needs to be addressed. ""Everyone is scared,"" he says. ""For 15 years teachers have been saying 'put your phone away' in class - now it's 'get them out'."" Mr Watson trialled his own social media method by taking part in an ""exam clinic"" on Twitter: a last minute question-and-answer session with his students the night before one of their A-Level exams. He says that the response was positive and he would like to do more. Age gap Janet Crompton teaches much younger children at Leckhampton School in Cheltenham and acknowledges that even at primary school-level technological advancements can be daunting for teachers. ""Individual teachers don't need to be totally up to date but they do need to be open and willing to new ideas,"" she adds. It is a sentiment that Ann Michaelsen agrees with, particularly in regard to the increasing presence of social media in her students' lives. ""If teachers don't know how to do this sort of thing then nothing will change. If students don't know how to do this then they'll be as conservative as the teachers about it,"" she says. Student Hanne Wiger is keen to let others know what this way of learning means to her. ""I think it makes life easier, if you're not in class then you can just go online. You're not missing out,"" she says. Could Haakon and Hanne imagine a school life without social media now? They both laugh. ""No, just simply no.""","Forget the blackboard and the chalk. In fact, forget the whiteboard and the markers."
"The mock hospital has been built on a giant ""shake table"" which can subject the building to movements similar to real earthquakes. The tests are designed to determine if hospitals built on rubber bearings could function after a quake. The use of these rubber bearings is common in earthquake-prone Japan. The $5m (£3.1m) project also tested whether the bearings could protect other strategically important buildings, such as computer data centres, so they could operate without interruption after a large earthquake. It is the first time that the bearing system has been tested under a full-scale building on a shake table in the United States. ""What the bearings do is uncouple the building from the motion of the ground during an earthquake, like putting the building on roller skates,"" said Tara Hutchinson, an engineering professor at the University of California, San Diego. She said that while most research concentrated on the structural integrity of buildings after an earthquake, very little examined how vital contents such as stairs, lifts and other parts of a building that allowed it to fulfil its function fared after a major seismic event. Earthquakes replayed The building was equipped with a surgery and an intensive-care unit, computer servers and other electrical equipment, as well as stairs and a working lift. The 80ft (24m) structure was also clad in precast concrete and synthetic stucco, two materials which are commonly used in commercial construction projects, and a large water tower and a heating and air-conditioning system was installed on the roof. On the first day of testing in early April, the shake table subjected the building to identical motions to those recorded during the 1994 Northridge earthquake in Los Angeles, which measured 6.7 on the Richter scale, and the 8.8-magnitude Chile earthquake in 2010. The engineers found that the rubber bearings (or ""base isolators"") successfully protected the building from most of the damaging lateral motion that it would experience during a real earthquake. It also left lifts, stairs, medical equipment and other machinery intact, although there was some minor cosmetic damage. ""What we found is that the contents of the building carried on working after our 'earthquakes',"" said Professor Hutchinson. ""If the equipment had been life-support systems keeping real people alive, then the bearings would have saved their lives."" Engineers have now removed the base isolators from beneath the building, and over the next three weeks Professor Hutchinson will repeat the simulated earthquakes so that a direct comparison can be made between the damage to the building's contents with and without them in place. Rubber base isolators have already been retrofitted under the Los Angeles, Oakland and San Francisco city halls.",Engineers in California have unleashed high-intensity artificial earthquakes on a five-storey building packed with medical equipment.
"An unidentified programmer has produced a tool that exploits shortfalls in the way the malware encrypts a file that allows Windows to start up. In notes put on code-sharing site Github, he said he had produced the key generator to help his father-in-law unlock his Petya-encrypted computer. The malware, which started circulating in large numbers in March, demands a ransom of 0.9 bitcoins (£265). It hid itself in documents attached to emails purporting to come from people looking for work. Scrambling schemes Security researcher Lawrence Abrams, from the Bleeping Computer news site, said the key generator could unlock a Petya-encrypted computer in seven seconds. But the key generator requires victims to extract some information from specific memory locations on the infected drive. And Mr Abrams said: ""Unfortunately, for many victims extracting this data is not an easy task."" This would probably involve removing the drive and then connecting it up to another virus-free computer running Windows, he said. Another tool can then extract the data, which can be used on the website set up to help people unlock their computer. Independent security analyst Graham Cluley said there had been other occasions when ransomware makers had ""bungled"" their encryption system. Cryptolocker, Linux.encoder and one other ransomware variant were all rendered harmless when their scrambling schemes were reverse-engineered. ""Of course,"" said Mr Cluley, ""the best thing is to have safety secured backups rather than relying upon ransomware criminals goofing up.""",Petya ransomware victims can now unlock infected computers without paying.
"Tweets from prominent government officials that break the platform's rules but have been left online will be hidden behind a notice. The company accepted it had not clearly communicated many of the decisions it had made in the past. But the new notice will only be applied to tweets sent after 27 June. Unclear Twitter's critics say the platform does not enforce its rules evenly, allowing politicians to break its rules on abuse, harassment and incitement. In the past, Twitter has defended some of its decisions by saying the tweets in question were ""newsworthy"". For example, in September 2017 the company said it had decided to leave a controversial tweet by US President Donald Trump online. In the tweet, Mr Trump said: ""Just heard Foreign Minister of North Korea speak at UN. If he echoes thoughts of Little Rocket Man, they won't be around much longer!"" Many people interpreted the message as a threat to North Korea. Although Twitter decided the post was newsworthy, there was no indication of this on the Twitter app or website. Rule breakers Twitter did not say whether any particular politician had inspired the change to its rules. Tweets placed behind the new notice will no longer appear in search results and will not be promoted by the platform's algorithms. The new policy will only apply to people who: However, Twitter said in some cases - such as direct and immediate threats of violence - the tweets would still be removed. The company said most users were ""unlikely to encounter"" the new notice often. ""This is a step, although a small step, in the right direction,"" said Dr Zoetanya Sujon from the London College of Communication. ""Of course, it doesn't stop soft racism or active political disinformation. And it will not have any visible impact on Twitter's harassment problem. ""Let's hope it can spark much better practice around the regulation of disinformation, hate speech, and incitement in political and public discussion on Twitter."" However, the platform is likely to face accusations of censorship when it places the first politician's tweet behind its new notice. The company said old tweets would not be hidden behind the notice, and it could not predict when the new tool would first be used.","Twitter says it will hide tweets by world leaders and politicians that break its rules but have been left online ""in the public interest""."
"“We strongly oppose the use of legal action to silence consumers' freedom of speech,” says a message on the website. The warning comes after a man was ordered to pay £25,000 in libel damages to solicitors who sued, on the basis the review was false and defamatory. London-based Summerfield Browne said the decision to sue gave it ""no pleasure"" and was not taken lightly. New reviews have been temporarily suspended on the law firm's business page on Trustpilot after publicity about the case led to more reviews. After seeking legal advice through the company online, Philip James Waymouth left a review on the website accusing the firm of being “another scam solicitor”, court documents said. A banner at the top of Summerfield Browne's profile on Trustpilot reads: “Please be aware that this business has taken legal action against a consumer for a review left on this profile. 'Extreme measures' “We strongly oppose the use of legal action to silence consumers' freedom of speech. As a public, open, review platform we believe strongly in consumers having the ability to leave feedback - good or bad - about a business at any time, without interference. “This is the first time we’ve seen a business taking such extreme measures against a consumer voicing their genuine opinion. The vast majority of businesses on Trustpilot engage with their consumers or use our flagging tools to report content and resolve their issues."" Following the court decision, several reviews were left on Trustpilot referencing the case and writing in support of Mr Waymouth. The Trustpilot warning continues: “The business’s actions have resulted in media attention and this profile has seen a significant increase in reviews that don’t reflect an experience with the business. “Due to this, this profile has been temporarily closed for new reviews.” Trustpilot told the BBC it was never contacted by Summerfield Browne, nor was the review flagged to the website. It said it was not party to the case but “in the event that we are served with an order, we intend to challenge it”. The platform added: “We believe there are a number of errors within the judgement and it raises significant concerns around freedom of speech. “If consumers are left fearful of leaving negative reviews, this could result in consumers being misled about the quality of a business and businesses being deprived of the valuable feedback from which they can learn, improve and grow. “It is much better for businesses to engage, respond and improve upon the feedback they receive, rather than using legal action to silence consumers."" Summerfield Browne said in a statement: ""As a family firm, the decision to pursue legal action was not one we took lightly and doing so gave us no pleasure.""",Trustpilot has warned users after a business sued a man for leaving a negative review on the platform.
"By Sophia Smith GalerBBC World Service The Conservative Hype House, a group account for a number of right-wing content creators, has been posting videos featuring an identifying code assigned by the official Trump campaign - ""CHH"" - that allows users to join its text-alert service. And about six days ago, a rival Democrat group began promoting Mr Biden's rival SMS updates. Polls suggest the vast majority of American voters have already decided who to back in November's poll. But TikTok offers a way to engage first-time voters less fixed in their views. Unlike Facebook and Google, it does not allow political ads. But so long as no money changes hands, users can voice support for either presidential hopeful - and funnel others towards their official campaigns. Youthful audience Both sides' online efforts are undoubtedly focused more on Facebook, Instagram, Google and YouTube. But experts say TikTok can, if nothing else, reveal which campaign messages seem to resonate with its youthful audience. The Conservative Hype House is one of the biggest political accounts on the app, with 1.5 million followers. And during the past month, several of its videos have urged users to download the Official Trump 2020 App, directing them to a link in the channel's biography rather than directly to Apple or Google's app stores. Two of them alone, posted in mid-September, mocking Mr Biden, have amassed more than 300,000 views and 50,000 ""likes"". Asked why the Democrat Hype House was not urging TikTok users to text Mr Biden's campaign, one member replied: ""This isn't a very good answer but I think that it just never really occurred to us."" And within a day it had posted a video directing its almost 152,000 followers to do just that - and download the campaign app. Less transparent Institute of Strategic Dialogue disinformation lead Ciaran O'Connor says ads clearly flagged as political on YouTube and Facebook ""can be a legitimate, effective tool to engage new audiences, particularly younger voters"". But those promoting the candidates via TikTok and other platforms where political ads are banned may be less transparent about their methods. ""It's not clear what the nature of the relationship is between the Conservative Hype House and the president's campaign,"" he says. ""The channel is clearly supportive of Trump and his official campaign architecture. ""But there is no information to evidence a more formal partnership for promotion or advertising purposes."" 'Surrogate voices' One theory is the information is being used to identify which campaign messages drive the most texts and downloads. ""This type of profiling helps campaigns know what to say to each individual voter,"" long-time digital marketer Seth Cargiuolo says, ""what topics to email, call, and text about, what issues are important to that voter, what campaign surrogate voices may resonate with that voter, what kind of merchandise to offer to them, as well as model their behaviour and score their likelihood of showing up to vote."" President Trump has threatened to ban TikTok unless Chinese owner Bytedance relinquishes control of its US operation to database company Oracle and retail giant Walmart. ""All of the code will have to be in the United States,"" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said earlier this week, citing national security concerns. TikTok denies claims it could be compelled to hand over user data to the Chinese authorities. But the Biden campaign appears to have concerns too. And staff have been told to remove the app from their work and personal phones. But they have been in touch with the Biden Digital Coalition, a group of 200 volunteers that uses TikTok to promote the campaign's messaging. And one of its videos, posted after the candidates' first debate, on Wednesday, has attracted more than 12 million views. ""We're seeing the highest impact, as far as engagement with other users [goes, on TikTok, compared with] Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest, all the others,"" one of its members, Mary Jo Laupp, says. TikTok itself might want to ""avoid politics as much as possible"", Geoffrey Gertz, from the Brooking Institute think tank, says. But he adds: ""I don't think that's a viable strategy for the company. ""And it's going to be thrust into these political fights whether it wants to or not.""",President Trump may be threatening to shut TikTok's US operations and Joe Biden's campaign squad have effectively been barred from using the video-sharing app - but that hasn't stopped their fans using it to connect with young voters.
"State media reports that of the first 20 titles it assessed, nine were refused permission to go on sale. The Xinhua news agency added that developers of the other 11 had been told they had to make adjustments to remove ""controversial content"". There has been a clampdown on new video game releases in the country since March. The authorities have voiced concerns about the violent nature of some titles as well as worries about the activity being addictive. President Xi Jinping has also called for more to be done to tackle a rise in near-sightedness among the young - something that the country's ministry of education has linked to children playing video games at the cost of spending time on outdoor pastimes. It was announced in August that a new body - the State Administration of Press and Publications - had taken over responsibility for approving games and that it would limit the number of online titles available. And although it has not been specified, some experts are assuming that the new panel will operate under its auspices. Games backlog Until an announcement by China's Communist Party's central committee on Friday, the online video games review panel's existence had not been made public. Xinhua said it is comprised of gaming experts, government-employed researchers, and representatives from the media and video games industry. But it provided no other information about who they were or the titles they had already examined. Nor was there any hint of when the freeze on new releases might end. The Wall Street Journal suggested publishers might have to wait until at least March after the next annual meeting of parliament. Analysts appear split over how to interpret the latest development. A research note from the US-based Jefferies Financial Group described the move as being ""progressive"" and speculated that a timetable for approved video games releases would soon follow. But South Korea's Kiwoom Securities said the committee's existence indicated that the Chinese government intended to tighten regulation of the industry. One industry-watcher observed there was a big backlog to clear, meaning it could be a long while before matters settled down. ""China is the biggest games market globally - there had always been some stiffness of regulation around certain games but the mobile space had been relatively unscathed from that and there seemed to be a lot more freedom for smartphone titles,"" said Piers Harding-Rolls, research company IHS Markit's games expert. ""But you now have a new organisation and what sounds like more stringent criteria. ""There will be a learning process involved in that for publishers and I think we could be waiting six to 12 months before things return to some sort of normality.""",A panel of censors set up to vet mobile video games in China has signalled it will be hard to please.
"Jonathan Petit demonstrated how a modified, low-cost laser could create ghostlike objects in the path of autonomous cars. The cars slowed down to avoid hitting them. If enough phantom objects were created, the car would stop completely, Mr Petit told tech magazine IEEE Spectrum. Mr Petit, principal scientist at software company Security Innovation, used a laser, similar to a mass-market laser pen and added a pulse generator - something that can be created using a low-cost computer such as the Raspberry Pi. The set-up cost was just $60 (£40), he said. This device created phantom objects - cars, walls and pedestrians - that fool the ""eyes"" of self-drive cars - known as lidars. ""I can spoof thousands of objects and basically carry out a denial of service attack on the tracking system so it's not able to track real objects,"" Mr Petit told IEEE Spectrum. ""I can take echoes of a fake car and put them at any location I want,"" he added. Lidars - a combination of light and radar - work by illuminating a target with a laser and analysing the reflected light, to measure distance and map out where objects are. Thousands of these expensive sensors are used on self-driving cars. Mr Petit targeted the lidars produced by IBEO Lux but was keen to point out that it is not a problem just for them. ""I don't think any of the lidar manufacturers have thought about this or tried this,"" he told IEEE Spectrum. His paper, written while he was a research fellow at the University of Cork's computer security group, will be presented at the Black Hat Europe conference in November. Of course, for mischief-makers intent on causing chaos, there are already plenty of ways to disrupt traditional driving. Standard laser pens have proved to be a dangerous toy in the wrong hands. Reports of people pointing laser pens at drivers and pedestrians regularly hit the headlines, while several people have been sent to prison for shining the devices at police helicopters and other aircraft.","A homemade gadget can disable the systems that allow self-driving cars to see where they are going, a security researcher has said."
"The move is widely seen as a way for users of the search engine to avoid official scrutiny of where they go online, reports the Washington Post. It is also seen as a reaction to continuing revelations about the extent of surveillance of web browsing habits by the National Security Agency (NSA) . Google said it was now encrypting all the text involved in searches ""by default"" around the world. Users in other countries, such as the US and UK, have had the option to encrypt searches since 2010. ""The revelations of this past summer underscored our need to strengthen our networks,"" said Google spokeswoman Nikki Christoff in a statement. Documents taken by whistleblower Edward Snowden have shown that the NSA has had regular access to the data centres operated by Google and many other web firms. In China, the web browsing and social media habits of citizens are monitored by a very sophisticated system that attempts to stop people finding out about or sharing information on sensitive subjects. Ms Christoff said encrypting search text was just one of many improvements it had made in the past few months to help people maintain their privacy. Google reduced its presence in China in 2010 after it clashed with the nation's authorities over demands to censor searches or redirect people to government-approved sites. This has meant that Google has a very small share of all searches, about 5%, carried out in China, Most Chinese people tend to use the home-grown Baidu search engine that does comply with official censorship requests. In Europe, Google has come under fire for not doing enough to protect users' privacy. In January EU Justice Commissioner Viviane Reding said firms should face hefty fines if they abused personal data. She said fines handed down to Google over data breaches were ""pocket money"".",Google has started to encrypt searches made by people in China.
"The Facebook founder will speak about the Cambridge Analytica data scandal, Russian election interference and what the company is doing to prevent future incidents. He will say the firm's new investment in security will affect its profits. ""Protecting our community is more important,"" he adds. On the subject of users' data, he will say that every app that had access to a large amount of Facebook data prior to 2014 will be investigated. He said privacy controls had been made easier to understand. Mr Zuckerberg also admits that Facebook was slow to spot Russian meddling. Over a two year period, 126 million people were estimated to have seen Facebook content by the Internet Research Agency, a Russian propaganda organisation, he said. However, Facebook has since developed better AI tools to shut down fake accounts, he will tell Congress. Advertising policies have also been amended to include identity checks on advertisers wishing to run political ads, and people who run pages with large followings. ""My top priority has always been our social mission of connecting people, building community,"" Mr Zuckerberg said. ""Advertisers and developers will never take priority over that as long as I'm running Facebook."" Analysis: Dave Lee, BBC North America Technology Reporter What is missing from this statement, and likely to be asked by lawmakers, is why it took a newspaper to discover this breach of Facebook's systems. And, once Facebook knew, why it didn't notify the public and regulators immediately - instead of doing everything it could to block the story. The measures put out by Facebook in recent days are good, common sense ideas - such as disabling data sharing with any app you don't use for more than three months. By why did it take so long? Why weren't these protections built-in in the first place? Mark Zuckerberg is going to try and highlight the good things Facebook has brought to our lives, of which there are many. But I don't expect US representatives to give him too much credit for that - not this week, anyway.","Mark Zuckerberg has revealed his planned testimony to the US Congress, ahead of answering questions during a two day hearing about data privacy."
"A smaller number of homes - about 10,000 - will need to switch to satellite or cable TV services in order to avoid degraded picture quality. Homes that cannot receive these alternative platforms will receive up to £10,000 each to ""find a solution"". Costs will be met by the winner of a spectrum auction later this year. Consultations are currently being held into how spectrum - part of which is used by analogue television - will be offered to mobile operators once airwaves are freed up by the switch to digital. These airwaves are crucial to mobile operators to create next-generation mobile services. The winning bidder, or bidders, will be required to pay for the costs of making sure viewers of digital terrestrial television (DTT) will not be affected by the changes. Unwanted noise In a consultation document released in August last year, media regulator Ofcom estimated that about 760,000 homes could be affected. However, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) told the BBC that further research had suggested that number was likely to be closer to 900,000. Homes falling within a certain range of transmitter towers will automatically have a filter issued, while a helpline will be set up to deal with interference cases outside of the predicted areas. The filter, which is fitted to a digital TV box, blocks out unwanted noise from the 4G signal. It can be fitted without the help of an engineer - but over-75s and disabled people will be given assistance if needed. The DCMS said that in a very small number of homes, the filters would not be sufficient. A platform change - to satellite or cable - will be required, the cost of which will also be covered by the mobile operator. It is estimated that about 10,000 homes may need to take this measure. It is also predicted that about 500 homes affected by interference will be unable to receive satellite or cable services. In these cases, expected to be in rural areas, up to £10,000 per household will be provided to fund alternative solutions to receiving television - such as having fibre cabling installed. The DCMS said it predicted that small groups of affected houses would be able to pool their funding in order to pay for bigger investments like additional relay transmitters. 'Disruptive' Without the preventative measures, television pictures would become unclear and fragmented, warned Saverio Romeo, an industry analyst from Frost & Sullivan. ""The LTE [Long Term Evolution] spectrum, particularly on 800Mhz, overlaps part of the DTT spectrum,"" he said. ""The closer you are to a base station, the more disruptive the interference."" He said that in addition to the £10,000 fund for the severely disrupted homes, education should be provided in order to help people understand what options were available. ""If you give £10,000 to a lady in Cumbria and say: 'You need to fix it' - I don't think it's enough. ""You need to help people understand new technologies. It's not enough to give subsidies."" A spokesman for the DCMS said additional advice would be given to those receiving the financial help. Culture Minister Ed Vaizey said adoption of 4G would provide a boost to the UK's digital economy. ""Next-generation mobile services are essential for economic growth. They will bring an estimated benefit of £2-3bn to the UK economy. ""There will be some interference when 4G services are rolled out but we will have the solutions in place to eliminate the disruption to television viewers.""",Almost a million UK homes will need to have filters installed to prevent TV interference from 4G mobile signals - at a cost of £108m.
"Analysis firm Ovum studied global use of popular services like Whatsapp, Blackberry Messenger and Facebook chat. It concluded that mobile operators must ""work together to face the challenge from major internet players"". Industry experts say operators can offset any losses through effective costing plans by mobile networks. The reportgathered usage statistics from the leading social messaging applications typically used on smartphones across the world. As well as well-known names from popular social networks in the Western world, the study also included apps such as MXit - a massively popular program used mainly in South Africa. Social messaging apps make use of a smartphone's internet connection to send messages rather than the usually far costlier SMS - short message service - system. However, the study did not factor in the extra income networks received from mobile data costs because of increased internet usage resulting from social messaging. The research's author, Neha Dharia, said operators must look to work closely with the big players in social messaging. ""Operators must remain open to partnering with app developers, sharing end-user data with them and allowing integration with the user's social connections,"" she said. ""Working closely with handset vendors will also be important; they control some of the most popular social messaging apps, and can also provide preloaded applications."" Avoiding costs James Barford, a mobile analyst for Enders, said while the figures seemed huge, social messaging still only represented a tiny part of overall mobile communication. ""It isn't a huge amount of the global industry,"" Mr Barford told the BBC. ""A lot of those people using those types of apps are using them to avoid international messaging. ""Sometimes they are avoiding costs that they wouldn't have paid anyway - maybe in the replacement of email or some other method of communication."" Mr Barford added that a study conducted in April 2011 by research firm Comscore suggested that 4% of UK smartphone users had sent a message on Whatsapp that month. Another survey, carried out in June 2011 by YouGov, showed that the huge majority of smartphone users - 81% - still considered SMS the key way to send messages on a mobile. ""I think it's a growing threat which is manageable through the right tariffs and the right costing,"" Mr Barford added. ""People are still using the mobile networks to communicate - and they're willing to pay for that.""","Social messaging applications cost mobile network operators $13.9bn (£8.8bn) in lost SMS revenue last year, a report has claimed."
"By Michael Cowan & Livvy HaydockBBC File on 4 Jamie - not his real name - is in his early 20s . For the last few years he made money by scamming women, usually those a lot older than him, who were looking for love. He did this while in prison for an unrelated crime, using an illegal mobile phone he had hidden. He was recently released and spoke to the BBC's File on 4 programme. He says he will not commit the fraud again, and wants to make amends by exposing some of his tactics to serve as a warning to others. 'It was work' ""It was a last resort kind of thing, I just saw how easy it was,"" Jamie says. ""The most I ever got from a girl was £10,000... every week she was sending me £100, £200. ""I've forgotten her name now, I don't see it as a relationship, I [saw] it as work."" He says his accounts were blocked after the victims reported them, but he was never punished for the frauds. He says people using dating apps should watch out for men contacting them who are a lot younger or ""better looking"", who start asking for money, especially if they have never met in person. Jamie says he picked his targets by looking for those he thought likely to be lonely and lacking attention from others on the apps. His theory was that they would be more willing to ""do anything"" to avoid risk losing the connection. And he says he would use his real photographs, confident that his looks would help lure victims in. ""I would go for older women and look for the desperation,"" he says. ""Keywords would be like 'I just want happiness' or something like that. I'll act cool at the start and if she talks back then I know she's interested just from my pictures. ""From then, that's when I start putting my game on, selling you dreams like 'I want a kid with you.' ""[I] just say everything that she wants to hear until she's fallen in love."" Until he felt that his victim was emotionally attached, Jamie said he wouldn't tell them he was in prison. He claims that he often messaged women for months, charming them before revealing the fact. When he did, he says he lied about the reason he was jailed, telling women it was for driving offences rather than violent crime. 'He was charming' In 2020, there were nearly 7,000 reports of so-called romance fraud. It cost victims almost £70m last year. And according to trade association UK Finance, there has been a 20% increase in bank transfers relating to romance fraud during the pandemic. Di Pogson, a 59-year-old widow, gave away her entire life savings of £40,000 to someone she met on a dating app. It turned out to be a scam. The man she'd fallen for did not really exist. He was the creation of three fraudsters who preyed on vulnerable women across southern England. ""I always had in the back of my mind that I would never, ever be conned. I was too savvy,"" she says. ""But then 'Kevin' came along and he was charming. He was interested in me. ""It started off at just under £500 for his vet bills, and the sums gradually went up. ""When I completely ran out of money, he called me all sorts of names, he stopped answering his phone. ""Alarm bells rang and I went to the police."" She says she felt gullible and stupid. ""I told the children. It was horrible having to tell them I had lost so much money to somebody I had never met."" PC Bernadette Laurie, a financial abuse safeguarding officer, says many of the cases reported to police last year happened during lockdown, when people felt more lonely than usual. Victims often discovered they had been fooled, she adds, when the criminals failed to meet up after the restrictions eased. She recommends following advice by Action Fraud. How to spot a scam These behaviours could signal your prospective partner is not what they claim to be: One way of checking on photos can be to do a reverse image search via Google Images, Bing Visual Search, TinEye or another similar service. Twenty-five of the UK's police forces also provided data in response to a freedom of information request made by File on 4. This suggested that of the country's most popular dating apps, Tinder, Plenty of Fish and Grindr were the ones most associated with crime reports between 2018 and 2020. Over this time, the number of crime reports associated with dating apps rose by 24% to 903 reports last year. This is only a partial data set. Eighteen forces, including some of the country's biggest like the Metropolitan Police, Greater Manchester Police, PSNI, and Police Scotland, did not provide data, meaning the actual crime numbers are likely to be significantly higher.

"So far, UK trials of the autonomous vehicles have taken place only on private land. Driverless cars are guided by a system of sensors and cameras and are seen as potentially safer and more efficient than regular vehicles. As a safety measure, a back-up driver will ride along during tests who can take over in case of emergency. Test track The plans have been unveiled in a blueprint by the Department for Transport, as part of a £28bn investment in British roads to reduce congestion. The report says driverless vehicles are capable of driving on their own ""using knowledge of the environment in which they are driving"". ""They maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front at a set speed and without deviating from their lane - all without the driver's input,"" said the report. For now, the cars will be driven on lightly-used rural and suburban roads in a ""semi-autonomous"" mode which gives human passengers the choice to intervene. They will be tested by the same team of Oxford University researchers who have been developing and testing autonomous car technology on an adapted Nissan Leaf around Oxford Science Park. The technology uses lasers and small cameras to memorise regular journeys like the commute or the school run. Prof Paul Newman, who leads the Oxford team, told the BBC he was excited by the public trials in the UK. ""It's a great area to be working in because it's IT and computers and that's what changes things. The British government sees that engineering is important."" The UK announcement follows public trials in other parts of the world. The US is leading the way, with three states - Nevada, Florida and California - all passing legislation around autonomous cars. ""Far fetched"" Google has led efforts in the private sector, with its fleet of prototypes of a converted Toyota Prius covering more than 300,000 miles on public roads. Google co-founder Sergey Brin said he believed the self-driving car would ""dramatically improve the quality of life for everyone"", and that it would be commercially available within the decade. Prof Newman acknowledged that Google were ""trailblazers"" but added: ""They're not the only game in town."" Although initiatives so far have focused on adapting existing cars, many leading car makers including Ford, Audi and Volvo have also expressed their interest in developing the technology as the cost comes down, potentially paving the way for widespread use in mid-range vehicles. They link an array of technologies inside the vehicle such as lane keep assist, advanced intelligent cruise control and advanced emergency braking in a so-called ""sensor fusion"". Paul Watters, head of roads policy at the AA, urged caution. ""In the past our members have expressed concern about fully autonomous cars, preferring human interaction,"" he told the BBC. ""The notion of reading the newspapers and drinking a cup of coffee is a bit far-fetched. It's early days and driverless cars won't be mainstream for a long time."" ""But we have a variety of in-car technologies already, including guided parking and adaptive cruise control, so fully driverless cars will be the culmination of a gradual evolution, not an overnight revolution.""","Driverless cars will be tested on public roads by the end of 2013, says the UK government."
"Security researcher Michael Myng found the keylogging code in software drivers preinstalled on HP laptops to make the keyboard work. HP said more than 460 models of laptop were affected by the ""potential security vulnerability"". It has issued a software patch for its customers to remove the keylogger. The issue affects laptops in the EliteBook, ProBook, Pavilion and Envy ranges, among others. HP has issued a full list of affected devices, dating back to 2012.

According to HP, it was originally built into the Synaptics software to help debug errors. It acknowledged that could lead to ""loss of confidentiality"" but it said neither Synaptics nor HP had access to customer data as a result of the flaw. In May, a similar keylogger was discovered in the audio drivers pre-installed on several HP laptop models.

"The 51-year-old politician was leader of the Liberal Democrats and formed a coalition government with David Cameron and the Conservatives in 2010. Facebook has faced intense scrutiny and the threat of government regulation following the Cambridge Analytica data scandal and alleged election meddling. Several prominent executives have left the company in the last year. Sir Nick's new job title will be vice-president of global affairs and communications at Facebook. He will start work on Monday and will spend a week at the company's Menlo Park headquarters, before moving to California with his family permanently in the new year. Sir Nick told BBC media editor Amol Rajan he has been working on the frontier between technology and politics for the last few years. ""I thought, I could do this academically, as a commentator, running a start-up, but then I thought, in for a penny, in for a pound,"" he explained. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg were personally involved in the recruitment, the Financial Times reported. In a statement, Sir Nick said he was delighted to join the company. ""Having spoken at length to Mark and Sheryl over the last few months, I have been struck by their recognition that the company is on a journey which brings new responsibilities not only to the users of Facebook's apps but to society at large. I hope I will be able to play a role in helping to navigate that journey,"" he wrote. The former Lib Dem leader has expanded further on his reasons for joining the company in a Guardian article, stating that he remains ""a stubborn optimist about the progressive potential to society of technological innovation"". He added: ""If the tech industry can work sensibly with governments, regulators, parliaments and civic society around the world, I believe we can enhance the benefits of technology while diminishing the often unintended downsides."" A rough year for Facebook: Sir Nick has previously written about Facebook for a number of UK newspapers. In 2016, he wrote in the Evening Standard: ""I'm not especially bedazzled by Facebook. While I have good friends who work at the company, I actually find the messianic Californian new-worldy-touchy-feely culture of Facebook a little grating."" What does Facebook want Sir Nick for? Analysis by Chris Fox, BBC technology reporter Facebook has had a turbulent few years and is trying to get a grip on its policies and reputation. The Cambridge Analytica data scandal revealed that the personal information of millions of people had been misused, potentially influencing the results of elections. The company has also removed ""billions"" of fake accounts, linked to the spread of fake news and disinformation, possibly connected to countries such as Russia and Iran. Facebook hopes Sir Nick will challenge the company on its issues. With his political experience as part of the UK government, and as a former MEP, he will also be well-placed to advise how to keep the regulators away. In a Facebook post, Sheryl Sandberg said the company needed ""new perspectives to help us though this time of change"". Sir Nick is not the first Liberal Democrat to take a senior role at Facebook. Lord Allan of Hallam is currently the company's public policy chief for Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Who is Sir Nick Clegg? Nick Clegg was a Liberal Democrat MP for Sheffield Hallam from 2005 until 2017. In 2010, when he was leader of the Liberal Democrats, he became deputy prime minister in a coalition government with the Conservatives. But he faced a backlash from his supporters when he broke a promise that he would vote against any rise in university tuition fees. The Liberal Democrats lost a majority of their seats in the 2015 general election, ending up with just eight MPs, down from 57. Although he had kept his own seat, Nick Clegg resigned as the party leader. He lost his seat in the snap general election of 2017, but was given a knighthood in January 2018. In his statement announcing his new job at Facebook, he said it was ""wrenching"" to ""leave the public debate at a crucial time in the Brexit process"". ""But the key decisions will soon pass to Parliament, of which I am no longer a member, and once I had decided to take up this unique new challenge at Facebook, I felt it was best to get going sooner rather than later,"" he said. Jon Trickett MP, Labour's shadow minister for the cabinet office, said Sir Nick's new job was ""a damning indictment of the sorry state of our country's politics"". ""At a time when digital giants such as Facebook are rightly coming under public scrutiny, our former deputy prime minister has been hired to lobby on their behalf."" Analysis by Rory Cellan-Jones, BBC technology correspondent In the UK, the reaction has been ""What?"" while in the United States and elsewhere most people will say ""Who?"" - so why has Facebook decided that Sir Nick Clegg is the right fit for one of the most challenging - and best paid - jobs in communications? From the moment in the summer that Sir Nick's predecessor, Elliot Schrage, announced he was leaving, Facebook made clear that it was not going to look inside or to other seasoned PR professionals for his replacement. Instead, bruised and blinking in the spotlight after a catalogue of scandals tarnished its image, it wanted someone who could guide it through choppy political waters in Washington, Brussels and elsewhere. Given how partisan US politics have become, choosing an American politician would have brought allegations of bias. In the UK, Sir Nick may be a divisive figure - especially over Brexit - but elsewhere that will not be such an issue. Facebook will hope that someone who has survived - just about - the cauldron of British politics will not flinch under fire from US senators or EU regulators. Sir Nick may find he needs to challenge Mark Zuckerberg pretty frequently. Just how well he handles his relationship with his new boss will be crucial. If he succeeds he could wield more power than he ever did in politics. If the relationship sours he will be heading home from California pretty quickly. The 'coalition quad' - where are they now? David Cameron After quitting as prime minister in September 2016, Mr Cameron has taken on a raft of paid and unpaid roles - straddling both the private and charitable sectors. Most recently, he became a paid consultant to life-sciences firm Illumina and vice-chairman of a new UK-China investment fund. He also sits on the boards of a number of organisations involved in international development and foreign relations as well as being president of Alzheimer's Research UK. Sir Nick Clegg Before the former deputy prime minister was hired by Facebook he was busy with his thinktank Open Reason, campaigning for a referendum on the final Brexit deal, and writing his book How To Stop Brexit. George Osborne The former chancellor added what is thought to be his eighth role to his bulging portfolio of post-politics jobs in May. The London Evening Standard editor was made chairman of a panel of advisers to Exor, which owns Juventus football club and has major stakes in Ferrari and Fiat Chrysler cars. It comes on top of academic posts and a £650,000 a year role with US investment fund Blackrock. Sir Danny Alexander After losing his parliamentary seat in 2015, Sir Danny went on to work with the Britain Stronger in Europe campaign and schools cricket charity Chance To Shine. He became vice-president of Chinese-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank in 2016. And what about..? Ed Balls The former Labour cabinet minister took on academic roles when he left politics before a stint on Strictly Come Dancing in 2016 saw him turn his attentions to television, where his BBC documentary, Travels in Trumpland, has proved a success this year.

"The robotaxis are to be deployed in places where ride-hailing drivers are less available, according to Meng Xing, Didi’s chief operating officer. Mr Meng was speaking at an online conference hosted by the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post newspaper. One analyst suggested it was a very ambitious aim. “I’ll be surprised if we see a million by 2030,” a spokesman for market research firm Canalys said. “I hope that happens but there’s a lot to take place in meantime.” He pointed out that it was a strange time to make such a commitment, given the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. In 2016, US tech giant Apple ploughed $1bn (£800m) into Didi in an unusually large and public investment. Apple is known to be interested in the development of autonomous driving, having tested its own driverless vehicle on public roads in California in recent years. However, there was no reason to think that Apple’s autonomous driving research would expand as a result of Didi’s work in the area, Canalys suggested. Recently, Didi signed a deal with Chinese carmaker BAIC Group to jointly develop customised self-driving vehicles, and in May the firm received a $500m investment in its autonomous vehicles division from SoftBank.",Chinese ride-hailing firm Didi Chuxing says it plans to operate more than a million self-driving vehicles by 2030.
"The new page shows real-time updates from celebrities and news websites, and lets people search through tweets. The design was trialled in the US and Japan and will now roll out in a further 21 countries, including the UK. One analyst said the company was trying to widen its appeal, but needed to tackle issues that could put people off using the service. ""The old homepage was targeted at getting people to sign up for an account or download the app,"" said David Wilkinson, managing partner at digital consultancy Soho Strategy. ""This is a bid to expand its appeal beyond the registered users, and get people to engage with content regardless of whether they're signed in. ""But it's also a recognition that algorithmic curation of content is beating human curation, and that its timeline model could be flawed."" Twitter has struggled with competition from rivals such as Snapchat and Facebook, and its share price has tumbled since its stock market debut in 2014. The social network currently attracts about 500 million visitors every month, but has only 320 million registered members. The redesigned homepage, which will roll out on the Twitter website and mobile site, draws in live updates from some of the website's most prolific tweeters. ""Starting today, anyone can explore and discover different topics and stories as they occur, including some that are tailored just for you based on your location,"" the company said in a statement. Previously, the website's homepage outside the US and Japan displayed only a large photograph and a log-in panel, without indicating what registered users could do or see on the website. ""It shows Twitter's recognition that an algorithmic way of curating content, like on Facebook, is something that might interest people,"" said Mr Wilkinson. ""It's still a huge platform for brands and celebrities to communicate with the public, and they can now reach a larger audience outside of those who follow them. ""But they're playing catch-up when it comes to curating content, and this shows they're developing their own means of filtering.""",Twitter is rolling out a new homepage designed to engage people who have not logged in to the website.
"An amendment to the Unfair Competition Prevention Act, introduced in December, made it a crime to sell devices that circumvent security controls. The games company said the case involved the sale of kit designed to work with its DS handheld console. It said it hoped the case would discourage other illegal vendors. Nintendo says police in the central Aichi region made the arrest. The case involves the sale of Majikon - adapters which accept memory cards containing software. When plugged into a console's cartridge slot the machine activates a special interface which then allows the user to select which program to run off a SD memory card. Pirate plug-in Majikon manufacturers claim the equipment is designed to allow gamers to run home-made software. However, they have been widely used to play pirated games downloaded from the internet and copied onto the SD cards. Although Japan outlawed the devices years ago, those found selling them did not face criminal sanctions until the end of last year. As a result trade in the kit continued. Japan is not the only country to target the equipment. The UK's High Court banned the adapters in 2010. They were being sold in the UK as R4 cartridges. Nintendo says there have been similar rulings in South Korea, Taiwan, Italy, the Netherlands and Germany.","Authorities in Japan have arrested a suspected video games pirate in the first case of its kind, according to Nintendo."
"By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor The Microsoft-owned chat app said that the move reflected the public preference for using mobile devices to make video calls from the living room, despite the size advantage TVs offered. It will continue to maintain the service until June. Afterwards, it will be up to individual manufacturers to decide whether to remove the app or continue offering an unsupported service. Skype's intention to focus its efforts on phones and tablets comes at a time when it faces heightened competition. Although Google's rival Hangouts service has had limited appeal on mobiles, Facebook's Messenger and Apple's Facetime apps are making more headway. In addition, Xiaomi recently launched its own Mi Video Call service, and Slack has announced plans to add support for video chats to its popular business-focused chat tool. Rise and fall Skype for TV was first unveiled at the CES tech show in January 2010 and was marketed as a way to let families ""share the limelight [from their sofa] so there's no more huddling around the computer or missing an out-of-shot moment"". It required TVs to be fitted with either a built-in camera or a plug-in peripheral. TV-makers that adopted the service included Samsung, LG, Sony, Panasonic, Sharp, Toshiba and Philips. ""Over the years, users have changed the way they use Skype, with the majority accessing it from a mobile device - including when in the living room,"" reads a message posted to the app's support page. ""We want to make sure we prioritise delivering the best possible experience to the platforms our users are asking for, which is why we've decided to focus our efforts in other areas while supporting key functionality on Skype for TV for as long as possible."" Samsung has already announced that its TVs will stop offering the app from 2 June. 'No way back' Many science-fiction movies and comics had envisioned that people would want to chat to each other via large screens in their homes. But one expert said that technology had gone down a ""very different route"". ""On paper the idea of using a TV for things like Skype made a lot of sense - it's a non-threatening device that people were already comfortable with, so it seemed a good way to get the tech into the living room,"" said Chris Green, a technology analyst at the consultancy Lewis. ""But the ubiquity of mobile devices made video conferencing on TVs redundant. ""No-one ever got used to using a big screen for Skype because they never needed to - people are far more used to picking up a tablet and doing it that way - and I don't think there's a way back now.""",Skype has announced that it is ending support for its smart TV software.
"Dave LeeNorth America technology reporter Sure, the labels get royalties but it's pennies - fractions of pennies - on what they used to get from ""traditional"" online sales. Regardless, it's been clear for a long time that streaming is the music industry's future. On Wednesday, Spotify announced it would go public - but that's not to say it is here to stay. The company has long been surrounded by threats, and it's no different today. Apple, Amazon and Google are also in the streaming game and - unlike Spotify - all sell devices on which consumers can listen to music. And while Spotify has signed deals with all the ""big three"" record labels - Warner, Universal and Sony - it is the music executives that still hold the bargaining chips. Even if Spotify has been able to negotiate a lower per-listen payment, the combined cost of paying out royalties only ever follows one trajectory: up. Even geographically, Spotify has its challenges. It has pleaded, sometimes successfully, with the Swedish government to loosen immigration laws so it can bring top talent to Sweden and keep the company in its birthplace. (The company has remained in Stockholm, but many of the firm's jobs are now in New York City.) As it makes its formal IPO announcement, it has kept most of the wolves from the door, but not all. Here's what Spotify said on Wednesday: ""Our current and future competitors may have higher brand recognition, more established relationships with music and other content licensors and mobile device manufacturers, greater financial, technical, and other resources, more sophisticated technologies, and/or more experience in the markets in which we compete."" It went on to point out that Apple and Google, its main threats, have incredible control. For each paying customer Spotify attracts, more often than not either Apple or Google will get a cut of that revenue, thanks to the firms taking a percentage of all in-app payments on iOS and Android respectively. Despite all this, Spotify is still here, 159m users strong. But if it wants to retain its place as the world's most popular streaming service, there are three big ideas it must consider. 1. Understand me better than anyone else (even myself) Every Monday, Spotify drops a custom playlist into every single user's account, filled with songs it thinks you will like. While many companies have promised to achieve a recommendation algorithm that gets it right, none have come close to the quality of Spotify's Discover Weekly list. ""Discover Weekly on Spotify knows me better than I know myself,"" wrote one Twitter user. ""I want to date the algorithm that makes my Discover Weekly playlist on Spotify,"" said another. Part of the reason it's so well regarded is thanks to considerable investment into advanced recommendation algorithms. A deft strategic move in 2014 saw Spotify buy The Echo Nest, a firm that analyses data to predict future listening habits. In buying the company, not only did Spotify boost the quality of its own recommendations, it lowered that of its competitors. The Echo Nest was working with Apple, Amazon and Google - but not anymore. Spotify said it would continue to make ""significant"" investments in such technologies. It's a key differentiator. -If Spotify's recommendations ""get you"" more than the others, it will win. There are few things in life more satisfying than discovering new music. 2. Create a record label Spotify took in $5bn in revenue in 2017, but posted a loss of $1.4bn. Why? Because it's paying out buckets in royalty payments to record labels - more than 70% of its entire expenditure. One solution to balancing the books might be to create a major record label of its own. Take Netflix, a company that saves millions by creating its own content, therefore avoiding the need to negotiate deal-after-deal to bring shows to different markets around the world. The so-called Netflix Originals now form the bedrock of Netflix's popularity, and there's no reason why Spotify couldn't do the same with music. In fact, it already has a massive head start. The same data that powers its recommendation engine could power its decisions on who to sign, and what to produce. Record executives have made their millions by getting into the brains of teenagers and putting together the One Directions of the world. Big data, and a few big hires, could have Spotify doing the same with an arguably greater chance of success. With artists on board, Spotify can own the complete music distribution circle, saving money at every turn. Spotify artists would get free marketing on the world's biggest music streaming site. And the company wouldn't need to pay royalties on music it already owns. By harnessing the same payment system existing subscribers are already using, Spotify could become the only place fans can buy gig tickets to see those artists. And, of course, Spotify artists would be exclusive to Spotify. All these savings could mean more money direct to the artist, just the incentive a new act might need to shun a deal with a traditional label. 3. Sell its own hardware Last month Apple launched its HomePod speaker, a great-sounding, table-staining device that will stream music - but on one important condition: you can only use Apple Music. Other home assistants, like Google's Home and Amazon Alexa, could theoretically do the same with their own music services, though right now are holding back due to neither company enjoying quite the same brand loyalty as Apple (nor, you might say, the arrogance). Spotify is decidedly ill-equipped to handle a market in which the hardware maker turns king maker, blocking all but its own services on its device. And even if Amazon doesn't completely block Spotify on Alexa, for instance, it might make it less interactive, so only the less innovative commands are possible. To get around this, Spotify may need to look into making hardware itself, though of the three suggestions I've made in this piece, this is the most difficult - and least likely. A Spotify home speaker would give the company complete control over how its service is received. It might even be given to new premium subscribers, like some kind of modern-day carriage clock incentive. But while Spotify's brand is strong, it's only for one thing - streaming music. It will take huge investment and marketing spend to lure customers away from HomePod and Alexa, and even then people are more likely to move to hardware makers like Sonos or Bose. As for avoiding being a slave to Apple and Google's mobile dominance - forget about it. Short of building its own operating system, there's not much it can do. Apart from, maybe, lobbying for competition rules that prevented those companies from taking advantage of their dominant positions. For now, Spotify's strategy needs to be about making its service so good that users insist on being able to access it fairly on any new or existing device. The way to do that is through even better recommendations, exclusives, and a bigger push into other content areas like podcasts and video - maybe even live broadcasts. Whatever happens will be worth watching closely. This IPO marks the second ""David"" tech company to go public in the past 12 months. The first was Snap, the owner of Snapchat, which appears to be getting gradually beaten down by one Goliath, Facebook. Spotify has many predators, and the odds seem stacked against it. But then, for the little start-up from Stockholm, that's always been the case.",The fact that Spotify exists at all is something of a minor miracle: unknown Swedish company convinces major record labels to upload millions upon millions of songs for people to listen to without buying them. It must have been quite the pitch.
"By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter Vittorio Di Mauro told the BBC the situation was ""a nightmare"". Many big names pulled out of the event over concerns about the spread of coronavirus. Organiser the GSMA said that meant it was ""impossible"" for the event to go ahead, adding it was a ""dark day"" in the history of the annual tech event. Mr Di Mauro runs Connectlab which makes internet connected devices. His firm had spent around 50,000 euros on the conference, which he said was ""a lot of money for us"" but not as significant as the lack of contact with clients. ""We are very disappointed, and not just because of the money we spent but not having the chance to meet customers. Barcelona is much more than a trade show, it is a meeting point for everyone in the industry,"" he told the BBC. Head scratching His firm is already coping with problems related to the coronavirus outbreak as its manufacturing base is in Shenzhen, where many of the factories remain closed to stop the spread of the virus. ""These past couple of weeks have been a nightmare,"" he said. ""This is a difficult time, like driving on the motorway and a fog descends with no visibility and you don't know what is ahead of you."" When he heard MWC was cancelled, he sent a bunch of hasty emails rearranging meetings with clients in Europe and is contemplating a trip to meet customers based in the US - all of which will mean more flights and more expense. ""I woke up and I was scratching my head about what to do. Some meetings at MWC are organised but some happen by chance, so how do we recreate that?"" However, he plans to go back to the event next year. ""Big companies may decide that they can do without Barcelona but that's not possible for companies like us. Everyone is in one place and that is very valuable,"" he said. 'Dark day' Mobile analyst Ben Wood said many smaller firms might be considering whether to attend next year because ""they have had to swallow many of the costs from this year's show"". ""The GSMA now needs to be careful that there is not a knock-on effect from this year's cancellation. Major companies and many attendees will be reviewing the importance of MWC to their business and the GSMA must work hard to have a clear path forward,"" he said. And he pointed out the big tech players often hosted their own events - ""set-piece launches where they can control the message away from the hustle and bustle of a tradeshow"". Many of those firms are now hastily arranging press conferences for new products that they had intended to show off at the conference. Sony plans to launch its new phone - expected to be the Xperia 2 - via a YouTube video at the time the press conference was scheduled to take place. Meanwhile, organisers of the event have been attempting to clarify why the show was cancelled amid speculation about the true reason. ""This is not about money - it's about health and safety and the reputation of our show,"" said Mats Granryd, director general of the GSMA. Rumours had circulated that the organisers had wanted city officials to declare a health emergency in order to claim back expenses on insurance. Mr Granryd described events as a ""force majeure"", a legal term for unforeseeable circumstances. ""There is no way you can insure yourself out of a force majeure situation."" According to its website, the GSMA takes out standard insurance cover on behalf of exhibitors, which does not cover the spread of communicable diseases unless health authorities issue travel restrictions. The association's chief executive, John Hoffman, promised the event would be back next year. ""It is a very dark day, it is very disappointing. But we know the sun will shine,"" he said. ""This is about our future together, and we look forward to hosting all of you, all of our partners from around the world, for MWC '21.""",The cancellation of technology conference Mobile World Congress has left one start-up founder counting the cost in potential lost business.

It marks the first use of AI technology to review messages on the network since founder Mark Zuckerberg announced last month that he also hoped to use algorithms to identify posts by terrorists, among other concerning content. Facebook also announced new ways to tackle suicidal behaviour on its Facebook Live broadcast tool and has partnered with several US mental health organisations to let vulnerable users contact them via its Messenger platform. Pattern recognition Facebook has offered advice to users thought to be at risk of suicide for years, but until now it had relied on other users to bring the matter to its attention by clicking on a post's report button. It has now developed pattern-recognition algorithms to recognise if someone is struggling, by training them with examples of the posts that have previously been flagged. Talk of sadness and pain, for example, would be one signal. Responses from friends with phrases such as ""Are you OK?"" or ""I'm worried about you,"" would be another. Once a post has been identified, it is sent for rapid review to the network's community operations team. ""We know that speed is critical when things are urgent,"" Facebook product manager Vanessa Callison-Burch told the BBC. The director of the US National Suicide Prevention Lifeline praised the effort, but said he hoped Facebook would eventually do more than give advice, by also contacting those that could help. ""It's something that we have been discussing with Facebook,"" said Dr John Draper. ""The more we can mobilise the support network of an individual in distress to help them, the more likely they are to get help. ""The question is how we can do that in a way that doesn't feel invasive. ""I would say though that what they are now offering is a huge step forward."" Ms Callison-Burch acknowledged that contact from friends or family was typically more effective than a message from Facebook, but added that it would not always be appropriate for it to inform them. ""We're sensitive to privacy and I think we don't always know the personal dynamics between people and their friends in that way, so we're trying to do something that offers support and options,"" she said. The latest effort to help Facebook Live users follows the death of a 14-year-old-girl in Miami, who livestreamed her suicide on the platform in January. However, the company said it had already begun work on its new tools before the tragedy. The goal is to help at-risk users while they are broadcasting, rather than wait until their completed video has been reviewed some time later. Now, when someone watching the stream clicks a menu option to declare they are concerned, Facebook displays advice to the viewer about ways they can support the broadcaster. The stream is also flagged for immediate review by Facebook's own team, who then overlay a message with their own suggestions if appropriate. ""Some might say we should cut off the stream of the video the moment there is a hint of somebody talking about suicide,"" said Jennifer Guadagno, Facebook's lead researcher on the project. ""But what the experts emphasised was that cutting off the stream too early would remove the opportunity for people to reach out and offer support. ""So, this opens up the ability for friends and family to reach out to a person in distress at the time they may really need it the most."" The new system is being rolled out worldwide. A new option to contact a choice of crisis counsellor helplines via Facebook's Messenger tool, however, is limited to the US for now. Facebook said it needed to check whether other organisations would be able to cope with demand before it expanded the facility. ""Their ongoing and future efforts give me great hope for saving more lives globally from the tragedy of suicide,"" said Dr Dan Reiden executive director of Save.org, which is involved in the initiative. ""The opportunity for prevention, even with Facebook Live, is better now than ever before."" If you are depressed and need to ask for help, there's advice on who to contact at BBC Advice. Alternatively, call Samaritans on 116123 or Childline on 0800 1111.",Facebook has begun using artificial intelligence to identify members that may be at risk of killing themselves.
"By Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent One network's tactics included mixing its material with content from real news outlets, such as recorded TV news output and the BBC News theme music. It also hijacked Facebook accounts, and posted tutorial videos to teach other Jihadists how to do it. Facebook said it had ""no tolerance for terrorist propaganda"". The Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD), which carried out the study, tracked 288 Facebook accounts linked to a particular ISIS network over three months. The group behind them was able to exploit gaps in both the automated and manual moderation systems on Facebook, to generate tens of thousands of views of their material. Facebook said all of them have now been removed. Networks of ISIS supporters were also found to be plotting, preparing and launching 'raids' on other Facebook pages, including those belonging to the US military and political leaders. The ISD researchers say they watched in real-time as instructions were posted for followers to flood comment sections of the sites with terrorist material. One attack targeted US President Trump's Facebook page with fake African-American accounts. Another put images of the 11 September 2001 attack on the US Department of Defense and Air Force Academy pages, along with messages. 'Digital territory' On 7 April, a series of Twitter accounts began to send out links to a Facebook Watch party. The accounts all used the phrase 'Fuouaris Upload', a reference to medieval Islamic warriors. The ISD researchers say this was part of a co-ordinated attempt to 'amass digital territory' on Facebook. The network shared video content which received tens of thousands of views, and which extended out to other platforms with links to Telegram, WhatsApp, ISIS stand-alone websites and SoundCloud. The researchers believe that at the centre of the network was one user who managed around a third (90 out of 288) of the Facebook profiles. At times, this user would boast of holding 100 'war spoils' accounts, saying: ""They delete one account, and I replace it with 10 others."" This was accomplished by generating real North American phone numbers and looking for associated Facebook accounts. If it found a match it would request a re-set code to be sent to the phone number, so it could lock out the original account holder and use the Facebook profile to spread content. Blurred logos The researchers say another key to the survival of ISIS content on the platform was the way in which ISIS supporters have learned to modify their content to evade controls. This included: Facebook has tried to develop ways of avoiding taking down mainstream news content which contains excerpts of ISIS material, and this was an attempt to take advantage of that. In one case, an ISIS video was uploaded, but with 30 seconds of the France 24 news channel as an introduction before 49 minutes of the ISIS Iraq video. In another case, a remix of a BBC News jingle with a pop song that became popular during the Coronavirus outbreak was used to mask ISIS content. The researchers found that 70% of the ""Fuouaris Upload"" accounts were taken down during the nearly three-month period. But the network adapted and survived relatively easily by shifting from one account to another. As accounts were taken down, members of the network publicly mocked Facebook for not understanding the way they could operate on the platform. The followers and friends of the main Facebook accounts included supporters from a number of different language groups, including Albanian, Turkish, Somali, Ethiopian and Indonesian communities. The researchers say these accounts did not seem to be as heavily moderated as the Arabic and English ISIS accounts. On one Indonesian language account the researchers found a video, set in a kitchen, featuring a man in a balaclava explaining how to create explosives using household items. The video had been viewed 89 times and shared through 41 other Indonesian and Arabic language accounts, and flagged to Facebook. 'Inner workings' ""Our report is about the evasive behaviours of ISIS-supporting accounts on Facebook,"" the report's author Moustafa Ayad said. ""It is a deep dive into the inner workings of a singular terrorist-support network, connected to many others across the platform. ""The tactics we outline in our report are shifting as we speak. Without a clear understanding of these networks, and their behaviours, responses reliant on takedowns do little to quell ISIS-support expansion across our primary platforms."" ISD says Facebook's automated and manual detection systems need to be updated, with proactive investigations into repeat offending accounts and their connections to other accounts on the platform. It says the platform needs to re-examine account security protocols, and how these security measures are being actively subverted by users. In response to the research, a Facebook spokesperson said: ""We had already removed more than 250 accounts referenced in ISD's research prior to it being reported to us and have also removed the remaining 30 accounts. ""We have no tolerance for terrorist propaganda on our platform, and remove content and accounts that violate our policy as soon as we identify them.""","Facebook accounts linked to the Islamic State group (ISIS) are still finding ways to evade detection on the social media platform, a new report claims."
"The ride-hailing firms had threatened to suspend operations over an earlier ruling that they must classify drivers as employees, not contractors. But the reprieve allows them to continue operating while the court considers their case for appeal. The court's decision came just hours before Lyft was due to halt rides. The court has ordered Uber and Lyft to both submit their plans for hiring employees by early September, and oral arguments in the case are set for mid-October. Lyft was due to stop its services in California at 23:59 local time on Thursday (06:59 GMT on Friday). ""This is not something we wanted to do, as we know millions of Californians depend on Lyft for daily, essential trips,"" Lyft had said in a statement posted online. What happened? Both firms have always argued their drivers are self-employed contractors. But a California law that came into effect earlier this year, known as AB5, extended employee classification to workers in the ""gig economy"". The judge's ruling that the law applied to both Uber and Lyft means the firms need to provide drivers with extra benefits, such as unemployment protection. Both companies filed an appeal to the judgement - and asked for a stay on its enforcement while the courts dealt with the appeal. Unless the stay was granted, both companies had 10 days to undertake what they saw as a significant overhaul of their business in California. They both warned that they could be forced to pull services from the state at the end of the day on Thursday. What did the firms say? Lyft claims that four out of five of its drivers do not want to be classified as employees. Both argue that flexibility is valued by those who choose to work for them. The two firms had been emailing customers and sending app push notifications to try to drum up support for their side of the argument. Uber chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi, meanwhile, wrote an opinion piece for the New York Times, arguing that his firm was not truly against paying the costs of things like health insurance. Instead, he argued that the choice between being a full-time employee and a ""gig"" worker was a problem itself, and laws needed to be changed. He argued for a system where companies pay benefits based on a rate per hour worked. But he has also said that the company can only offer full jobs to a tiny fraction of its workforce. In a podcast interview with Vox Media, he summed up the problem as: ""We can't go out and hire 50,000 people overnight."" Lyft echoed that sentiment, telling the court that it ""cannot make the changes the injunction requires at the flip of a switch"". The companies do have some outside support. Some drivers do not want to be classed as employees, and the mayors of San Diego and San Jose - one Democrat and one Republican - joined forces to warn that shutting down the services ""virtually overnight"" would hurt one million residents in the state. What happens next? There is a potential way out for the ride-sharing firms in the coming months. A ballot that will be put to vote in November, at the same time as the US presidential election, would grant Uber and Lyft an exemption from the law. It is known as proposition 22. ""Your voice can help,"" Lyft wrote in its blog post about suspending services. ""Prop 22, proposes the necessary changes to give drivers benefits and flexibility, while maintaining the rideshare model that helps you get where you need to go,"" it said. Both companies, along with other supporters such as food delivery app DoorDash, are reported to have spent millions of dollars in lobbying and campaigning for the law. Labour groups, meanwhile, are set firmly against it, arguing it will save the companies vast sums of money at the expense of drivers.",Uber and Lyft have been granted a reprieve in a row over drivers' employment rights in California after a court granted an emergency injunction.
"By Zoe KleinmanTechnology reporter Police have confirmed that a body found in woodland near Ashford in Kent is that of the 33-year-old marketing executive. Metropolitan police commissioner Dame Cressida Dick has said it is ""thankfully incredibly rare"" for women to be abducted on the streets of London, but women around the country have shared experiences of facing fear or intimidation. Useful phone features shared include those already built into many smartphones and popular apps, such as shortcuts to emergency call access and temporary location-tracking services. Emergency call shortcuts On most smartphones, the unlock screen will include an emergency call button without the need to unlock the device. On some, pressing the on button and a volume key can also bring up a shortcut to 999. On an iPhone 8 or above, continuing to hold these buttons down will sound an alert and start a countdown from three, and if the buttons remain pressed the call will be made automatically. iPhone users can also say the number 14 to the voice assistant Siri, which will then ask whether you want to make an emergency call - although in some countries it will connect straightaway. Emergency contacts can be set up via the iPhone health app - and the people you choose will be notified if an emergency call is made. Google's safety app, available on its Pixel handsets, has a similar function. Samsung's emergency mode is designed to prolong battery life while keeping the phone on standby. It limits features and the home screen is displayed as black but it enables emergency calls, calls to an emergency contact, and location-sharing within a message using minimal power. Location-sharing There are a number of location tracker apps available to download, and they are popular - but not everybody wants to be tracked all the time. WhatsApp users can choose a contact, hit the attachment button to the right of the text box and select ""location"" - this will share the location of the device, only with the person they are messaging, for a certain period of time, ranging from 15 minutes to eight hours. On an Android phone, if the emergency location service is switched on (it's within settings, under the location tab), the device will automatically share its location with the emergency services during a call. An iPhone will automatically ping its location once the emergency call is finished, but this can be cancelled by the phone owner. 'Hey Siri, I'm being pulled over' This iPhone shortcut was not made by Apple itself and was first shared on Reddit in 2018 but has surged in popularity in the US since the protests over the death of George Floyd. It's designed for car drivers, it requires downloading, it only works on the operating system iOS 12 and above - and certain permissions will have to be activated first. There is no official equivalent for Android, although it is possible to create your own rules for the Google voice assistant. However, if you've jumped through those hoops, detailed here by The Verge, saying ""Hey Siri, I'm being pulled over"" will result in the phone screen dimming, pausing any music that's playing, activating do not disturb and starting a video recording through the front-facing camera. The handset will also send an automated message to a chosen emergency contact saying that the owner has been pulled over, and giving their location. In an interview with Business Insider, its creator Robert Peterson described it as ""the civilian equivalent"" to police-worn body cameras.",People in the UK have been sharing personal safety tips on social media following the death of Sarah Everard who disappeared as she walked home from a friend's house in south London last week.
"The error has caused a ""hiccup"" in the production of the eagerly-anticipated credit-card sized computer. The mistake meant that the wrong type of networking jack was soldered into place on some of the circuit boards. This might also have a knock-on effect and delay future production runs of the device. Jack shift Released in late February, the Raspberry Pi has been developed to be a cheap computer that will help children and other beginners get to grips with computer programming. The machine is available in two models. A model ""A"" without networking and a model ""B"" that comes with a network jack. However,Raspberry Pi announced on its blogthat some of the parts making up the first batch of the model Bs had been accidentally switched in the Chinese factory where they are being made. Production has been outsourced to China in a bid to keep costs of the bare-bones machine in check. The component in question is a specific type of ethernet jack or connector. Unfortunately, the factory soldered on the wrong type of jack which, if left in place, would leave the gadget unable to connect to a computer network. Sold out Swapping the wrong jacks for the right ones on the boards that were already made up was a ""minor problem to fix"", said Raspberry Pi. However, it added, there might be a delay for future gadgets as it sought sources of the correct component. Large stocks of the wrong component had been built up as production got going, it said, and these were now being swapped for the right ethernet jack. ""We are very, very sorry,"" wrote Raspberry Pi community manager Liz Upton on the organisation's blog. The bare-bones computer project has proved hugely popular and the websites of two of the firms contracted to build the machines crashed when the Pi went on general sale. All three firms that signed up to distribute the machine have sold their initial stock. Anyone wanting to buy one can now only register their interest rather than place an order and wait until more stock is received.","Manufacturing problems will mean the first batches of the £22 ($35) Raspberry Pi computer, aimed at helping people learn programming, are delayed."
"The ruling by a court in the Hague follows a complaint by the anti-piracy group Brein. It had said that the political party was helping users overcome a previous ruling that had ordered two of the country's biggest internet service providers to prohibit access to TPB. A subsequent order instructed a further five ISPs to block access to the site The rulings mark the latest action to prevent users from illegally sharing films, books, music and other copyrighted material via TPB's magnet links. At the end of April the UK also ordered several of its ISPs to prevent users from accessing the Swedish site. Proxies The court also upheld an order banning the Dutch Pirate Party from offering a proxy to let users obtain TPB's links without directly visiting the file-sharing site's pages. The original order had spurred on the Pirate Party to post suggestions for alternative ways to access TPB. A message posted on the Dutch Pirate Party's homepage described the most recent rulings as ""a slap in the face for the free internet"". ""The judge decided to give the Netherlands another nudge on the gliding scale of censorship,"" it said. ""More and more bits of the internet will have to be censored because they might be used to get access to 'infringing' sites, until eventually most of the internet will be unreachable."" UK workaround Brein could not be reached for comment and the organisation's website appeared to have been taken offline following the verdict. The UK's Pirate Party continues to offer a proxy-based workaround to TPB despite the High Court ordering five ISPs to prevent access to the site on 30 April. The party's campaigns officer, Andy Halsall, told the BBC that it had received two million hits to the service over a recent 24-hour period. The British Phonographic Industry (BPI) - which has pursued TPB in the UK - declined to comment about whether it planned to follow Brein's lead and take similar action against the local Pirate Party.",The Netherlands' Pirate Party has been ordered to stop publicising ways to circumvent blocks to The Pirate Bay.
"The 1.1 terabytes of data includes birthdates, home addresses, telephone numbers and political views of nearly 62% of the entire US population. The data was available on a publicly accessible Amazon cloud server. Anyone could access the data as long as they had a link to it. Political biases exposed The huge cache of data was discovered last week by Chris Vickery, a cyber-risk analyst with security firm UpGuard. The information seems to have been collected from a wide range of sources - from posts on controversial banned threads on the social network Reddit, to committees that raised funds for the Republican Party. The information was stored in spreadsheets uploaded to a server owned by Deep Root Analytics. It had last been updated in January when President Donald Trump was inaugurated and had been online for an unknown period of time. ""We take full responsibility for this situation. Based on the information we have gathered thus far, we do not believe that our systems have been hacked,"" Deep Root Analytics' founder Alex Lundry told technology website Gizmodo. ""Since this event has come to our attention, we have updated the access settings and put protocols in place to prevent further access."" Apart from personal details, the data also contained citizens' suspected religious affiliations, ethnicities and political biases, such as where they stood on controversial topics like gun control, the right to abortion and stem cell research. The file names and directories indicated that the data was meant to be used by influential Republican political organisations. The idea was to try to create a profile on as many voters as possible using all available data, so some of the fields in the spreadsheets were left left empty if an answer could not be found. ""That such an enormous national database could be created and hosted online, missing even the simplest of protections against the data being publicly accessible, is troubling,"" Dan O'Sullivan wrote in a blog post on Upguard's website. ""The ability to collect such information and store it insecurely further calls into question the responsibilities owed by private corporations and political campaigns to those citizens targeted by increasingly high-powered data analytics operations."" Privacy concerns Although it is known that political parties routinely gather data on voters, this is the largest breach of electoral data in the US to date and privacy experts are concerned about the sheer scale of the data gathered. ""This is deeply troubling. This is not just sensitive, it's intimate information, predictions about people's behaviour, opinions and beliefs that people have never decided to disclose to anyone,"" Privacy International's policy officer Frederike Kaltheuner told the BBC News website. However, the issue of data collection and using computer models to predict voter behaviour is not just limited to marketing firms - Privacy International says that the entire online advertising ecosystem operates in the same way. ""It is a threat to the way democracy works. The GOP [Republican Party] relied on publicly-collected, commercially-provided information. Nobody would have realised that the data they entrusted to one organisation would end up in a database used to target them politically. ""You should be in charge of what is happening to your data, who can use it and for what purposes,"" Ms Kaltheuner added. There are fears that leaked data can easily be used for nefarious purposes, from identity fraud to harassment of people under protection orders, or to intimidate people who hold an opposing political view. ""The potential for this type of data being made available publicly and on the dark web is extremely high,"" Paul Fletcher, a cyber-security evangelist at security firm Alert Logic told the BBC.",Sensitive personal details relating to almost 200 million US citizens have been accidentally exposed by a marketing firm contracted by the Republican National Committee.
"Apple has also filed a second case alleging Qualcomm had broken the terms of a deal covering how Apple could use technologies it had licensed. Qualcomm said it was ready to defend its business practices in court. The lawsuits come soon after US regulators sued Qualcomm, alleging that the firm was guilty of market abuse. In its legal papers, Apple said Qualcomm was using its dominant position as a supplier of communication chips for mobile phones to squeeze more cash from firms that use its technologies. In the second legal case, Apple said that Qualcomm had denied it access to chip technologies it was entitled to under the terms of an agreed licensing deal. In a statement, Qualcomm said it had not yet seen all the details of the two cases. ""These filings by Apple's Chinese subsidiary are just part of Apple's efforts to find ways to pay less for Qualcomm's technology,"" said Don Rosenberg, head lawyer for Qualcomm. He added that Apple was offered terms and conditions that were drawn up in 2015 following a ruling by Chinese trade regulators that dictated how Qualcomm should deal with companies keen to use its modem chips. More than 100 Chinese firms signed up to these terms and conditions, he said, adding that Apple ""refused to even consider them"". ""Qualcomm is prepared to defend its business model anywhere in the world,"" said Mr Rosenberg. Legal battles Last week, the US Federal Trade Commission sued Qualcomm claiming it had abused its dominance in modem chips for mobile phones. The FTC said Qualcomm's use of low licensing fees was helping it to enforce its monopoly. In response, Qualcomm said the FTC complaint was based on a ""flawed legal theory"" and ""significant misconceptions"" about the way the mobile industry worked. Soon after the FTC filed its complaint, Apple followed up with its own legal action seeking $1bn (£793m) in rebates and accusing Qualcomm of overcharging it for chips. Qualcomm said it planned to fight both legal cases. The chip-maker has been hit with legal challenges and regulatory action around the world over the last few years. In December 2016, South Korean regulators fined it 1.03trn won (£698m) for breaking competition laws. In 2015, it paid a $975m (£775m) fine in China following an anti-trust probe. The European Commission has also accused it of anti-competitive practices.","Apple has filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm in China seeking 1bn yuan (£115m) in damages, claiming the chip maker has abused its market position."
"The codes reveal what kind of airport checks a passenger will face and can be read by smartphones, he says. It could undermine the US's PreCheck system which randomly decides which frequent fliers can skip part of the pre-boarding security process. The barcodes could allow passengers to work out if they had been picked. Selected travellers are able to avoid having to remove their shoes, jackets and belts. In addition they are allowed to leave their laptops and toiletries in their bags. Unencrypted codes The security information on the barcodes is only meant to be decoded by Transportation Security Administration (TSA) officers, so it was not thought to be a problem that PreCheck selected which users would get a less rigorous safety check in advance. The fact that passengers can use their handsets to find out if they have been picked poses a problem, says Christopher Soghoian, principal technologist at the American Civil Liberties Union. ""The disclosure of this information means that bad guys are not going to be kept on their toes anymore,"" he said. The security issue was publicised by aviation blogger John Butler, but had been discussed in specialist online forums since last summer. ""The problem is, the passenger and flight information encoded in barcode is not encrypted in any way,"" wrote Mr Butler. ""Using a website I decoded my boarding pass for my upcoming trip. ""It's all there PNR [passenger name record], seat assignment, flight number, name, etc. But what is interesting is the bolded three on the end. This is the TSA PreCheck information. The number means the number of beeps. 1 beep no PreCheck, 3 beeps yes PreCheck."" The US Transportation Security Administration (TSA) did not respond to a BBC request for a statement, but has previously said: ""TSA does not comment on specifics of the screening process, which contain measures both seen and unseen. In addition, TSA incorporates random and unpredictable security measures throughout the travelling process."" Encryption issues Mr Soghoian told the BBC that information about how to make sense of the boarding pass codes had been documented in the International Air Transport Association's (IATA) implementation guide. ""Thousands of people have reported being able to get the information using their phones,"" he added. There are two ways to become eligible for the PreCheck system. Passengers can pay $100 (£62) to the US customs agency which then performs a background check. If the passenger is approved it gives him or her the right to use all of the US airlines' PreCheck systems for five years. Frequent fliers could also be invited by an airline to use the system for free. ""You have to be in the system first before they let you to potentially be eligible to skip the standard line,"" said Mr Soghoian. ""But if you scan the barcode, you can tell 24 hours before you get to the airport that you are not going to undergo a regular search. ""On some random occasion you'll be sent to the other line anyway - and it was meant to keep terrorists on their toes - but not anymore."" Security firm Sophos said the revelation was ""very worrying"". ""No one should be able to tell in advance what level of security screening they will be receive before an air flight,"" said the firm's senior technology consultant Graham Cluley. ""The risk is that potential attackers could determine in advance which of them is going to be given the weakest screening - and get them to attempt to carry unauthorised item onboard. ""Potential attackers should not be given advance warning of the security measures they will be facing.""","A vulnerability in US domestic airline boarding pass barcodes could allow travellers to bring unauthorised items on board, says a security expert."
"Texas-based Uniloc claims to own the patent that covers the way users are authorised to play via a phone. Mojang founder Markus Persson said he would ""throw piles of money"" into the legal fight against the claim. Mojang is one of ten companies, including Electronic Arts, GameLoft and Square Enix, that have been named in the lawsuit. The patent that Uniloc claims Mojang and others are using without permission describes a way to check that a person wanting to play a game has the right to do so. If not, that person is locked out of the game. In its court papers, Uniloc says the version of Minecraft for Android mobile phones violates its patented technology. Throughout the court papers, Uniloc misspells the name of the hugely popular game as ""Mindcraft"". Mr Persson announced that Mojang was being sued via his Twitter feed and in subsequent messages announced his intention to fight the claim. In one tweet, he criticised software patents in general, saying they were ""plain evil"". ""Innovation within software is basically free, and it's growing incredibly rapid,"" he said. ""Patents only slow it down. If needed, I will throw piles of money at making sure they don't get a cent.""

"By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor The kit - which is still a prototype - costs £1,000 and is being targeted at developers, rather than consumers, who must be over 18 years old. The BBC has learned that the US firm held talks with the Department for Transport ahead of the launch. The DfT had previously raised concerns that the wearable tech could prove a distraction to drivers. That is still the case, but a government spokesman revealed that the search firm was investigating ways to allow drivers to legally use Glass while on UK roads- possibly by restricting the information it displays mid-journey. ""Drivers must give their full attention to the road, which is why it has been illegal since the 1980s to view a screen whilst driving, unless that screen is displaying driving information,"" said the spokesman. ""There are no plans to change this and we have met with Google to discuss the implications of the current law for Google Glass. ""Google is anxious its products do not pose a road safety risk and is currently considering options to allow the technology to be used in accordance with the law."" A spokeswoman for Google confirmed the talks, adding that it urged buyers to use Glass safely. A video released by the firm to mark the London launch does, however, show the kit being used by a cyclist to get directions and check his pace. Other organisations, surveyed by the BBC, have raised separate concerns relating to Glass's ability to film video and take photographs: Upgraded hardware Google first announced Glass in April 2012. It was initially limited to US-based developers, but was put on general release in the country in May, at a cost of $1,500 (£881). The kit features a transparent display that creates the illusion of a 25in (63.5cm) screen floating about 8ft (2.4m) in front of the wearer's right eye, which can be used to display information from apps. A built-in camera and microphone can record photos, video and sounds, while the machine can play back audio by sending vibrations through the wearer's skull using a bone conduction transducer, or via more traditional headphones. Google pitches Glass as a hands-free, quick-to-use alternative to smartphones. ""We believe it's really to keep you engaged and present in the moment while having access to those things that are digitally available to you,"" Ivy Ross, head of the Glass division told the BBC. She added that the eyewear had already gone through five hardware revisions and 12 software updates before its UK launch, and that Google planned further revisions before targeting Glass at consumers. Many expect that will be accompanied by a price cut. ""To some extent, Google is using the current price to manage take-up, so that the only people buying it have strong reasons to do so - for example building apps,"" said Ian Fogg from the IHS Technology consultancy. ""The cost of the components involved in the current model is about $152. ""Clearly there are other costs involved in bringing it to market, but Google could create a much more compelling price if it chooses to."" Glass guidelines Many of the UK organisations surveyed by the BBC are taking a wait-and-see approach before deciding whether to introduce rules to govern use of the kit. Ulster Hospital highlighted its no-photography rule, but added ""it is obviously an area we will have to consider in the future"". Andrew Lloyd Webber's Really Useful Group- which runs six theatres in London - said it planned to ""evaluate the implications of this new technology, especially with regard to the effect on the cast, creative team and members of the public"", while the JD Wetherspoon chain of pubs said it planned to ""discuss the matter in due course"". Other firms appeared more relaxed. British Airways said its customers could wear Glass at any time on board its aircraft, as long as they put it in flight safety mode when necessary. Tesco said it had already developed a concept Glass app that could be used in its stores. And Waterstones added: ""As a bookshop it is difficult to see how Google Glass eyewear could cause us or our customers any difficulty beyond, of course, some mild ridicule."" A spokeswoman for Google noted that Glass lights up when it captures images, and that its battery limits it to taking a maximum of 45 minutes of video at a time.","Google has released Glass in the UK, making it the second country to get the Android-powered eyewear after the US."
"The website Down Detector reported that thousands of people globally had complained about the Facebook-owned trio being down from 11.30 BST onwards. Facebook users were presented with the message: ""Something went wrong."" At 14:50, the site said it had resolved the issue after some users ""experienced trouble connecting"" to the apps. A spokesman for the company added: ""We're sorry for any inconvenience."" Facebook did not comment on the cause of the problem, or say how many users had been affected. In March, Facebook experienced one of its longest ever outages, with some users around the globe unable to access its site, as well as Instagram and WhatsApp, for more than 24 hours.","Social networks Facebook and Instagram, as well as messaging service WhatsApp, were unavailable on Sunday for more than three hours, users said."
"The drone - dubbed Aquila - flew for one hour and 46 minutes in Arizona. On Aquila's maiden voyage last summer, the autopilot system was confused by heavy wind and crash-landed. This time, the drone flew at an altitude of 3,000ft, a long way from Facebook's intended 60,000ft goal. The social network has ambitious plans for its drone fleet and eventually wants to have them communicating with each other via lasers and staying in the air for months at a time. The test - which took place in May but is only now being made public - went ""perfectly"", according to a blog post detailing the flight. Facebook had initially heralded its June 2016 test a success but later admitted the drone had crashed on landing. The crash was only revealed when it emerged that it had been investigated by the National Transportation Safety Board. This time, the engineering team added ""spoilers"" to the wings to increase drag and reduce lift during landing. They also modified the autopilot software and applied a smoother finish to the craft. The team filmed the landing and included the video in the blog post. Director of aeronautical platforms Martin Luis Gomez said the drone had suffered ""a few minor, easily repairable dings"". Aquila - which has a wingspan of a Boeing 737 - is part of Facebook's ambitious plans to connect the world to the internet. This week, it announced that it has two billion users, more than a quarter of the world's population.",Facebook has completed a second test of a solar-powered drone designed to bring internet access to remote parts of the world.
"Toy maker Mattel is partnering with US start-up ToyTalk to develop Hello Barbie, which will have two-way conversations with children. The Barbie will use a speech-recognition platform developed by ToyTalk. A prototype of the doll was at the New York Toy Fair on 14 February, where a glut of smart toys were on display. ""The number one request we hear from girls around the world is that they want to have a conversation with Barbie. Now, for the first time ever, Barbie can have a two-way conversation,"" said a spokeswoman for Mattel. The Hello Barbie will be able to play interactive games and tell stories and jokes. It will also listen to the child's conversation and adapt to it over time - so, for instance, if a child mentions that they like to dance, the doll may refer to this in a future chat. The doll requires a wi-fi connection and can provide an hour's worth of playtime when fully charged. A microphone, speaker and two tricolour LEDs will be embedded in the doll's necklace, while rechargeable batteries in its legs can be connected to an external wall-mounted charger. The doll is expected to sell for about $74.99 (£49). No release date has yet been confirmed. Doll hack Increasingly, the toy market is becoming saturated with smart versions of old favourites. Back in November, the Vivid Toy group released Cayla, a doll that uses speech-recognition and Google's translation tools. In January, security researcher Ken Munro discovered a vulnerability in its software, which allowed for it to be hacked to say things that might not be suitable for children. A start-up, now live on Kickstarter, is developing a line of smart toys powered by the IBM-developed supercomputer Watson. The first range from Elemental Path will be a smart dinosaur that can chat with children, tell them jokes and answer a range of questions. ""Toys have to keep up with the expectations of children,"" said Natasha Crookes, director of communications for the British Toy and Hobby Association. ""As long as children are protected from being able to access anything online, there is no harm in internet-connected toys. ""Companies take a lot of care making sure that there are white lists and black lists for content."" Some critics have questioned whether internet-connected toys endanger traditional, imaginative play, but Ms Crookes is not convinced. ""Such toys can enhance traditional play,"" she says. ""Some of the time, children will play with the toy in internet-connected mode, and some of the time they will play with them in the traditional way, using their imagination,"" she said.","Barbie is having a digital makeover, with the release of an internet-connected version of the iconic doll."
"So-called ""fully-loaded Kodi boxes"" have gained popularity, but the legality of their sale is in question. Middlesbrough trader Brian Thompson appeared in court, accused of selling equipment that ""facilitated the circumvention"" of copyright protection measures. He pleaded not guilty to three charges. The trial has been described as a landmark case by industry watchers. Mr Thompson will next appear at Teesside Crown Court on 27 October. What is Kodi? Kodi is free software designed to bring videos, music, games and photographs together in one easy-to-use application. It began life as a program called Xbox Media Centre (XBMC) that added a feature-rich media player to the original Xbox games console. The open-source project was developed by volunteers and can now be installed on a variety of devices including smartphones and computers. It can also be loaded on to television-connected devices such as the Amazon Fire stick or Apple TV box, although it is not supported by those manufacturers. What are Kodi boxes? Some shops sell ready-to-use set-top boxes or television sticks preloaded with the Kodi software. They are also known as Android boxes, because many of the devices run Android as their primary operating system. The developers behind Kodi say their software does not contain any content of its own and is designed to play legally owned media or content ""freely available"" on the internet. However, the software can be modified with third-party add-ons that provide access to pirated copies of films and TV series, or provide free access to subscription television channels. Some traders sell Kodi boxes preloaded with such third-party add-ons that can access pirated content. It is the sale of these ""fully-loaded"" boxes that is the subject of a legal case. What do the makers of Kodi say? The developers behind Kodi have said they do not support ""piracy add-ons"" and have criticised those who advertise ""fully-loaded"" set-top boxes for sale. The group said it would maintain a ""neutral stance on what users do with their own software"", but would battle those using the Kodi trademark to sell a ""fully-loaded Kodi box"". Discussions about ""pirated content"" and add-ons that provide access are removed from its message board.",A legal case concerning the sale of video-streaming set-top boxes that can access subscription content for free began on Tuesday.
"Xiaomi, which specialises in low-cost smartphones, has ambitions to sell 100,000 handsets in India every week. But the country's air force warned its personnel against using the devices, citing security concerns about data being kept in Beijing. Xiaomi said it never collected user data without permission. The company has already begun the process of moving non-Chinese data out of Beijing, and instead into data centres owned by Amazon. The decision to open a facility in India is another move by Xiaomi to allay privacy fears. Concerns over how data is held by the firm are seen as perhaps the only significant barrier to its rapid expansion around the world. The company, which poached a high-profile Google executive to spearhead Western efforts, has produced feature-rich smartphones that are considerably cheaper than some rivals. Less favourable is Xiaomi's reputation as a copycat brand. When Apple executive Jony Ive was asked for his thoughts on the company, he said: ""I don't see it as flattery, I see it as theft.""","After India warned its military not to use Xiaomi devices owing to privacy fears, the Chinese firm has announced plans to open an Indian data centre."
"It has revised the list of rates that Openreach, which manages BT's network, can charge other providers for using its services. In some cases, the wholesale price could fall by more than 10% per year. The move could benefit companies such as TalkTalk and Sky, but not Virgin Media which uses its own cable network. Under Ofcom's proposals the prices of two of the ways that BT's rivals get access to its network will come down. The first, called Local Loop Unbundling, allows telecoms firms to site their equipment in BT exchanges and take over lines to customers. Ofcom wants the price Openreach charges when an operator takes over these lines completely to drop by between 1.2 and 4.2% every year. Where lines are shared it wants prices to drop by between 11.6 and 14.6% every year. To illustrate the potential numbers affected, Ofcom said there were about 7.6 million unbundled lines in the UK. The second, called Wholesale Line Rental, involves telecoms firms simply renting lines from Openreach. Ofcom wants the prices of these to drop by between 3.1 and 6.1% every year. There are about 6.14 million WLR lines in the UK. The price changes are to be applied after taking inflation into account. This might mean that some prices creep upwards if inflation rises. ""Ofcom expects its proposed prices to lead to real term price reductions for consumers, as communications providers pass on savings to their landline and broadband customers,"" it said in a statement. In response, BT released a statement which said: ""BT invests more than any other company in the UK's communications infrastructure, so it is critical that it is able to achieve a fair rate of return in order to continue its investment in copper and fibre-based services."" It added: ""Upon initial review, we are encouraged by Ofcom's recognition of this fact, but would question some of the underlying assumptions being used."" The communications watchdog said its proposals were the start of a consultation process that would end on 9 June. BT said it would raise its concerns with Ofcom during the consultation process. The conclusions of the consultation will be published in the autumn. Any price changes that result would come into effect towards the end of 2011 and be in place until March 2014.",The cost of home telephone and broadband services could come down after telecoms regulator Ofcom moved to reduce the wholesale price.
"Dave LeeNorth America technology reporter Not only do you get an exciting virtual reality experience, but Daydream also gives off enough heat to keep your house warm throughout the winter. Devices get hot, I get that, but the Pixel XL smartphone running a full throttle VR experience is something else all together - the McDonald's apple pie of gadgetry, strapped to your face. It's a reminder, I think, of the strain we're putting our devices under to deliver the kind of experiences we demand in mobile computing. And there is also a sense that when it comes to smartphone-powered VR, we've still got some way to go before the hardware can truly match our expectations. As I found from playing around with Daydream this past week, small sacrifices mean it falls short of the immersive future promised by Google boss Sundar Pichai. VR land grab Daydream, first announced by Mr Pichai in May, goes on sale on Thursday. The product is pretty simple: a pair of lenses housed in fabric-covered plastic, which comes with a smart little remote control that you'll use to control various aspects of your VR experience. To get it to do anything, you'll need to add a crucial component - a smartphone. In this case, I was using Google's new Pixel XL, but the plan is for Daydream to support a wide range of phones that may or may not be made by Google. It's worth stressing that Daydream isn't designed to compete with the high-end virtual reality hardware we've seen hit the market this year. Instead, the intention is to act as a sort of gateway drug to virtual reality - an experience that is ""good enough"" without breaking the bank. Daydream is competing with Gear VR, a collaboration between Samsung and Facebook-owned Oculus that works on the same principle: you slot your phone into a cheap-ish empty headset, but with Gear VR it must be a Samsung device. This race is so important for Google and Facebook as they are both utterly desperate to get ahead in the major new marketplace of flogging virtual reality apps and content. Gear VR has a head start. You can already check out live sport such as NBA matches and settle in for virtual big-screen Netflix viewing, which is oddly enjoyable. It's early days for Daydream, but there are promising signs that good content is on its way, mostly thanks to services that Google already owns such as Street View and YouTube. The latter's 360-degree video offerings lack any actual interactivity, but do provide some breathtaking visuals without having to wait too long for content to download. Fabricated One of Google's goals with Daydream is to make something that doesn't look and feel overwhelmingly nerdy. The headset is covered in a nice, light fabric that at least on the surface looks more comfortable than Samsung's plasticky Gear VR. But once you put it on, you immediately notice Daydream's significant design flaws - problems that don't seem to have been created by hardware limitations but simply by bad decisions. I'll start with the most serious. When you fire it up, chances are Daydream will be out of focus. Blurry images in VR are a terrible thing - it increases the already high risk of feeling disorientated or nauseous. On Gear VR, there's a focus dial on top of the device that gives you a few millimetres of adjustment space to sharpen things up. But on Daydream there is nothing of the sort - you're instead required to shift the device around your forehead until you get something that works with your eyes. The resulting position, in my case, wasn't as comfortable as it should have been. Daydream's rigid shape seems to ignore that peoples faces aren't all the same. For me, the headset didn't sit snugly over my nose, which meant a line of natural light crept up through the bottom at all times. Flaws like this ruin the VR effect of being transported to a different world. The illusion never has a chance to take hold. This problem is made worse by Daydream's limited field of view. You never get away from the feeling that you're viewing this virtual world through a small, restrictive circle. That potential world is made smaller still due to Daydream's solid back. With Gear VR, the phone's rear camera can be turned on to offer a sort of augmented reality that lets you look out into the real world while keeping the headset on. But with Daydream, the phone is tucked into a little pouch, blocking the ability for the rear camera to see anything. And as I mentioned, the Pixel XL gets extremely hot. Wear it long enough and you'll really start to feel the heat, though Daydream doesn't fog up in the same way Gear VR does - a major plus there. Tilt and roll Where Google has got it very right is with its little controller. You use it to interact with everything in Daydream, and it's a terrific bit of hardware that is instantly intuitive and delightfully flexible. In WonderGlade, a game that plonks you in a cartoon theme park, the controller is used to full effect. In one section, it's used to control a game of tilt and roll. In the next mini-game, it changes into a magic wand, then a fire hose, and then a putter. It has a tendency to disconnect every now and then, which is a real frustration, but the amount of interaction it offers gives Daydream a big selling point over Gear VR, and even some of the high-end headsets. People who want to use VR for gaming will naturally still want a wireless gaming controller. But for the vast majority of uses, the simple remote nails it. Flawed but in front I had higher hopes for Daydream when it was first announced in May. And I find it irritating that minor things, such as the focus adjuster, are missing and would have made a big difference. But Google's strategy to make Daydream the entry level headset that supports a wide range of smartphones gives it an undeniable advantage over its rival. We're still lacking a real killer VR app, and Daydream is already attracting bad ideas such as the Wall Street Journal's app, which mostly lets you read text and look at market data in VR - the most pointless adoption of technology since my grandmother used a tablet computer as a coaster. But there are signals that truly groundbreaking applications will come in time. The Guardian's Daydream app, for example, places you in a tiny cell in a US jail, a feeling of solitary confinement that no amount of written words could possibly emulate. For most people, VR won't be something they discover via the high-end PC gaming set-ups required for the top experiences today. It'll be this cheap and cheerful option instead. Right now the technology isn't quite there, but it's getting closer - and with Daydream, Google has gained an early advantage.

"By James ClaytonNorth America technology reporter Thomas Moyer is accused of offering bribes in the form of iPads worth $70,000 in order to obtain concealed firearms licenses. The charges were brought by a California grand jury on Monday. Apple did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Two police officers from Santa Clara County, California, have also been charged. County Undersheriff Rick Sung and Sheriff's Captain James Jenson are accused of requesting bribes for concealed firearms licenses. Mr Moyer is accused of offering bribes to get them. Under state law, it is a crime to carry a concealed firearm without a concealed weapon license. Santa Clara County alleges that Mr Sung held back issuing concealed weapons permits to Apple's security team, until Mr Moyer agreed to donate $70,000 worth of iPads to the sheriff's office. Plan foiled The charge sheet states that the plan was scuttled at the eleventh hour in August, 2019, when Mr Sung and Mr Moyer learned of a search warrant to seize the police's concealed weapon license records. The two-year investigation concludes that Mr Sung, aided by Mr Jensen in one instance, would hold back on issuing permits, refusing to release them until the applicants gave something of value. If found guilty those charged could face prison time. Santa Clara County District Attorney Jeff Rosen said: ""Call this quid pro quo. Call it pay-to-play. Call it give to get. It is illegal and deeply erodes public confidence in the criminal justice system,"" ""When high-ranking members of a law enforcement agency are at the heart of a bribery scheme, it tarnishes the badge, the honour, the reputations and - tragically - the effectiveness of all law enforcement agencies.""

"The Magic Leap One Creator Edition is designed to project light directly into users' eyes to trick their brains into perceiving virtual objects as part of their surrounding environment. It consists of a large pair of goggles that wrap around the head, a body-worn computer and a wireless controller. The firm has raised close to $1.9bn (£1.4bn) from investors. The Florida-based company's biggest backers include Google, the Chinese tech giant Alibaba and the Singaporean sovereign wealth fund Temasek. Despite teasing its technology for several years via YouTube videos and demonstrations to selected members of the press and analysts, it had kept close guard over what form its product would take. Some critics had doubted the computing power required to create ""lightfield"" objects in real-time could be shrunk down to a small enough size to make it practical in the near-term. That had fuelled speculation that it might never deliver on its promise. Magic Leap suggests its approach is more comfortable to use for extended periods of time than other attempts to create mixed reality. The product unveiled is promised for release in 2018 and is being pitched, at this point, to developers and other ""creatives"". The company has yet to show off a promised ""next generation"" user interface and has said it reserves the right to change the design of its kit before it is delivered. It will compete for attention against Microsoft's Hololens headset, which similarly has yet to be given a launch date for the general public. Rolling Stone magazine was given a demo of the Magic Leap One Creator Edition ahead of the reveal. It said the graphics produced only partially covered the user's view - a similar issue faced by Hololens. ""I couldn't' measure it, so I did the next best thing: I spent a few minutes holding out first a credit card in front of my face and then my hands to try to be able to describe how big that invisible frame is,"" wrote reporter Brian Crecente. ""The credit card was much too small. I ended up with this: The viewing space is about the size of a VHS tape held in front of you with your arms half extended. It's much larger than the HoloLens, but it's still there."" He added that Magic Leap has suggested developers fade the edges of their images to help tackle the problem. Analysis: Dave Lee, North America technology reporter One of the biggest questions facing Magic Leap was whether its creators could realistically make a machine powerful enough to deliver what it had promised - in a way that didn't mean strapping a supercomputer to your back. Now we know what the first version will look like: enormous super-nerd goggles with an accompanying colostomy bag. I'm teasing - if they've managed to pack the computing power needed into a machine that size, Magic Leap is already something of a triumph. But we of course must reserve judgment until people have tried it for real. In the past, on-stage demos of Microsoft's competing augmented reality device Hololens have suggested a world far more immersive and impressive than what the device can actually produce. I find it hard to believe that Magic Leap is yet as good as the jaw-dropping promo videos would have you believe - but I'd love to be proved wrong.",Magic Leap has unveiled the first version of its augmented reality system to be made public.
"Y Internet allegedly provided unauthorised online subscription services for pay-TV channels. The investigation was initiated by the Premier League as part of a crackdown on illegal redistribution of its live football broadcasts. The ISP has not responded to requests for comment. According to police, the ISP, which was based in Malaga, allegedly sold subscriptions to pubs, hotels and individuals on the Costa del Sol. No-one was arrested in the raid, which happened in September, but equipment was seized and the investigation remains ongoing, according to the police. Two individuals believed to have run the ISP from the UK had been charged with ""intellectual property-related offences"", the BBC was told, but their names have not been released. Fans' enjoyment Premier League director of legal services Kevin Plumb said: ""The raids conducted by the Spanish authorities... are a positive example of law enforcement taking piracy and IP infringement seriously. ""This approach is essential for organisations like the Premier League - and other creative industries - as our model is predicated on the ability to market and sell rights and protect intellectual property. ""It is because of this that clubs can invest in star players and managers, and world class stadiums - the very things fans enjoy about our competition."" The Spanish raid follows a recent case in the UK where an individual who supplied IPTV devices that showed Premier League football matches illegally was sent to prison for four years.",Police in Spain have released details about a raid on an internet service provider suspected of hosting an illegal TV streaming business.
"By Zoe KleinmanTechnology reporter, BBC News In theory Facebook could be fined if it is found to be in breach of GDPR, Europe's data protection rules. It has not revealed whether other services which people use their Facebook log-ins for - such as Tinder and Spotify - have also been affected. Facebook has now fixed the issue. People potentially affected were logged out of their accounts on Friday and those definitely affected were notified. Facebook says it has identified 50 million accounts which were certainly involved in the breach, with an extra 40 million also warned as a precautionary measure. The Irish Data Protection Commission says less than 10% of the 50 million are believed to be European accounts. It is also unknown whether networks of friends were also affected, as their data would have been visible to anyone with access to an individual's account. Will Facebook be fined? The Wall Street Journal reports that Facebook could face a fine of up to $1.63bn (£1.25bn) - 4% of its annual global turnover - which is the absolute maximum that could be imposed by the Irish Data Protection Commissioner if the firm is found to be in breach of Europe's GDPR privacy legislation. As Facebook Europe is based in Ireland, this is the authority it will deal with. There are rules regarding the reporting of such a breach and so far Facebook has stuck to them. An information breach is supposed to be reported within 72 hours of discovery and this is what Facebook appears to have done - it says it discovered the breach on Tuesday, notified the commissioner on Thursday and alerted the public on Friday after fixing the vulnerability. The Information Commissioner says it recognises that firms may not have all the answers regarding an incident within 72 hours, and that information can be shared as it is discovered - and Facebook has admitted it is ""at the very start"" of its investigation. Data protection adviser Jon Baines from the law firm Mishcon de Reya LLP told the BBC it was impossible to know how likely a fine is at this early stage. ""No matter how good an organisation's response is to a personal data breach, it is what went before that will count against it,"" he said. ""So, if Facebook is found not to have taken sufficiently robust measures [to prevent the vulnerability], it may be held to have infringed GDPR, even if its response since has been exemplary."" Could it face legal action from its two billion members? A class action lawsuit has already been filed in California by two Facebook users who claim the firm was negligent in allowing accounts to be compromised, reports Bloomberg. The action represents all Facebook users in the US, the paperwork says. It accuses Facebook of a ""continuing and absolute disregard"" in its treatment of account holders' personal information. Who did it? Facebook said it doesn't know who was behind the attacks or where they are based. It also said it doesn't know what - if any - personal information was accessed. However it did acknowledge that the weakness in its code dates back to a change that was made in July 2017, meaning the accounts were vulnerable from that time. While it was quite a complex process, it has been reported that there were videos on YouTube explaining how to hack the platform. Are other platforms affected? The BBC has asked Spotify and Tinder, both of which can be accessed via a Facebook log-in, whether their services have been affected as a result of the breach. ""It appears it could very well affect other platforms if you have used Facebook as your means of logging in,"" said prof Alan Woodward, a cyber-security expert from Surrey University. ""Some password managers have been issuing warnings today to go change your passwords for that very reason."" Prof Woodward advised creating individual log-ins for each service.","Following the revelation that up to 50 million Facebook accounts may have been accessed in an attack due to a weakness in the platform's code, many questions remain about the breach."
"Joe TidyCyber-security reporter It is the first competitive event since last month's inaugural World Cup in New York, which had a record-breaking $30m (£24m) prize purse. Many of the newly-made millionaire stars of the World Cup will be taking part in the multiplayer shooting and building game. One man who will be just as busy and nervous is Hugh Gilmour, even though he will not be touching a controller for the entire competition. The 19-year-old, whose online name is Destiny, is arguably the world's most successful Fortnite coach. He mentored the top three finishers in the solo competition in New York. The list includes 16-year-old Kyle ""Bugha"" Giersdorf, who won the title and is now $3m richer. And Hugh also helped the top three teams to success in the doubles event. No bonuses Even though he helped coach the winners, who received huge prizes, he himself has not become rich - only charging his clients a fixed fee of £120 with no percentage of winnings. However, Hugh has no regrets over the situation. ""I only turned from player to coach full-time in July, so I used the World Cup as an entrance event and it was an incredible moment for me,"" he told the BBC. ""I was at home watching the matches so closely, and even though it was my players who were making all that money, I was thinking 'this is great for me too',"" he added. From failed player to successful coach Hugh lives with his parents in Kent, England and was a competitive player himself, until he decided to make the switch after failing to qualify for the World Cup. ""I got into Fortnite when it went really big in March 2018. I was working at a gym and I started playing to a high standard, then casually helping others with tactics and tips,"" he said. ""Once I went into coaching, I told everyone in my Fortnite community that I was available. It went from there."" Hugh's coaching is all done through video chat on the gaming platform Discord. Although he also helps with the mental preparation, the bulk of his time and effort goes into analysing matches and developing tactics. The battle royale style of Fortnite involves 100 players being dropped on to an ever-shrinking island, where they have to race to get weapons and materials to help them survive to the end. The last player standing wins. Tactics Developing tactics for the first few minutes of each match is crucial to victory. Hugh says he spent eight hours a day on each of the 11 days leading up to the World Cup, collecting data and intelligence for his players on their opponents' likely movements. Hugh said: ""A lot of people look at Fortnite and think it is a cartoony video game made for kids, but it's actually really complex and deep. ""It's an intense game with mechanical work, target practice and looting. There's so much going on, you have to have a good early game set-up with items and building materials. ""That's where a lot of my work goes. I watched back dozens and dozens of matches to find out which of my players' rivals are likely to get in the way of a good early game set-up. ""You don't want to bump into a decent player early on, or get to a loot spot too late to get the weapons."" Hugh Gilmour's top five Fortnite tips Hugh showed the BBC a route map that he made for Bugha, the winner of the World Cup. It shows the 16-year-old's preferred landing spot and route in the first few minutes of an average match and compares his plans with those of his opponents. Using this and other player statistics and behaviours, Hugh was able to make plans and contingencies for how to beat certain players. He also developed specific techniques for how players could, for example, defend themselves in certain exposed areas on the map. Hugh also helped British 15-year-old Jaden ""Wolfieiz"" Ashman and his partner Dave ""Rojo"" Jong to their eventual silver medal and $2.25m winnings in the doubles competition. Rojo says the coaching was invaluable: ""Knowing where other people were dropping and fine-tuning our own drop with rotation was so important. ""We made a few mistakes that got fixed before the tournament thanks to Destiny pointing them out. ""We would have most likely made those mistakes at the World Cup and not got second place."" Rojo, like many Fornite professionals, says that coaching is now a big part of e-sports. ""Coaching is, in my opinion, already one of the most important things in e-sports. Whether it be video analytics, tactics or mental coaching, it releases the weight from players' shoulders so they can focus on their own game."" Coaching in e-sports is already well established in older games like League of Legends or Fifa. According to the British Esports Association, teams pay about £26,000 for a full-time coach, often with a share of the winnings as well.","Gamers around the world are preparing for the Fortnite Champions Series, which starts on Saturday."
"Speaking at the Casual Connect game conference in Seattle, Gabe Newell said the next version of Windows could mean big changes to the PC market. Many took his comment as a criticism of the changed user interface in Windows 8 as well as its built-in Windows Store. The Windows Store could dent the success of Valve's own online market, Steam, through which players buy games. Hat tricks Mr Newell, who worked for Microsoft for 13 years on Windows, said his company had embraced the open-source software Linux as a ""hedging strategy"" designed to offset some of the damage Windows 8 was likely to do. ""We want to make it as easy as possible for the 2,500 games on Steam to run on Linux as well,"" said Mr Newell. ""Windows 8 is a catastrophe for everyone in the PC space."" The arrival of Windows 8 would be likely to drive some PC makers and others out of the business because it put so much pressure on their sales margins, Mr Newell added. He said the success of Valve, known for its Half Life, Left4Dead and Portal titles, had been down to the open nature of the PC. ""We've been a free rider, and we've been able to benefit from everything that went into PCs and the internet,"" he told the conference. ""And we have to continue to figure out how there will be open platforms."" However, he added, the openness that helped Valve as well as firms such as Google and Zynga could disappear with Windows 8. ""There's a strong temptation to close the platform,"" he said, ""because they look at what they can accomplish when they limit the competitors' access to the platform, and they say, 'That's really exciting.'"" This is seen by commentators to be a reference to the inclusion of a Windows Store in the Microsoft operating system. This is a shop through which users will be able to buy apps for their Windows 8 device. On versions of Windows 8 designed to run on ARM-based chips, it will be the only way to get downloadable software such as games. Microsoft takes a cut, up to 30%, of every sale made through this store, similar to that taken by Apple, Google and others on existing mobile app markets. This could be a significant threat to the massively successful Steam online game store that Valve runs and which gives it a commission on every title sold through the online market. A Windows Store closed to everyone but Microsoft might reduce the range of games available for sale through Steam. Windows 8's links with Microsoft's Xbox Live online game service could also dent the appeal of Steam for many people. Mr Newell said Valve was preparing for the future in other ways. In particular, he said, it was trying to make tools and services that players could use to make games and gaming more fun for everyone. ""We think the future is very different [from] successes we've had in the past,"" he said. ""When you are playing a game, you are trying to think about creating value for other players, so the line between content player and creator is really fuzzy."" One harbinger of this future was perhaps found, he said, in the success of one Team Fortress player in Kansas who was earning $150,000 (£97,000) a year making virtual hats. ""This isn't about video games,"" he said. ""It's about thinking about goods and services in a digital world.""","Operating system Windows 8 will be a ""catastrophe"" for PC game makers, according to Valve Software's boss."
"By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor The social network said that about 0.5% of the 305,000 people who installed a personal data-harvesting app had given permission for it to access their Facebook inboxes. However, many more would have been affected as the haul would have included conversations with others. It is not clear whether the messages were given to Cambridge Analytica. The political consultancy has yet to comment on the latest development. ""Prior to 2015, Facebook's platform policy allowed developers to request permission to access inbox content but only if the person explicitly gave consent for this to happen,"" a spokeswoman for the US tech firm told the BBC. ""According to our records, only a very small number of people - approximately 1,500 - explicitly opted into sharing this information with Kogan's app. The feature was turned off in 2015."" On Monday, Cambridge Analytica issued a fresh statement, restating that it had licensed ""legally obtained"" data from Global Science Research director Aleksandr Kogan, adding that ""hundreds of data firms have utilised Facebook data in a similar fashion"". Warning notices The latest revelation emerged after Facebook began sending notices to users it had indentified as being among the 87 million people whose data had been potentially shared with Cambridge Analytica. That figure includes both those who took Mr Kogan's test as well as their friends, whose personal records the app also had access to. Cambridge Analytica has said it only obtained data on about 30 million US citizens. Facebook's alerts included the warning: ""A small number of people who logged into This Is Your Digital Life also shared their own... messages from you."" Carole Cadwalladr - the Observer journalist whose investigation helped plunge Facebook into the current crisis - was among the first to pick up on the implication. The BBC understands that Facebook does not believe that any of the 1,500 users involved had also given access to their SMS texts, despite the fact that there used to be ways to group all one's messages together in one place. The latest revelation came hours before Facebook's chief executive Mark Zuckerberg was due to testify before the US Senate Commerce and Judiciary committees in Washington. He is also due to be questioned by the House Congressional Testimony on Wednesday. Ahead of his appearance, Facebook announced it would begin paying bounties to those who reported misuses of members' data by app developers. ""This programme will reward people with first-hand knowledge and proof of cases where a Facebook platform app collects and transfers people's data to another party to be sold, stolen or used for scams or political influence,"" it said.",Facebook has confirmed that private messages were included in data involved in the Cambridge Analytica scandal.
"By Zoe KleinmanTechnology reporter, BBC News The valve connects patients in intensive care to breathing machines. The hospital, in Brescia, had 250 coronavirus patients in intensive care and the valves are designed to be used for a maximum of eight hours at a time. The 3D-printed version cost less than €1 (90p) each to produce and the prototype took three hours to design. Italian journalist Nunzia Vallini put the hospital in touch with Isinnova chief executive Cristian Fracassi after discovering the original supplier was unable to supply new valves quickly. He and mechanical engineer Alessandro Romaioli raced there to see the valve for themselves - and three hours later, returned with a prototype. ""They tested it on a patient and they told us that it worked well and so we ran again back to our office and we started to print new valves,"" Mr Romaioli told BBC News. The pair then joined forces with Lonati, another local 3D-printer company to meet the demand, since Isinnova has six printers and the devices take about an hour each to print. They are working for free, but they do not plan to release the design publicly. ""The valve has very thin holes and tubes, smaller than 0.8m - it's not easy to print the pieces,"" Mr Fracassi said. ""Plus you have to respect not [contaminating] the product - really it should be produced in a clinical way."" Nevertheless, a second hospital had now got in touch, requesting more valves. ""We haven't slept for two days,"" he said. ""We're trying to save lives.""",A 3D-printer company in Italy has designed and printed 100 life-saving respirator valves in 24 hours for a hospital that had run out of them.
"In a similar way to Apple's iPhone 5, the main button on the front of the device doubles as a fingerprint scanner used to unlock the device. The S5, which is water and dust-resistant will be available in April. South Korea-based Samsung, the market leader in smartphone sales worldwide, also claimed to have made the ""world's fastest"" auto-focusing camera. In addition to two smartwatches announced on Sunday - the Gear and Gear 2 Neo - Samsung also added the Gear Fit, a smartband that is focused on fitness. Security focus Security has been a major theme at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. Earlier on Monday, the Blackphone, made by Silent Circle, was launched. It included a range of specialised security apps offering encrypted communication. And for Samsung, it was security features that provoked applause from those in attendance at its characteristically-flamboyant launch event at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. As well as unlocking the device, the fingerprint scanner will be used to power payments. Samsung has partnered with Paypal to offer payment-by-finger. The scanner is also able to enable ""private mode"", a way of storing sensitive information accessible only by using the scanner. ""Consumers already worried about the security of established payment mechanisms are likely to view a new technology and process with suspicion,"" commented Eden Zoller, principal analyst at Ovum. ""On the positive side, Samsung is a hugely popular smartphone brand with global reach, while PayPal is a trusted payments service provider. This is a powerful combination."" Another feature impressing the crowd was the device's black-and-white mode - designed to save battery life by limiting the power used by the screen and disabling all but essential features such as text and calls. ""Samsung appears to have cherry-picked the most crowd-pleasing features available from other manufacturers,"" said Ernest Doku from uSwitch.com. ""A fingerprint ID sensor and an attractive gold model like Apple's iPhone 5s, a water and dust-resistant body like Sony's Xperia Z2, and photography credentials to challenge the best from Nokia."" No Tizen Samsung is by far the dominant player in smartphones globally. According to Strategy Analytics, 452 million Samsung devices were shipped in 2013 - far greater than Apple's 153 million. But sales of the S5's predecessor, the S4, were seen as disappointing compared to the growth achieved by the S3. The company also faces a growing threat from emerging Chinese manufacturers such as Xiaomi, ZTE and Lenovo. Some had speculated before the event that Samsung would eventually drop Google's Android software in favour of a fledgling system known as Tizen. However, while the company's new smartwatches will use Tizen rather than Android, the flagship smartphone is, for now, sticking with Google's system. This is likely to be of relief to the search giant - it is Samsung's enormous market share that makes Android the most popular mobile operating system. ""What perhaps is the most interesting aspect of the device is what Samsung did not announce, effectively putting to bed a number of rumours,"" said Ovum analyst Nick Dillon. ""These included suggestions at both ends of the scale that that the device would be running Tizen OS and that it would be using a 'pure' Google version of Android. ""That it has neither tells us both that Tizen is unlikely to see a major handset launch this year and that Google and Samsung are still operating at arm's length.""","The next iteration of Samsung's Galaxy smartphone range will feature biometric security, the company has announced."
"By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter The morning rush hour is over and, if you live in a city in the developed world, you are likely to be settling down at your desk for the next eight or so hours. However, the office block and skyscraper, which have been part of our urban landscape since the end of the 19th Century, may also soon become surplus to requirements. Urban architect Anthony Townsend thinks cities need more creative approaches to how we work and is keen to reclaim the streets by creating pop-up workspaces in the parks and plazas of the financial district in New York. ""Before the New York Stock Exchange, traders met under a tree on Wall Street to buy and sell shares. It is only in the last 50 years that we have taken that creative energy and sucked it up into office buildings and separated it from public space,"" he said. An atrium filled with natural light and the smell of fresh coffee greets workers at Deloitte's Edge headquarters in Amsterdam, which also uses an underwater aquifer to provide ambient temperature all year round and a sensor network to monitor the use of lights - providing a better working environment while saving money. The Edge has been dubbed one of the world's greenest offices and now many are following suit - installing sensors to monitor light, electricity and water usage, planting urban gardens and offering employees access to bike or car-sharing schemes. When you pop out to buy your lunchtime sandwich though, it is a different matter. Cities are huge polluters - responsible for 70% of the world's carbon emissions, according to the United Nations. And, according to the World Health Organization, more than 80% of people living in urban areas that monitor air pollution are exposed to air quality levels that exceed WHO limits. While all regions of the world are affected, populations in low income cities are the most impacted. To counteract this, cities are rushing out a whole series of green initiatives - from electric buses (being trialled in many cities including Perth, London and Paris), to bike-sharing schemes, such as those in Montreal, Barcelona and Amsterdam. Some are committing to ""urban greening"" - London is considering a garden bridge - while in Paris, 20,000 residents have backed plans via a citizen engagement app 'Madam Mayor, I have an idea' for a 2m euro ($2.2m, £1.7m) investment in vertical gardens across the city. Officials have found 40 potential sites and are now calling on gardeners, landscape designers, urban farmers and architects to bid for projects. Horticulturist and designer Patrick Blanc has been creating vertical gardens since 2001 in city hotels, malls and tower blocks around the world. The benefits are many-fold, he said. As well as acting as a natural biofilter and providing a habitat for birds and bugs, it also feeds humans' natural sense of well-being in nature, a phenomenon known as biophilia. In China, it will take more than planting trees to combat pollution. The city authorities in smog-ridden Bejiing are working closely with IBM to use machine learning techniques to analyse weather and emissions data to predict how bad air will be over the next 10 days. According to Jonathan Batty, an IBM executive who helped set up the system, it has allowed the authorities to take short-term preventative measures. ""That might mean closing factories for a couple of days or reducing urban traffic or stopping construction work,"" he said. The government also uses the data to provide a traffic light warning system for citizens - red means air pollution is high so spend the minimum time outside, while green indicates safe levels. London provides a similar system on its city dashboard which is available to Londoners on the web. Prof Andy Hudson-Smith, who heads up University College London's Centre for Advance Spatial Analysis, came up with the idea to share data with the wider public. ""Cities now do have vast amount of information on air pollution and the data from London is all bad but it seems that citizens haven't woken up to how bad the air is,"" he said. ""I'm surprised that people haven't kicked off. This stuff is life-threatening - if you live on a main road, it can take five years off your life."" The problem with the current way of collecting air pollution data is that often people do not understand what the readings mean, he thinks. So he has a cunning plan to ""humanise IoT"" (the internet of things). He is putting around 100 internet-connected gnomes in the Olympic Park in East London. The gnomes will talk back to people as they go around the park and among other things will tell them how bad the air pollution is. Unlike more complex data sets, they will be more plain speaking, said Prof Hudson-Smith. ""They will probably just tell you to go home."" SMART CITY CASE STUDY: Jakarta Jakarta launched its smart city programme in 2014 and rather than spend vast sums of money on platforms provided by firms such as IBM and Schneider Electric, it decided its smart city approach would be much more citizen-based. It has an app - Qlue - that allows citizens to report issues, upload photos of potholes and abandoned cars they come across around the city. Floods are a major issue there and citizens can also access PetaJakarta, a joint project between the University of Wollongong in Australia and the Jakartan government. It uses tweets about floods to create a real-time map of the city. Jakarta tweets more than any other city in the world and also faces some of the worst congestion, so a Twitter account offering lift-shares - dubbed Nebenger - has attracted some 93,000 residents In another congestion-busting initiative, the city is now partnering with Google-owned navigation app Waze to share data about traffic conditions around the city.","Part two of our series ""A day in the life of a city"" looks at the ways in which offices are changing and how cities are coping with the ever-growing problem of pollution."
"The secretive ""hacker collective"" had earlier been singled-out by Sony as the possible guilty party. But a posting on Anonymous' blog said: ""Let's be clear, we are legion, but it wasn't us. You are incompetent Sony."" The electronics giant has offered compensation to users who suffer fraud as a result of the theft. Earlier this week, Sony sent a letter to the US Congress accusing Anonymous of being involved in the attack. ""Sony has been the victim of a very carefully planned, very professional, highly sophisticated criminal cyber attack,"" said the letter, signed by Sony America boss Kazuo Hirai. He said that Sony had found a file planted on its network labelled ""Anonymous"" and bearing the group's slogan, ""We are legion"". But Anonymous said that it had been framed by online thieves to throw law enforcement off track. The group, which made headlines in December 2010 after it used software freely available over the internet to temporarily bring down the sites of MasterCard and Visa, said that its members were not credit card thieves. ""Whoever broke into Sony's servers to steal the credit card info and left a document blaming Anonymous clearly wanted Anonymous to be blamed for the most significant digital theft in history,"" the statement read. Revenge attack According to Sony, the group targeted the company and facilitated the hacking in retaliation for the electronics giant's recent legal action against George Hotz. The US-based hacker was accused of breaking copyright laws by devising a way to change the operating system on Sony PlayStations. The case was eventually settled after Mr Hotz agreed not to repeat such behaviour in future. Sony claimed that the massive data theft also coincided with a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack on its website by Anonymous. Denial-of-service attacks take servers down by overwhelming them with traffic. But Anonymous denies all responsibility for allowing access to online gamers' data, including millions of credit card numbers. ""No one who is actually associated with our movement would do something that would prompt a massive law enforcement response,"" said the group's statement. ""On the other hand, a group of standard online thieves would have every reason to frame Anonymous in order to put law enforcement off the track."" Apologies and compensation Meanwhile, Sony's CEO Sir Howard Stringer has apologised for the first time to all those affected by the security breach. In a blog post on the PlayStation website, he wrote that the company was working on heightening security measures to ""protect your information better than ever"". He also offered compensation to US PlayStation Network and Qriocity users in the form of a year-long free enrolment in an identity protection programme. The programme includes a $1m (£608,000) identity theft insurance policy for each user, should they become victims of any future cyber-attacks. In a bid to reassure Sony's customers and regain their trust, Mr Stringer added that ""to date, there is no confirmed evidence any credit card or personal information has been misused, and we continue to monitor the situation closely."" Many PlayStation Network users have been upset about the company taking two days after discovering the theft before contacting law enforcement and almost a week to inform the people affected by the breach, after it was first discovered on 20 April. Targeting Viacom After publishing its statement regarding Sony, Anonymous also issued a warning to entertainment giant Viacom. The group said that because of Viacom, ""thousands of people have undergone the unfortunate experience of receiving falsely-claimed copyright infringements"". Viacom is known for taking aggressive legal action to get its content removed from video sharing websites. In 2007, the company attempted to sue YouTube for $1bn (£608m). As part of its counter-action, YouTube's parent company Google accused Viacom of uploading some videos itself and manipulating them to look like amateur copies. The case against YouTube was eventually thrown out. In its statement, Anonymous wrote: ""Anonymous demands from Viacom a public press release to admit and apologise for the fraud and crimes that they have committed. ""Anonymous also demands that Viacom allows everyone throughout the internet full rights to be able to express themselves. ""Lastly, we, the citizens of the world, demand that Viacom stops their attempts to gather personally identifying information such as IPs, which are of no relevance to them.""",Online vigilante group Anonymous has denied being behind an attack that led to the theft of personal data from around 77 million PlayStation users.
"OS X Mountain Lion makes it easier to share material to social networks and also introduces a notification panel similar to that found on many smartphones. The news was revealed in the company's third quarter earnings release . Mac sales were 2% up on the year, but the results fell short of many analysts' forecasts. The firm's shares dropped about 5% in after hours trading on Wall Street. Users trying to download the new software sometimes received error messages in the hours after its release. These included owners of new Macs who had been given coupons to redeem ""free"" copies of the system, but were told ""this code has already been used"" when they tried to use them. Mobile to Mac Apple first announced the latest update to its operating system in February. The update continues a trend to introduce features to its desktop and laptop families that have already been implemented on its iPad and iPhone mobile devices. These include the ability to upload and synchronise material with its iCloud internet storage service; the introduction of the iMessage service allowing text message-like chats between the firm's computers and handsets; the ability to easily share material to Twitter; and an application to compare the user's video game scores against those of their friends. The firm has also taken steps to aid its expansion in China including the adoption of Baidu as a search service built into its web browser's toolbar, and buttons to make it easy to share material to the Sina Weibo microblog, and the video sites Youku and Tudou. However, the firm's decision to keep its Mac system distinct from iOS for mobile devices is set to be challenged by October's Windows 8 release by Microsoft. Microsoft is offering users the chance to run the same system on both their tablets and desktop computers, making it easier to share software between them. Windows 8 - and its touchscreen Metro apps - have been described by Microsoft as the biggest revision to its interface in over a decade. But one analyst said Mountain Lion was more of an incremental step forward. ""While there are a lots of new features this is not a major upgrade like the last version Lion was,"" said Brian Blau, research director at tech research firm Gartner. ""But Apple has also been improving its Office-like software and creation applications along the way, so maybe it didn't need such a big revision. And you have to bear in mind it is only charging $20 [£13.99 in UK] for the change."" By contrast Microsoft is charging $39.99 for a Windows 8 upgrade, while Linux-based systems, such as Ubuntu and Debian, can be downloaded for free.",Apple has released the latest version of its Mac operating system.
"By Mark WardTechnology correspondent, BBC News The need to get a good sense of its size and reach has sharpened as British politicians, pundits and the media debate what influence pornography is having on children, teenagers and their understanding of what sex is all about. A lot of different statistics were quoted in those debates. However, few stand up to scrutiny. One figure that cropped up again and again is that 37% of the internet is made up of pornographic material. Many of those people who quoted the figure took it from a press release put out in June 2010 by net filtering firm Optenet. A spokesman for the firm told the BBC: ""The statistics are not up-to-date and I would not use them to reflect the reality of the web nowadays."" That might just be because there is a lot more data around. According to estimates from Scandinavian research centre Sintef, 90% of all the data the human race has ever produced has been generated in the past two years. That explosion is due to the rise of the web, smartphones, social media and the ""big data"" projects in which businesses, governments and scientists are involved. Market maker But it is worth asking if 37% was ever accurate, even in 2010. Optenet said the figure came from a ""representative sample"" of about four million URLs taken from its database of web content. However, that same year the largest study ever done into human sexuality published a very different figure for how many of the web's most popular sites were devoted to porn. The academics behind the research based their results on analysis of the million most frequented sites in the world. Their estimate? Just 4% of those websites were porn. While the two studies do not measure exactly the same metric - Optenet counted pages, the academics sites - it's worth noting that the number of pages on a site says nothing about its influence or audience. As other studies suggest, porn sites are likely to be disproportionally large as they trade on giving visitors new content and, as a result, create hundreds of new pages each day. So, suggest these studies, porn sites have huge archives but the number of pages that people actually view is relatively small. This means that it is better to measure visitor numbers rather than site size, said Dr Ogi Ogas, co-author of the huge 2010 study, A Billion Wicked Thoughts. So, why do people pick the big numbers instead? ""Big numbers are more sensational and make for good press,"" said Dr Ogas. ""But those big numbers have always been an urban myth."" Three years on, the amount of porn online was likely to make up even less of the total, he said, thanks to consolidation in the porn industry and the rise of sites that duplicate and syndicate content. Zombie stats Claims about the total amount of porn online are worth questioning because further analysis suggests the same about figures for how much traffic those sites generate. An article in Extreme Tech is regularly quoted for calculating that 30% of all net traffic is generated by porn sites. It reached this figure by estimating how much traffic one popular porn site generated each day and multiplying that by the ""dozens"" of other similar sized porn sites it said were out there. However, there are problems with its maths. To begin with, it underestimated how much data travels across the net every day. Extreme Tech claimed daily data totals were half an exabyte in 2012. Figures from network hardware giant Cisco said the figure was 1.4 exabytes. At the very least, porn traffic is part of a much larger total. There are also reasons for querying its traffic estimate. Extreme Tech said its example site got 100 million visitors a day. However, for a different story about porn sites, the BBC was told a much lower daily visitor total for that site and many others, all of which are overseen by porn hosting firm Manwin. Across all its sites, Manwin said it got about 70 million visitors per day. This figure may also be inflated because, as other studies have shown, porn sites are built to be click generators. Every mouse click on a video or still can kick off many more as a viewer is re-directed to affiliated sites, adverts or pop-ups. So, visitor numbers for those sites and consequently how much traffic they generate look likely to be a lot lower. A blogger at the Ministry of Truth blog reached a broadly similar conclusion when they analysed the 30% statistic and many others in a series of posts. That blogger concluded that porn accounts for a few percentage points of overall traffic and is dwarfed by YouTube and the bigger social networks. They described facts and figures about online porn as ""zombie statistics"" because, like the undead, they refuse to lie down even when effort was made, time and time again, to kill them off. Few people took the time to look into the source of the statistics, said the blogger, which explained why people continued to quote figures that date from the days before the web existed or come from marketing materials, small unrepresentative surveys or off-the-cuff comments. The dubious provenance of statistics about porn are well-known inside the tech industry. ""We are aware that a number of statistics are being used in relation to online safety and have concerns over their accuracy,"" said Nicholas Lansman, secretary general of ISPA, which represents net supply firms. Anyone quoting stats should check their veracity, he said. ""It is vital that any decisions in relation to online safety, like any other policy area, are based on evidence rather than myths and assertions,"" he added. What is worth remembering is that even if there is a lot less porn online than many people claim, there is still a lot out there, said Dr Ogas ""Fourteen per cent of searches and 4% of websites devoted to sex really are very significant numbers, when you stop to ponder it.""","Many things in porn are exaggerated, including the statistics regularly quoted to show how much pornography is on the web."
"The data is said to help the NSA track individuals, and map who they know, to aid the agency's anti-terror work. The ""dragnet surveillance"" was condemned by digital rights groups who called for the NSA's snooping efforts to be reined in. The news comes as Microsoft plans to use more encryption to thwart NSA spying on it and its customers. Wrong target The huge database built up by the NSA (National Security Agency) keeps an eye on ""hundreds of millions"" of mobile phones, said the Post, adding that it let the agency map movements and relationships in ways that were ""previously unimaginable"". It added that the vast programme potentially surpassed any other NSA project in terms of its impact on privacy. Information about the programme was in papers released to the Post by whistleblower Edward Snowden. The spying agency is said to have accumulated so much data, about 27 terabytes according to leaked papers seen by the Post, that it was ""outpacing"" the NSA's ability to analyse the information in a timely fashion. The analysis, via a computer system called Co-Traveler, was necessary as only a tiny fraction of 1% of the data gathered was actually useful in its anti-terror work, said the paper. The analysis is so detailed that it can be used to thwart attempts to hide from scrutiny by people who use disposable phones or only use a handset briefly before switching it off. The vast majority of the information gathered is said to come from taps installed on mobile phone networks and used the basic location-information that networks log as people move around. Analysing this data helps the NSA work out which devices are regularly in close proximity and, by implication, exposes a potential connection between the owners of those handsets. The American Civil Liberties Union said it was ""staggering"" that the NSA could mount such a vast location-logging system without any public debate. The ""dragnet surveillance"" broke US obligations that require it to respect the privacy of foreigners and Americans. ""The government should be targeting its surveillance at those suspected of wrong-doing, not assembling massive associational databases that, by their very nature, record the movements of a huge number of innocent people,"" it added. The steady flow of information about the NSA's surveillance work has led Microsoft to take steps to protect itself and its customers from unwarranted scrutiny, it said in a blogpost. Brad Smith, Microsoft legal counsel, said government snooping was now as much of a security problem as computer viruses and other cyber-attacks. In response, Mr Smith said, Microsoft was expanding its use of encryption; would fight legal orders that stop it telling customers when their data is being sought and would allow a closer look at the code it develops to show there were no backdoors built in.","Almost five billion mobile phone location records are logged by the NSA every day, reports the Washington Post ."
"Dave LeeNorth America technology reporter In his experiment, rodents were quite literally stitched together in order to share bloodstreams. Soon after he found the older mice started showing signs of rejuvenation: better memory, improved agility, an ability to heal more quickly. In later years, researchers at institutions like Stanford would reinforce this work. The extraordinary technique became known as parabiosis, and forms the basis of efforts at Alkahest, a California start-up that is banking on being able to apply those rejuvenative effects to people, rather than mice. It's an idea so fantastical it wouldn't look out of place in an episode of Silicon Valley, the HBO send-up of the start-up scene. And to all intents and purposes, it was. Season four, episode five. During a meeting, tech executive Gavin Belson introduces young Bryce... his blood transfusion partner that would keep him young. Like so much great comedy, Silicon Valley hits the right spots because it rings true. Alkahest is providing the Bryce to real life Gavin Belsons through the movement of blood plasma, obtained by young donors all over the world. Blood of our youth ""Silicon Valley luminaries are looking at their old form as they get older and thinking, 'What can I do about this?'"" said Kristen Brown, a biotech journalist for technology news site Gizmodo. ""It's the classic Silicon Valley mindset: 'How do I hack this problem?'"" For this week's episode of Click, I was given the task of trying to make sense of this desire to stretch our lifespans, or at least our health span - the number of years we remain fit and able before the troubles of old age kick in. Some measures - like sucking the blood out of our youth, for instance - are at the more dramatic end of the scale. But elsewhere in the ""longevity space"", as I heard it called, we see something more low-key, backed up with something at least approaching a scientific consensus. So I decided to start there. HVMN - pronounced human - is a start-up that encourages smart fasting. It is of course something that humans have done for thousands of years, but it's only in our more recent history that we've understood more fully how the body reacts, and more importantly, what it produces while we're deep into a fast. Beginning on a Monday night, I started the Monk Fast - 36 hours in which I could only drink zero-calorie liquids. In my case, that meant a diet of just water and black coffee. ""My advice to you is sleep in really late so you don't have to deal with it,"" Ms Brown joked. Here come the ketones Staying in bed wasn't an option. The following morning I skipped breakfast (for the first time in years) and met Geoffrey Woo, chief executive and co-founder of HVMN. The company focuses on products Mr Woo claims can boost the effects of fasting. According to the company's Biohacker Guide, there is a ""growing body of scientific research"" that showed ""health benefits including longevity, improved metabolic state, improved insulin resistance, and cognitive improvement"". Mr Woo says depriving yourself of nutrition provokes the body to produce ketones, a byproduct of your organs turning to your stored fat for fuel. ""As one gets better at being in ketosis,"" he told me, ""it becomes a productivity boost."" The UK's NHS has warned about ketosis as a result of a low-carb diet which can be linked to headaches, weakness, nausea, dehydration, dizziness and irritability. To help with my own fasting, I tried one of HVMN's products, a ""super fuel drink"" that is supposed to almost instantly get my body to start producing ketones at a level that would ordinarily take several days of fasting, not the mere few hours I had achieved by that point. To begin, we did a quick blood test to measure the current level of ketones in my body. It was low - 0.2 millimolar. The $30 (£21)-a-pop supplement - officially classified as a food by the US regulator - came in a small plastic bottle that in a former life might have held cheap aftershave. I unscrewed the top and knocked back the substance like a shot of suspect liquor, going back for a second effort to finish off the last drop. HVMN has valiantly tried to mask the smell of it, but it could do little about the bitter, sharp taste. Some 30 minutes later, we repeated the test. I didn't feel remarkably different, but my ketone level suggested otherwise: 2.2. ""It's the equivalent to having fasted for three or four days,"" Mr Woo explained. 'Lunacy' The question is: do I believe him? In the run-up to filming our story, I'd read about how HVMN apparently hid away a report it had commissioned into the effects of Sprint, another one of its products. The unfortunate conclusion was that it had little effect on alertness beyond that of a strong cup of coffee. Headlines at the time suggested the company did what it could to stifle the report's publication, but Mr Woo insists that wasn't the case. Indeed, the company now links to the study - which Mr Woo co-authored - on its website. To find out more, I drove to the Buck Institute for Research on Aging which is based in the beautiful city of Novato, near California's wine country. It's the kind of place that would make you want to live as long as possible. Here I met Dr Eric Verdin, one of the world's foremost experts on the science of ageing. ""Fasting elicits a response in your body that triggers a protection against many of the diseases that are associated with ageing"" he explained. ""So there's growing realisation that multiple forms of fasting might actually be beneficial in the long term. The science is really strong in this area."" He was less persuaded by Alkahest's claims of using young blood to rejuvenate the old. ""First let's talk about science in mice. It is amazing work, the science is strong. ""Taking this and bringing it to humans is a completely different story. The idea that one would take human plasma and give it to humans to prevent ageing is, in my opinion, lunacy."" Trials ahead But to be clear, Dr Verdin's concern with Alkahest, and other companies like it, was mostly about safety and risk of infection, owing to the current process this technique requires today. As for the possibility it would work, he says we simply don't know. Alkahest chief executive Karoly Nikolich is confident but acknowledged the lack of solid science. He told the BBC that a small study of 18 people suffering from early-stage Alzheimer's had shown positive results. Once a week over four weeks they were each given one unit of plasma taken from, probably, a student aged 18-30. Over time, Mr Nikolich said those patients showed a better ability to perform basic daily tasks, and were more aware of their surroundings and sense of self. But anecdotal evidence on how someone feels and acts is hardly conclusive. A more formal study presented by the company to an Alzheimer's conference in Boston last year couldn't even prove minimal benefits. The company is pressing ahead, buoyed by other academic studies that built on Paul Bert's work and discovered that something in young mouse blood can fight Alzheimer's in the older mouse - they just haven't figured out what it is yet. Spanish medical company Grifols recently invested $40m in Alkahest, and as a result will be a partner as it solicits blood donations from young people all over the world to be used in longer, more far-reaching studies. The holy grail in this industry would be discovering specifically what can fight ageing - and bottling it. ""Ultimately we might be able to identify agents that could be administered orally,"" Mr Nikolich said, while predicting it might take more than a decade. Breaking fast By Tuesday night, my own attempts to reverse the ageing process had left me feeling 20 years older. It was over 24 hours since my last calorie, and I was struggling. I'd spent the evening at the cinema after a friend suggested - incorrectly - that it would take my mind off food. What I found was that while fasting my mind became unable to process multiple inputs at once. After parking and getting out of the car, I started walking towards the cinema - only for my friend to point out that not only had I not locked the car, but the engine was still running. By Wednesday I felt a little better, but still uneasy on my feet. My 36 hours were up, and after inhaling pancakes at one of Oakland's finest breakfast spots, I came to the conclusion that while scientists may be learning that fasting can indeed give you a longer life, there's no way they can convince me it'll be a happier one. You're not you when you're hungry, as the slogan goes. My own rumbling tummy aside, is Silicon Valley on course to achieve its goal? ""We see the body as a platform to innovate,"" said Mr Woo, but Mr Verdin sees tech's contribution slightly differently. ""They're bringing incredible resources,"" he said By which of course, he means cash. There's oodles of it pouring into this - and of all the daft ideas backed in this part of the world, I guess living longer and being healthier is something worth putting some money behind - lest we start stitching teenagers to billionaires.","To understand what's happening in the tech world today, you need to look back to the mid-1800s, when a Frenchman named Paul Bert made a discovery that was as gruesome as it was fascinating."
"Once completed in 2020, the Jupiter cable will stretch for more than 14,000km and will be able to carry more than 60 terabits of data a second. The two firms have joined Jupiter as part of plans to build their own global networks and cut data transport costs. The cable is one of many in which the net's biggest firms, including Google and Microsoft, have recently invested. Network edges ""There's a bit of a boom in terms of the internet content providers taking a leading role in the development of new submarine cable systems,"" said Alan Mauldin, research director at analyst firm Telegeography. The big net firms were involved in about 16 separate cabling ventures, he said, and used the capacity to handle the massive amounts of data their users generate. Some projects have already been completed but most are due to start carrying data sometime in the next few years. The net firms were most interested in joining projects that lay cables across the Pacific, the Atlantic and Asia, he said. They have acquired capacity on many other cables around the world as well. ""They started years ago building their own networks because the scale that they need is bigger than a carrier can provide,"" he added. ""Having a global backbone network is a big cost for them."" By running their own networks, big net firms gain control over the system, keep costs low and get some redundancy in case of problems, he said. ""Cables do break sometimes so you need multiple paths and alternatives,"" he said. Net giants are involved in lots of cable-laying projects Traditional telecoms firms were also investing in the cable-laying projects to help boost their own trans-ocean bandwidth, he said. Although the big net firms have colossal data needs, they could not use all the bandwidth available on the submarine cables. Mr Mauldin said the data needs of search firms, social networks and cloud providers were growing rapidly while some others, such as Netflix, did not have to splash out on large networks to handle their traffic. Netflix avoided high bandwidth costs by pushing all its content out to the edges of the network where it is stored ready for use. This worked, he said, because an episode of a TV show or a film would not change much once it was made and shipped out to media servers. By contrast, he said, the dynamic content seen on Facebook had to be updated constantly feeding a demand for more bandwidth.",Facebook and Amazon are putting cash into a project to lay a new submarine cable that will link Asia and the US.
"Members of the BBC Radio 4's You and Yours team were among those who received the scam emails, claiming they owed hundreds of pounds to UK firms. The firms involved have been inundated with phone calls from worried members of the public. One security expert warned clicking on the link would install malware. You and Yours reporter Shari Vahl was one of the first on the team to receive an email. ""The email has good spelling and grammar and my exact home address...when I say exact I mean, not the way my address is written by those autofill sections on web pages, but the way I write my address. ""My tummy did a bit of a somersault when I read that, because I wondered who on earth I could owe £800 to and what was about to land on my doormat."" She quickly realised it was a scam and did not click on the link. ""Then, a couple of minutes later, You and Yours producer Jon Douglas piped up as he'd received one and then another colleague said he'd received one too, but to his home email address,"" she added. Ransomware The You and Yours team decided to contact the companies that were listed in the emails as being owed money. A spokesman for British Millerain Co Ltd, a waxed cotton fabric manufacturer, told the programme that the firm ""had more than 150 calls from people who don't owe us money"". And a spokeswoman for Manchester shelving firm Greenoaks said: ""My colleague took a call from an elderly gentleman and he was very distressed because his wife had had one of these emails."" Dr Steven Murdoch, principal research fellow at the department of computer science at University College London, told You and Yours: ""Most likely it was a retailer or other internet site that had been hacked into and the database stolen, it then could have been sold or passed through several different people and then eventually it got to the person who sent out these emails."" He said that the email bore the hallmark of previous phishing attempts from gangs in Eastern Europe and Russia. He said that clicking on the link would install malware such as Cryptolocker, which is a form of ransomware that will encrypt files on Windows-based computers and then demand a fee to unlock them. Anyone receiving such an email is advised to delete it and report it to the national fraud and cybercrime reporting centre Action Fraud.","A new type of phishing email that includes the recipient's home address has been received by thousands of people, the BBC has learned."
"Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent@BBCRoryCJon Twitter But I've been gnawing over two nagging questions. How did Twitter's co-founders, who never seemed that sure what kind of business they wanted to build, end up with the right recipe? And why don't we in the UK seem able to produce similar companies? The first question was provoked by reading an excellent new book about the company, Nick Bilton's Hatching Twitter. It paints a picture of three men not quite out of the top drawer of Silicon Valley software types, each with something of an inferiority complex, at least when mixing with all the Stanford and MIT graduates at firms such as Google. Perhaps because of that, they seem even more determined to follow their own path. While they are working together at a failed start-up called Odeo, founded by Williams, the idea of Twitter emerges as a side venture - although whose original idea it is, will become a matter of enduring acrimony. Indeed the feuding between the founders - and in particular Williams and Dorsey - over who should run the business and what direction it should take is on an epic scale. First Dorsey is forced out as CEO, then after months of plotting, he exacts his revenge and Williams suffers a similar fate. The two disagree fundamentally on what Twitter is for - Dorsey believes it's all about sharing your status with friends, so the status update box says, ""What are you doing?"". But Ev changes that to ""What's happening?' to reflect his belief that Twitter has a broader mission as a place to share news. But neither seems to worry too much about finding a business model, and it is only when Dick Costolo is elevated to CEO in the coup led by Dorsey that the commercialisation of the service begins in earnest. That at least is the picture painted by Nick Bilton, and it certainly rings true. The three co-founders have come together again to appear in the video shown to potential investors in the run-up to this week's IPO. Sitting perched on stools they don't look at ease in each other's company, and the video does nothing to explain just why they believe Twitter can make the huge amounts of money it needs to justify an ever higher valuation. But, by accident or design, they have built a global audience and are now starting to convince advertisers that Twitter can offer them a smart way to connect with customers. So many things have gone wrong along the way, from the internal feuding to the constant technology problems that took the site offline for hours or even days at a time, that it seems a miracle that it has come so far. Which brings me to my second question: Why was Twitter possible in California but not in the UK? From ARM to Mind Candy, we do produce successful tech firms, but nothing that grows so far and so fast as a Twitter or a Facebook. We have people just as talented as Dorsey or Stone, but somehow they never get quite as far. Apart from the important fact that it provides a huge market for any start-up, the other answer for me is that the US, and Silicon Valley in particular, is still a place where optimism rules and anything feels possible. Despite all the setbacks and disagreements, the Twitter trio and their venture capital backers remained profoundly positive about their belief that their technology could change the world. Here in the UK, our first reaction to anything new is too often a furrowed brow or a dismissive sneer rather than a ""Wow, that's cool!"" Even for the most optimistic entrepreneur it is difficult to keep going when everyone is telling you that you're doomed to fail. The sad truth is that most tech start-ups will fail to meet their founders' expectations - but unless we believe that there is a chance that just a few will make it big, then we're unlikely to hatch a British Twitter.","For Jack Dorsey, Ev Williams and Biz Stone these are heady days. A plan hatched just seven years ago now looks certain to culminate in a triumphant stock market debut for Twitter this week."
"By Zoe KleinmanTechnology reporter, BBC News I was doing some ironing when my mum came in to tell me that a family friend had been killed in a road accident in Thailand. My phone was on the worktop behind me. But the next time I used the search engine on it, up popped the name of our friend, and the words, ""Motorbike accident, Thailand"" and the year in the suggested text below the search box. I was startled, certain that I had not used my phone at the time I had had the conversation - my hands had been full. Had I started to look the details up later on and forgotten? Or was my phone listening in? Almost every time I mentioned it to people they had a similar story, mainly based around advertising. Cybersecurity Alert special index How to hack the average home Hanging out with the script kiddies Ukraine blackout hacks 'could happen elsewhere' One friend complained to her boyfriend about a migraine, her first ever, only to find the next day she was being followed on Twitter by a migraine support group. Another had an in-depth chat with her sister about a tax issue, and the next day was served up a Facebook advert from tax experts offering advice on that exact issue. Many said they were discussing particular products or holiday destinations and shortly afterwards noticed advertising on the same theme. Community website Reddit is full of similar stories. One reporter mentioned his male colleague seeing online adverts for sanitary pads after discussing periods with his wife in the car. But surely if the microphone was activated and the handset was sending data, battery life would be even worse than it is now and individual data usage would be through the roof? Tech challenge I challenged cybersecurity expert Ken Munro and his colleague David Lodge from Pen Test Partners to see whether it was physically possible for an app to snoop in this way. Could something ""listen in"" at will without it being obvious? ""I wasn't convinced at first, it all seemed a bit anecdotal,"" admitted Mr Munro. However, to our collective surprise, the answer was a resounding yes. They created a prototype app, we started chatting in the vicinity of the phone it was on and watched our words appear on a laptop screen nearby. ""All we did was use the existing functionality of Google Android - we chose it because it was a little easier for us to develop in,"" said Mr Munro. ""We gave ourselves permission to use the microphone on the phone, set up a listening server on the internet, and everything that microphone heard on that phone, wherever it was in the world, came to us and we could then have sent back customised ads."" The whole thing took a couple of days to build. It wasn't perfect but it was practically in real time and certainly able to identify most keywords. The battery drain during our experiments was minimal and, using wi-fi, there was no data plan spike. ""We re-used a lot of code that's already out there,"" said David Lodge. ""Certainly the user wouldn't realise what was happening. As for Apple and Google - they could see it, they could find it and they could stop it. But it is pretty easy to create."" ""I'm not so cynical now,"" said Ken Munro. ""We have proved it can be done, it works, we've done it. Does it happen? Probably."" Google responds The major tech firms absolutely reject such an idea. Google said it ""categorically"" does not use what it calls ""utterances"" - the background sounds before a person says, ""OK Google"" to activate the voice recognition - for advertising or any other purpose. It also said it does not share audio acquired in that way with third parties. Its listening abilities only extend to activating its voice services, a spokesperson said. It also states in its content policy for app developers that apps must not collect information without the user's knowledge. Apps found to be breaking this are removed from the Google Play store. Facebook also told the BBC it does not allow brands to target advertising based around microphone data and it never shares data with third parties without consent. It said Facebook ads are based only around information shared by members on the social network and their net surfing habits elsewhere. Other big tech companies have also denied using the technique. Coincidence There is of course also a more mathematical explanation - the possibility that there is really no connection at all between what we say and what we see. Mathematics professor David Hand from Imperial College London wrote a book called The Improbability Principle, in which he argued that apparently extraordinary events happen all the time. ""We are evolutionarily trained to seek explanations,"" he told the BBC. ""If you see a sign you know is associated with a predator you run away and you survive. ""It's the same sort of thing here. This apparent coincidence occurs and we think there must be explanation, it can't be chance. But there are so many opportunities for that coincidence to occur. ""If you take something that has a tiny chance of occurring and give it enough opportunities to occur, it inevitably will happen."" People are generally more alert to things that are currently occupying them, such as recent conversations or big decisions like buying a car or choosing a holiday, he added. So suddenly those sorts of messages stand out more when they may have been in the background all the time. Beautiful Prof Hand is not immune to the lure of coincidence himself. When his book was published another author published a very similar title at the same time. The author of The Coincidence Authority, John Ironmonger, shared the same birthday as Prof Hand and was based at the same university as his wife. ""These sorts of things happen,"" he said. ""Just because I understand why it happened doesn't make it any less beautiful.""",It all began with a car crash.
"Tarot readings, spells, curses and blessings are among the ""intangible"" categories being removed by the site. The decision has been made because conflicts between buyers and sellers of these services are difficult to resolve, eBay said. All listings of this kind will be removed in September, it added. A petition against the decision on website gopetition.com has gathered 1440 signatures, reports Wired. ""I bought a spell on eBay to help a relative who was having difficulties at work and we were amazed by the results,"" said Michelle Hobbs from Dorset. ""If you do believe in that sort of thing and you believe it works then you should be allowed to buy it."" Michael Marshall, vice-president of the Merseyside Skeptics Society, is less convinced. ""I think it's solid consumer protection,"" he told BBC News. ""It's a very wise decision. Some people will cry it's a form of censorship, but the fact of the matter is things like tarot, spells and curses are all highly unproven. ""There are plenty of tarot readers out there who genuinely believe they have a psychic gift but that doesn't make it any more real."" In a statement on its website, eBay said that people continuing to list services in this category after the 30 August deadline may have their accounts suspended.",The sale of a range of fortune-telling and witchcraft-related services will be prohibited on online auction site eBay after 30 August 2012.
"The largest network ties together more than 350,000 accounts and further work suggests others may be even bigger. UK researchers accidentally uncovered the lurking networks while probing Twitter to see how people use it. Some of the accounts have been used to fake follower numbers, send spam and boost interest in trending topics. Hidden purpose On Twitter, bots are accounts that are run remotely by someone who automates the messages they send and activities they carry out. Some people pay to get bots to follow their account or to dilute chatter about controversial subjects. ""It is difficult to assess exactly how many Twitter users are bots,"" said graduate student Juan Echeverria, a computer scientist at UCL, who uncovered the massive networks. Mr Echeverria's research began by combing through a sample of 1% of Twitter users in order to get a better understanding of how people use the social network. However, analysis of the data revealed some strange results that, when probed further, seemed to reveal lots of linked accounts, suggesting one person or group is running the botnet. These accounts did not act like the bots other researchers had found but were clearly not being run by humans. His research suggests earlier work to find bots has missed these types of networks because they act differently to the most obvious automated accounts. The researchers are now asking the public via a website and a Twitter account to report bots they spot to help get a better idea of how prevalent they are. Many bots are obvious because they have been created recently, have few followers, have strange user names and little content in the messages. The network of 350,000 bots stood out because all the accounts in it shared several subtle characteristics that revealed they were linked. These included: It was ""amazing and surprising"" to discover the massive networks, said Dr Shi Zhou, a senior lecturer from UCL who oversaw Mr Echeverria's research. ""Considering all the efforts already there in detecting bots, it is amazing that we can still find so many bots, much more than previous research,"" Dr Zhou told the BBC. Twitter deserved praise for its work on finding and eliminating bots, he added, but it was clear that skilled hackers had found ways to avoid official scrutiny and keep the bots ticking over. The pair's most recent work had uncovered a bigger network of bots that seemed to include more than 500,000 accounts. ""Their potential threats are real and scary due to the sheer size of the botnet,"" he said. It was hard to know who was behind the collections of fake accounts, said Dr Zhou, although there was evidence that a small percentage of the accounts had been sold or rented as they were now following Twitter users outside the main bot network. ""What is really surprising is our questioning on the whole effort of bot detection in the past years,"" said Dr Zhou. ""Suddenly we feel vulnerable and don't know much: how many more are there? What do they want to do?"" A Twitter spokesman said the social network had clear policy on automation that was ""strictly enforced"". Users were barred from writing programs that automatically followed or unfollowed accounts or which ""favourited"" tweets in bulk, he said. Automated responses ""degraded"" the experience for other users and was prohibited, he added. ""While we have systems and tools to detect spam on Twitter, we also rely on our users to report spamming,"" he said.","Massive collections of fake accounts are lying dormant on Twitter, suggests research."
"By Leo KelionBBC News, Las Vegas The sensors and computing power we've become accustomed to in our smartphones are starting to migrate to body-worn devices used for new purposes. Google has stoked excitement for the category after teasing its forthcoming Project Glass headset, but it already faces competition from Vuzix which has been showing off its own Android-powered eyewear at this year's Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas. The lightweight kit places a tiny widescreen colour monitor in front of the user's right eye so that it appears to hover towards the top of their field of vision. Users control it by pressing buttons placed close to their ear, or via a smartphone paired via Bluetooth. Initial features are set to include the ability to stream and record video - but the US company's boss suggests developers will soon exploit the hardware for other uses. ""You like Guinness and you are in New York city - you could say to your glasses 'Is there stout around here?',"" chief executive Paul Travers gives as an example. ""The app kicks in, the camera feeds out and you see an arrow showing which way to go. ""Another possibility would be: you are in France, you go into a restaurant and look at the menu and the glasses translates it for you."" The public will have to wait to see if it fulfils its potential when the M100 headset launches this summer. Runner's readout In the meantime another heads-up display has just gone on sale in the US. O-synce's Screeneye X is a sports visor with a built-in display that shows two numbers in green in the style of a digital watch. They can be set to represent a runner's speed, heart rate, lap time, distance travelled or other data measured by sensors connected to the visor by a radio link. Professional athletes have trained with computers for years, but Stephen Maris - the man in charge of the launch - says it's social media that has helped make the innovation ready to be pitched to the public. ""People like to share what they're doing and by getting it digitised they can do that very easily via sites like Strava,"" he says. ""You can then use this data to compare your performance to your friends' and anyone who has done the same routes."" Smart watch It's early days but this kind of product could become big business. Tech consultancy iSuppli suggests that by 2016 more than 92 million wearable technology devices will be sold a year. It's not just about headsets. Pebble Technology is also at CES to publicise the impending release of its smart watch. The wrist-worn computer will run apps on its e-paper display - a feature chosen to ensure it can be read in sunlight - and go a week without recharge, It appears there is demand for such a device. When the developers turned to crowdfunding site Kickstarter to raise $100,000 (£62,000) they ended up with over $10m. ""We've seen firsthand that there is a huge demand for mobile companions that make email notifications, messages, alerts and more easily accessible,"" says chief executive Eric Migicovsky. ""I am confident that smart watches and similar wearable devices will grow to be an important part of our daily lives."" Studying skateboarders Over at Xsens' booth a model wearing 15 sensors on different parts of her body strikes a pose. On a screen behind her a computer animated figure made up of small dots matches her moves. The kit and software are a spin-off of the Netherlands-based firm's motion capture technology, originally developed for movies including The Avengers and Ted. The idea is to offer consumers a chance to digitise their actions and play them back as 3D graphics to help perfect their skills. One ready-made market, suggests chief technology officer Per Slycke, would be new skateboarders and other extreme sports enthusiasts. He's at CES to find third-parties wishing to license the tech and use it to take advantage of the growing number of products built with activity trackers inside. ""They're in helmets, watches, bracelets and sports shoes,"" he says. ""With our software you can add intelligence to data that is already being collected. The challenge is to present it to the user in a meaningful way."" Lost and found One sign that a technology is going mainstream is when it starts targeting pets and children. That's the case with StickNFind - circular stickers the size of a few 10p pieces stuck together which contain a Bluetooth chip, temperature sensor and battery. They are designed to be used with a smartphone app which shows a radar image covering a 200ft (61m) radius. Stick it on the cat's collar, the company suggests, and it becomes much easier to locate the moggy when trying to lock up a house. Perhaps more usefully it can also be used by parents to keep track of their kids in public by sending an alert if they are wander off. Co-founder Jimmy Buchheim says the innovation was inspired by an incident involving his eldest daughter. ""When she was three years old, she decided to play hide-and-seek in a department store,"" he says. ""She hid behind some boxes. ""They had to close the section down and everyone was looking for her. Imagine if I had had this sticker - I would have found her immediately."" If the launches and previews at CES are anything to go by, the wearable tech revolution is just getting under way.","Welcome to the future, where your body is technology's new frontier."
"By Alex HudsonBBC News Computer games are regularly criticised as a waste of time and for offering graphic depictions of violence. Regardless of the truth of the opinion, a form of game offering a different side has increased in popularity - the serious game. ""The story of games, in popular terms, is a story about adolescent boys in dark bedrooms,"" says journalist Tom Chatfield, who has developed computer games. ""It was only really when the interfaces of games at the start of the 90s, became visually significant and serious that people started to realise that what they were doing might be a reflection of the world, in the same way as a book or a film or an article is."" Serious games focus on real-world situations and events in a way that it is hoped educates the players and provokes debate in a community. Three billion hours a week are spent on playing games, mainly as a pastime rather than having any large global effects, and developers hope some of that time can be harnessed for the greater good. One game, a World Without Oil, explored the theory that oil was running out and offered players the chance to come up with ways to deal with the impending crisis. ""In America, there was an undercurrent where we just said 'this is a bubble, this is going to pop',"" says Ken Eklund, designer of the game. ""Oil did hit $200 a barrel a few months later so things were really happening. ""These stories get put together and become this coherent multi-threaded, multi-authored story about what an oil crisis might really be like, emotionally, not just about who has oil and who doesn't and how much productivity is being lost. What does it feel like? ""The actual spirit of the game, from the players' point of view, is they said 'we are creating something which the government should pay attention to'. As a matter of fact, the government did. ""The federal government was very interested, especially the people responsible for disaster response. ""The players are proud of what they have created as a narrative."" Government 'games expert' Games have been created about a wide variety of issues. The Middle East conflict has been addressed by Games for Change, in the hope to inform people of both sides of the discussion. ""The big idea was it was about perspective,"" says Asi Burak, co-president of Games for Change. ""You could choose either to be either the Israeli prime minister or the Palestinian leader. Just by that choice and playing a whole different game from each perspective, we could show you the war through a very different lens. ""In terms of impact, what I discovered was the game was more than anything else, a great opener of discussion. I learned that people don't discuss it in daily life in Israel in the West Bank or in Gaza."" With games having increasing influence, governments are becoming more interested in being involved. In the US for example, there is a games expert attached to the White House. But the real question is what can change after a large number of people play through a serious game. Using the example of the Middle East conflict, the troubles are still ongoing. But can a game really be expected to inspire tangible changes in such a big issue? ""It's always very difficult to come up with a direct chain of cause and effect,"" says Mr Chatfield. ""In terms of games feeding into society, I find it very difficult to offer a huge example of 'this game changed the world'. That's a very dangerous promise to make. It's a promise that you will almost inevitably fail to deliver."" The problem with these promises could be that direct analysis of the results from a game is rarely fully carried out. ""One of the things that has never really been done well is evaluation of outcomes,"" says Mary Matthews, former strategy director at Blitz Games Studios. ""We now have web games that have millions of hits on their site and people take the fact that people have engaged with that play as being successful. ""Nobody at that time was looking at measurable outcomes. They played it but then what?"" One place it is hoped measurable outcomes will be achieved is in the classroom. A virtual gameshow offering teenage players a decision about what constitutes sexual coercion is currently being trialled in some sex education classes in Coventry and Warwickshire, produced by the Serious Games Institute and Coventry University. ""One of the things that's very striking when you spend time in a classroom of teenagers is just how easy it is for them to get bored or distracted,"" says Dr Katherine Brown, leader of the Sash Research Group at Coventry University. ""The more innovative you can be with what techniques you use, the more likely you are to be successful in delivering the education you are trying to get across. ""Having that technology does instantly engage the young people in the classroom. It's completely novel to them that their teacher would use this kind of technology to deliver a lesson on sex education."" Which could bring us back to the beginning of computer games, if they really were about adolescent boys in dark bedrooms, this time with a much more serious point.","Serious games, which have addressed issues as varied as the Middle East conflict through to sexual coercion among teenagers, have gained the attention of governments around the world. But can they really directly affect the issues they cover?"
"It had previously said it was working on such a car but did not say when it would be available. The news, reported by Chinese language website TechWeb, will put it head to head with rival Google. The firm will work with an unnamed car manufacturer, according to Baidu's senior vice president Jin Wang. He made the announcement at the China Cloud Computing conference. The firm has previously teamed up with BMW to develop semi-autonomous car technology. The head of Baidu's deep learning lab Yu Kai has previously told the press that the firm does not agree with Google's view of a completely autonomous car, looking instead to develop a vehicle that will retain the traditional pedals but give the driver greater freedom. Key battleground Artificial intelligence is rapidly becoming a key battleground for tech firms, with self-driving cars seen as one of the first practical applications for the technology. Baidu's rise in the field of artificial intelligence suffered a setback last week when Stanford University -which runs an AI test to see whether computers can recognise and sort images - banned Baidu from competing for the next year. The web giant was stripped of its 2015 title after it emerged that it broke the rules over how many tests it could run. Google announced last month that its prototype self-driving cars would take to the public roads this summer around its headquarters in Mountain View, California. It also recently revealed that its cars had been involved in 13 minor accidents over the six years of tests.","Chinese web giant Baidu will launch its first driverless car in the second half of 2015, it has announced."
"By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor Owners will be able to attach the new devices to an existing PS4 controller via a special mount to play titles powered by the console's processors. Until now this ""remote play"" facility had only been offered to the firm's PlayStation Vita handheld console. Experts said the feature should help Sony's kit stand out from Android rivals at a time when competition is intensifying. But despite the popularity of the PS4, they added, the move was likely to have only a slight impact on sales. The Japanese company also unveiled a new smartwatch and a fitness tracker at a press conference in Berlin, ahead of the start of the Ifa tech show. The launches come a month after Sony cut its smartphone sales forecast by 14% for this financial year, saying its original figure was too ""optimistic"". The firm's global handset market share has slipped from 3.9% to 3.1% over the past year, according to research firm IDC, as Chinese rivals have made gains. 'Best of Sony' The Z3, Z3 Compact and Z3 Tablet Compact all rely on a wi-fi link to control the PS4 and view the graphics it generates. The firm suggests the feature will appeal to gamers who have to share use of the living room TV. ""Our promise to the consumer has been to bring the best of Sony - all our consumer electronics experience - into a smartphone,"" Calum MacDougall, head of Xperia marketing, told the BBC. ""We've consistently delivered that in the Z series with digital imaging capability, with our TV screen technology, with our audio capability. And now this is a big step up to almost complete the set with gaming functionality."" Praise for the move was qualified. ""For the gaming fraternity this is certainly something that would pique their interest when looking across a kind of homogenous set of smartphones that largely look the same and do the same kind of thing,"" said Ben Wood, head of research at CCS Insight, a telecoms consultancy. ""But I'm not sure it will be a killer feature."" Ryan Reith, mobile devices analyst at IDC, agreed that the facility had appeal to a niche audience, but said at this point the majority of gamers' needs were met by existing tablet and phone apps. Hard corners Other features of the Z3 smartphone include: The firm has also taken the relatively unusual step of keeping the phone's 5.2in (13.2cm) screen at 1080p resolution rather than using a higher resolution panel. While this limits the level of detail displayed, the firm says the benefit is that the handset offers a longer-than-average two days of use between battery charges. Rejecting round Sony also updated its wearable tech range with two new products. The Smartband Talk is a waterproof wristband that tracks the user's physical activity and can last three days between charges. It also acts as a remote microphone and speaker for Bluetooth-connected Android phones, letting owners make calls from their wrist. The SmartWatch 3 is Sony's first watch to be powered by Google's Android Wear operating system, which is designed for small screens. It also adds four gigabytes of internal memory, allowing it to offer ""offline"" music playback at times the owner does not have their phone with them. Unlike LG and Motorola, Sony only offers its watch in a square design rather than a circular option, which some believe is more fashionable. ""We believe the squarer screen is the better way to go to offer better second-screen functionality,"" said Mr MacDougall. ""Whether it's looking at your life-log application or notifications, you get a much richer experience in that way."" However, he declined to rule out Sony releasing a circular watch at a later stage. ""Let's see if Sony has a round screen at CES in January,"" remarked Mr Cross in response. ""All the feedback we're getting is that for wearables to be attractive they need to become more fashionable, and the circular watches have resonated with the consumer and fashion media as to what we want. ""At least Sony now has a stake in the ground with Android Wear, which we believe will become the most pervasive smartwatch operating system outside anything Apple do.""",Sony's latest smartphones and tablets can stream PlayStation 4 video games.
"By Shiroma SilvaBBC News The agency's director Rob Wainwright told the BBC's Panorama that regulators and industry leaders need to work together to tackle the problem. The warning comes after Bitcoin's value fell by half from record highs in December. UK police have not commented to the programme. Mr Wainwright said that Europol, the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation, estimates that about 3-4% of the £100bn in illicit proceeds in Europe are laundered through cryptocurrencies. ""It's growing quite quickly and we're quite concerned,"" he said. There many different types of cryptocurrencies but the best known is Bitcoin. They are intended to be a digital alternative to pounds, dollars or euros. However, unlike traditional currencies, they are not printed by governments and traditional banks, nor controlled or regulated by them. Instead, digital coins are created by computers running complex mathematical equations, a process known as ""mining"". A network of computers across the world then keeps track of the transactions using virtual addresses, hiding individual identities. The anonymous and unregulated nature of virtual currencies is attracting criminals, making it hard for police to track them as it is difficult to identify who is moving payments. 'Money mules' Mr Wainwright said: ""They're not banks and governed by a central authority so the police cannot monitor those transactions. ""And if they do identify them as criminal they have no way to freeze the assets unlike in the regular banking system."" Another problem Europol has identified involves the method that criminals use to launder money. Proceeds from criminal activity are being converted into bitcoins, split into smaller amounts and given to people who are seemingly not associated with the criminals but who are acting as ""money mules"". These money mules then convert the bitcoins back into hard cash before returning it to the criminals. ""It's very difficult for the police in most cases to identify who is cashing this out,"" Mr Wainwright said. He said that police were also seeing a trend where money ""in the billions"" generated from street sales of drugs across Europe is being converted into bitcoins. He called on those running the Bitcoin industries to work with enforcement agencies. ""They have to take a responsible action and collaborate with us when we are investigating very large-scale crime,"" he said. ""I think they also have to develop a better sense of responsibility around how they're running virtual currency."" 'Too slow' Although British police have yet to respond to requests from Panorama, Parliament is seeking to step up regulations. The Treasury Select Committee is looking into cryptocurrencies and details of EU-wide regulations to force traders to disclose identities and any suspicious activity are expected later this year. Alison McGovern, Labour MP for Wirral South who is serving on the committee, has been calling for an inquiry into cryptocurrencies. ""I think that will draw the attention of the Treasury and the Bank [of England] and others to how we put in place a regulatory system,"" she said. ""I think probably hand on heart we have all been too slow, but the opportunity is not lost, and we should all get on with the job now."" ""Who Wants to be a Bitcoin Millionaire?"" is a collaboration between BBC Click and Panorama and airs on BBC One on 12 February at 20:30 GMT.","Three to four billion pounds of criminal money in Europe is being laundered through cryptocurrencies, according to Europol."
"Like many chat apps, Teams lets colleagues send each other whimsical animated Gif images. But CyberArk researchers discovered a problem that meant viewing a Gif could let hackers compromise an account and steal data. Microsoft has since patched the security hole, researchers said. The flaw involved a compromised subdomain serving up the malicious images. All a user had to do was view the Gif to allow an attacker to scrape data from their account. If left open, the flaw could have led to widespread data theft, ransomware attacks and corporate espionage, the team added. Microsoft Teams, like many workplace collaboration tools, has seen huge growth in the past month, due to coronavirus lockdown rules. This attack involves using a compromised subdomain to steal security tokens when a user loads an image - but the end user would just see the Gif sent to them, and nothing else. ""They will never know that he or she has been attacked - making this vulnerability... very dangerous,"" the team said. CyberArk said it notified Microsoft of the vulnerability on 23 March - the day lockdown began in the UK - and a patch was released earlier this week. There is no evidence it was ever exploited by cyber-criminals. It also warned that a similar attack could be replicated in future on other platforms. Prof Alan Woodward, from the University of Surrey, said this type of exploit had been seen before, when applications fail to do the necessary checks while bringing in content from servers - in this case ""apparently harmless gifs"". While the attack pattern is not easy to set up, it is a workable attack and ""could spread very rapidly between all the users"", he said. ""It would be a very niche attack, probably reserved for high-value targets. ""It is a really good demonstration of how data, however apparently innocuous, brought into a web based app can be used to sneak snippets of code onto your machine and conduct functions you simply shouldn't be authorised to do,"" added Prof Woodward. ""It also demonstrates very nicely so-called zero-click attacks - my merely displaying the gif in this attack could potentially work, no clicking in dodgy links or opening booby-trapped documents."" But Prof Woodward added that all software was bound to have security flaws occasionally. ""It's a salutary tale of why you need to keep your software updated,"" he said","A security problem in Microsoft Teams meant cyber-attacks could be initiated via funny Gif images, researchers have revealed."
"Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent@BBCRoryCJon Twitter And even very recent predictions seem to be going awry. Figures last week from Apple showed iPad sales slowing, and growth in the overall tablet market is looking less than spectacular, so the idea that the conventional desktop PC is in its death throes now seems to be a bit oversold. Nevertheless, Radio 4's The World At One is taking the brave step of trying to forecast the hot technology trends that we all need to know about. Over the next few days, the programme will look at 3D printing, drones, unmanned cars and the internet of things and ask how these advances might change our lives. But to inject a healthy dose of scepticism, the series begins today with a look at the Hype Cycle. This is an exercise carried out by the research firm Gartner which has a theory about the way new technology arrives in our lives. The firm describes five stages through which new ideas progress - the innovation trigger, the peak of inflated expectations, the trough of disillusionment, the slope of enlightenment, and finally the plateau of productivity. Last year's Hype Cycle had 3D printing and wearable user interfaces at an overexcited peak though both were expected to mature into profitable technologies. Biometric identification and speech recognition were much further along, climbing up onto that plateau of productivity. Looking back, some technologies - supersonic travel for instance - have never really delivered on the overhyped expectations of their backers. Will that be the case for some of the ideas now being touted as game changers? I've been convinced for a while that wearable technology is the next big thing, but a few doubts have begun to creep in. None of the products that I've tried so far, from Google Glass to Samsung's latest smartwatch, has convinced me that the wearable revolution is yet ready to reach beyond a minority of enthusiasts. Virtual assistants, such as Apple's Siri and Microsoft's Cortana, are becoming ever more sophisticated, benefitting from the advances in speech recognition and natural language processing. But they still fail a basic test - for most people they are still a gimmick rather than a really useful addition to their lives. And for all the hysteria about big data, companies and governments are still proving better at imagining how this will improve our lives than giving us concrete examples of where that is happening. Of the four technologies chosen by the World At One, I would bet on the Internet of Things having the most impact in the short term. Billions of objects - from cars, to mousetraps to dustbins - are being hooked up to the internet. That should mean cities work more efficiently - and businesses can sell us their products more effectively. Then again, that could all turn out to be a lot of hype. Tune in to the World at One all this week to find out more.","Predicting the future shape of technology is a fool's game. If you believed the forecasts of future-gazers when I was growing up, we would all be taking holidays on the moon, consuming our meals in tablet form and enjoying a 10-hour working week by now."
"By Chris FoxxTechnology reporter EE's Simon Till said the ""shoebox-size"" antenna would let more people access the company's 4G broadband service. The company said it had delivered speeds of 100Mbps to homes during a trial in Cumbria. One analyst said the plan would appeal to people who could not get fast speeds through a fixed broadband line. ""We've heard of farmers doing a similar thing, putting up masts on their edge of their property near where the signal is,"" said Andrew Ferguson of the news site Thinkbroadband.com. ""The DIY approach has been bubbling away, but EE offering it as a service makes it a lot more simple."" EE already offers home broadband, either through a fixed phone line or over the 4G mobile network. It said its new antenna installation service was designed for homes in areas where fixed line service was poor or not available at all. Telecoms watchdog Ofcom defines decent broadband as a speed of about 10Mbps to download. At that speed, downloading a high-definition film could take up to 90 minutes, according to Ofcom. EE said its 4G home broadband could deliver download speeds of up to 100Mbps and upload speeds of about 10Mbps. However, it is possible that areas too remote for fixed broadband also have poor 4G coverage. ""There may be instances where that's the case, but our network reaches 90% of the UK,"" said Mr Till, referring to EE's geographic coverage across the UK. ""If you overlap our network with the homes that get less than 10Mbps fixed broadband, you get to about 580,000 homes that we could reach."" Reduced interference EE will charge people £100 to have a broadband antenna installed on their home. The device will typically be mounted high up, facing the nearest EE mobile phone mast. It will be connected by a cable to a modem and wi-fi router inside the property, to give the residents wireless internet access. Placing a large antenna outside reduced interference from walls and double glazing, said Mr Ferguson. ""Stick the antenna outside and you get a much better signal,"" he told the BBC. ""Unfortunately, with it being 4G, that's where the data allowance comes in. If you're bingeing TV box sets you'll get through that pretty quickly."" EE said its most expensive package would give homes a 200GB monthly data allowance for £60 a month. Similarly priced fixed broadband packages are usually advertised as ""unlimited"". Mr Till defended the data allowance and said EE's home broadband customers typically used about 150GB a month. ""If your home has access to fixed broadband, then that would probably be the right choice, but if you can't then this is an option,"" said Mr Till. ""We're in the business of providing connectivity to those that don't have it."" Analysis: By Rory Cellan-Jones, technology correspondent Having hit a target of giving 95% of homes access to superfast broadband, the government now has a thornier problem - working out how to connect the remaining 5%. So there will be a welcome for EE's initiative, which appears to be a solution to delivering the Universal Service Obligation - the right to demand a broadband connection of at least 10Mbps. The government had always said that various technologies, including 4G, would need to be deployed if every corner of the UK was to be given an acceptable connection. But rural broadband campaigners will still need convincing that EE's 4G home service can deliver acceptable speeds at a reasonable price.",Telecoms company EE has revealed plans to sell a 4G antenna that promises to bring fast broadband internet to thousands of homes in rural areas.
"By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter The low-cost credit-card sized computer is widely used by schools and the maker community for programming devices. Google has asked makers to complete a survey about what smart tools would be ""most helpful"". And it suggests tools to aid face and emotion recognition, speech-to-text translation, natural language processing and sentiment analysis. Google has previously developed a range of tools for machine learning, internet of things devices, wearables, robotics and home automation. The Raspberry Pi Foundation said the new tools could enable makers ""to build even more powerful projects"". ""Google is going to arrive in style in 2017. The tech titan has exciting plans for the maker community,"" said the foundation in its blog. A Google spokeswoman told the BBC: ""We don't have any specifics to announce right now, but we're excited to keep sharing more open source machine learning tools with the community - stay tuned for more this year."" Eben Upton, founder of the Raspberry Pi Foundation, told the BBC: ""It's fantastic to see Google getting closer to the maker community. ""I'm particularly excited about the prospect of connecting Raspberry Pi to some of the machine learning work coming out of Google DeepMind in London, allowing us to build smart devices that interact in the real world."" In 2015, the Raspberry Pi became the most popular British computer ever made. More than 10 million have now been sold. The Pi, which was originally manufactured in Wales, has been adopted by school children, programmers and inventors around the world. It is also increasingly being used by the business community.",Google is planning to bring artificial intelligence and machine learning tools to the Raspberry Pi.
"By Paul RubensTechnology reporter Yet we still forget them. And they also get stolen with alarming frequency. The reported theft of 1.2 billion email passwords by Russian hackers earlier this month was just the latest in a long string of major password security breaches that have led some people to wonder if the use of passwords should be abandoned. But what are the alternatives? One low-cost option, according to Dr Ant Allan, an authentication expert at Gartner Research, could be biometrics, making use of the microphones, cameras and web cams most computers and mobile devices are equipped with. The simplest way to log on might be through facial recognition - or ""authentication by selfie,"" as Dr Allan calls it - because it would require the user to do nothing more than look at their computer or mobile screen. Logging in using voice recognition would also be straightforward, he argues. Security for these authentication methods can be beefed up by adding contextual information such as GPS data from a mobile phone, or simply the time of day. If a user tries to log on at an unusual time or place then additional authentication information can be requested. Digital portrait Biometric authentication systems from companies like BioCatch use several different types of biometrics and other information at the same time to build a complex profile of a user. This works as a kind of digital portrait that can be used to recognise them. At the simplest level a profile includes information about the devices and the internet address that the user typically logs in from. To this is added a physical profile of the user - voice or face biometrics - and characteristics that can be learned from a computer's camera or a mobile device's GPS, gyroscope and other sensors. These characteristics can include whether the user is left or right handed, how tall they are, the length of their gait, and a measurement of their hand-eye co-ordination. After this a ""cognitive profile"" is built up by monitoring preferences such as where windows are placed on the screen, how quickly the user actually uses the computer or mobile device, and what their typing or touch gesture patterns are. Finally, the user's response patterns to a variety of ""challenges"" are measured. ""The system may introduce a bias which changes where the device thinks your finger is placed on the screen,"" explains Dr Allan. ""It's very subtle and not enough for you to see, but enough for you to correct for it,"" he says. Since different people correct for it in different ways, information about their responses to these hidden ""challenges"" can be added to their overall profile. What's different about this type of authentication approach is that is uses ""active"" or ""continuous"" authentication. Rather than making authentication a single event, the system continues to monitor a user's characteristics and behaviour for as long as they are logged on. ""The benefit of this is that you get increased confidence that the user is who they say they are over time, and you also can also keep checking that the person using the system is the same person who logged on originally,"" explains Dr Allan. A much simpler approach that could be suitable in some circumstances is to tie a user to a particular computer or mobile device, Dr Allan suggests. ""This is a simple measure that goes a long way,"" he says. ""If a user tries to log on using a different machine, they would have to do something extra to authenticate themselves,"" he adds. Researchers in Germany and the Netherlands have been exploring ways to identify devices accurately as part of a European project called Puffin - short for ""Physically unclonable functions found in standard PC components"". They have examined seemingly identical computer parts, such as memory chips, and found that tiny variations in conditions during the manufacturing process give each one has a unique digital fingerprint, or physically unclonable function (PUF). Software that can read these PUFs can be used to identify a computer or mobile device reliably, says Pim Tuyls, the chief executive of Intrinsic-ID, a commercial partner in the Puffin project. The sound of your voice These approaches don't work when users have to authenticate themselves over a conventional telephone - to access phone banking services, for example. Since voice is the only physical biometric available over the phone, Barclays Bank has begun to authenticate some of its customers using ""voice print"" analysis. The system checks the speaker's voice in real time against a signature pattern they already have stored. ""The idea is to be as transparent as possible so the customer won't know that they are actually logging in,"" explains Seb Reeve, marketing manager at Nuance, the company that makes the biometric system. ""The system listens to the customer speaking, and after ten or fifteen seconds it will pop up a green traffic light in the call centre to confirm that the person is who they say they are, and the conversation can continue."" But Karsten Nohl, a member of a German security collective called Security Research Labs, warns that hacking voice recognitions is trivial. ""You can pretty much make any voice sound like any other,"" he says. He also points out that you can't change biometrics like your fingerprints, iris pattern, or voice, whereas you can change passwords. That's a problem if a hacker makes an imitation finger, say, with your fingerprint on it. These can easily be made to appear ""alive"" by spraying them with graphite to simulate the properties of skin, and by breathing on them to add a realistic amount of moisture, he adds. Even so, he admits that while biometrics may not be as secure as long random passwords, they are probably more secure than the simple, easy-to-remember passwords that many people use. ""Long passwords are simply impractical, while something like a fingerprint is very practical,"" he says. For the moment, though, the traditional username and password pair is still by far the most common way for people to authenticate themselves online. The reason - despite all the password security breaches - is that passwords offers a reasonable level of security at very low cost, according to Andras Cser, a security analyst at Forrester Research. ""It is hard to find something that offers a higher level of security for the same money that a password system costs,"" he says. ""There are other ways of authenticating- but many companies are unwilling to cough up.""","Passwords are a pain. We choose simple words that are easy to remember, but equally easy for hackers to guess."
"The National Cyber Security Centre said it estimated 7,000 servers had been affected by the flaw in the UK and only half had been secured. It said malicious software had been detected on 2,300 machines but it had helped businesses remove it. The agency said it was ""vital"" that all affected businesses took action to secure their email servers. The announcement reveals the scale of the problem among UK companies for the first time since the global security flaw emerged last week. Ransomware groups have begun using the flaw to install their malicious programs, the NCSC warned - though there was no evidence of widespread ransomware attacks on UK companies so far. Once installed, ransomware locks away a user's data behind strong encryption, making the computer system unusable. The group then demands payment to unlock it - and if demands are not met, will steal or delete the data. Free-for-all The security flaw affects Microsoft's widely-used Exchange email system, which powers the email of major corporations, small businesses and public bodies worldwide. The NCSC is particularly concerned about small and medium-sized businesses that may not have heard about the issue. Initially, the flaw was being exploited by a hacking group to gain remote access to email servers, from which it could steal sensitive data. But after Microsoft warned the world it had identified the problem, and urged all its users to download the latest security updates, other hacking groups quickly became familiar with the flaw. The result is a widespread free-for-all as multiple hacking groups all try to find unpatched email servers to attack. ""We are working closely with industry and international partners to understand the scale and impact of UK exposure, but it is vital that all organisations take immediate steps to protect their networks,"" NCSC's director for operations Paul Chichester warned. ""While this work is ongoing, the most important action is to install the latest Microsoft updates."" He also urged all organisations to ""familiarise"" themselves with the guidance surrounding ransomware attacks - and to search for any signs of their systems already being compromised. An emerging picture The true scale of this problem is still emerging with thousands of systems vulnerable in the UK alone. What is not yet entirely clear is the overall impact. While many systems are still at risk and thousands had malicious software installed, the number of cases where we know this was actually used to steal emails or lock people out with ransomware is still fairly low. That may change in the coming days as more reports come in. What is clear is that multiple hacking groups have piled in to exploit the vulnerability and those working on the defensive side are likely to stay busy for some time to come.","More than 3,000 UK email servers remain at risk from the global Microsoft Exchange email flaw, officials believe."
"Dave LeeNorth America technology reporter The flaw, revealed on Tuesday, made it possible to access a Mac without a password, and also have access to powerful administrator rights. The latest version of MacOS will automatically download the update. ""We greatly regret this error and we apologise to all Mac users,” the firm said. ""When our security engineers became aware of the issue Tuesday afternoon, we immediately began working on an update that closes the security hole. ""This morning, as of 8am PT, the update is available for download, and starting later today it will be automatically installed on all systems running the latest version (10.13.1) of MacOS High Sierra.” It is only second time Apple has forcibly updated users’ machines and comes in response to widespread concern that millions of Mac computers were at risk. Users running older versions of MacOS will see a notification prompting an upgrade. ""Security is a top priority for every Apple product,” the company said. “And regrettably we stumbled with this release of MacOS.” It added: ""Our customers deserve better. We are auditing our development processes to help prevent this from happening again.” Disclosure Attention is now turning to the way in which the bug was made public. The story hit headlines after the flaw was tweeted by Lemi Ergin, a self-described ""software craftsman"". He was criticised for not adhering to ""responsible disclosure"" guidelines in security research, whereby companies are given a reasonable amount of time to fix a flaw before it is made public. However, after coming for criticism for tweeting the vulnerability, Mr Ergin published a post on Medium defending his decision. ""I am neither a hacker, nor a security specialist,"" he wrote. ""I solely focus on secure coding practices while programming, but I can never call myself a security specialist."" He said his colleagues at payments firm Iyzico informed Apple about the flaw on 23 November. It had previously been discussed on open Apple support forums on 13 November - though the user described the issue more like a feature than a serious bug. Apple's own statement on Wednesday said the company's security team were not made aware of the problem until 28 November - though it is not clear if another department at the company was aware.

It had raised nearly $3.7m (£2.8m) on Indiegogo when it was launched as a crowdfunding project in 2014. In December, it was reported that Jibo Inc had sold its assets to an investment firm. Journalist Dylan Martin shared a video of the robot on Twitter, saying its goodbyes and ending with a dance. ""Maybe someday when robots are way more advanced than today, and everyone has them in their homes, you can tell yours that I said hello,"" the robot says. Jibo has not updated its Twitter account since July 2018 and it last posted on its Facebook page, where it has 98,000 followers, in May last year.

And its creator has called Facebook's decision to finally ban it now ""odd"". About 400 apps were suspended as a result of the audit, which looked at the way programs that piggy-back on the social network gathered and shared information on its users.

But the University of Cambridge Psychometric Centre deputy director David Stillwell, who co-created the app in 2007, said it had been ""certified"" as compliant with Facebook's terms shortly afterwards. The centre said the data harvested by the app had been used by researchers in more than 45 studies published in journals. And Mr Stillwell told TechCrunch that Facebook had known for a long time how the data had been being used.

"The site, which attracts 65 million unique users a month, has invited existing users to join a closed pilot while the final touches are fine-tuned. The redesign could help the site gain ground on YouTube. The Google-owned site announced that it deals with four billion video views every day. Central to Vimeo's changes, the company said, were improvements in how content within the site is found by visitors. Users are now recommended related videos based on their ""likes"" and other algorithms. Updates to the site can now be tracked in a revamped news feed allowing users to follow subjects, keywords and individual users - much like Facebook or the blogging service Tumblr. High-end professionals Vimeo argued that the redesign - which has so far been well received by the site's regular users - stands out from YouTube thanks to its ""focus"" on content. ""A lot of people come to Vimeo because they care about how content is created,"" Deborah Szajngarten, Vimeo's communications director, told the BBC. ""That's everyone from the soccer mom who doesn't want ads over their children's video, to high-end professional content creators."" Ms Szajngarten cited Vimeo's embeddable video player - which she said did not and would not carry advertising - as crucial in her firm's tussle with Google's site. ""What we see a lot of is bloggers that have accounts in both places. ""On their website, the player they embed is almost always Vimeo because they know it will look better."" Media analyst Theresa Wise told the BBC that Vimeo should avoid looking to compete with YouTube, and instead build on attempts to attract ""Vimeo can't compete head on, there's no gap. ""But if you're looking to build a career, you're maybe making more of a brand statement by putting yourself on Vimeo - saying 'I'm a professional filmmaker - take notice'. ""That's a smaller market, but it's a significant one."" Sixty hours In a blog post on Monday, YouTube said users uploaded more than 60 hours of footage per minute - an increase of 30% in the last eight months, and a 10-fold increase since 2007. Google redesigned YouTube's homepage to offer more emphasis on ""channels"" - curated lists of videos on a chosen subject area. YouTube celebrated dominating the bigger market by putting togetheronehourpersecond.com, a website depicting some of YouTube's biggest recent hits, such as Rebecca Black's Friday, Fenton the Dog and the Nyan Cat. The figures come despite widespread upset at the site's recent major redesign in December last year. In contrast, Vimeo's design had until today remained mostly untouched since 2007. ""We are a much bigger company than we were then,"" a Vimeo spokeswoman told the BBC. ""We kind of saturated our existing infrastructure as we added features and new things to do.

"The team from Keen Security Lab remotely manipulated the brake system on a Tesla while it was on the move, from a distance of 12 miles (19km). Using a laptop, the hackers also managed to open a car door without using a key. Tesla has updated its software to prevent anyone else from manipulating its cars. The hack took place after months of research and the team from Keen Security Lab posted a video of their efforts earlier this week on YouTube. During the experiment a hacker took control of a vehicle from the passenger seat, while someone else was behind the wheel. Using a laptop, he was able to adjust the rear-view mirror while the driver was changing lanes. The hacker also managed to open the trunk remotely, while the car was on the move. Analysis: Dave Lee, BBC North America technology reporter, San Francisco This hack is notable for two reasons. One, it was conducted far away - as far as 12 miles, researchers said. And two, the sheer amount of control it can wrest from the driver is remarkable - brakes, windscreen wipers, all sorts. The good news is the security community is so far rising to the challenge of protecting cars from hackers. This hack was discovered by researchers who, as they should, went straight to Tesla before going public. Tesla's cars are able to get over-the-air updates, meaning Tesla's engineers can automatically rectify the vulnerability in its cars without drivers needing to visit a dealership. And that's precisely what the company has done.

"Developers said theirprototype provided extra feedbackabout game characters' actions. For example they said the device could mimic the recoil of a gun or the motion of a boat on water better than what could currently by achieved by vibrating a controller. The device is being pitched to Microsoft among other console makers. Engineers from the University of Utah showed off the device at the Haptics Symposium in Vancouver - a conference organised to highlight the latest research into the sense of touch. ""In the centre of the thumbsticks there's a little contact bud that is similar to what you have on a Thinkpad laptop - a little red dot,"" Prof William Provancher from the university's department of mechanical engineering told the BBC. ""In our case that dot moves, and when it moves it provides touch feedback which allows us to enhance sensations such as gunfire. ""The feeling is very similar to what you get if you place your finger down on a table top and drag it across - it stretches the skin. In this particular case the tugging on your skin is happening because of the motion-device mechanism beneath the thumbsticks."" Fishing thumbs So far the researchers said they had built a library of five tactile effects: bounce, pulse, a circular movement, a wave effect and the feeling of crawling along the ground. In addition they said the thumbsticks could be used to give directional cues drawing users' attention to part of the gaming environment. To demonstrate their invention the researchers have created Feelin' Fishy - a simulation which causes the thumbsticks to sway side to side, imitating waves pulling on a fishing line. The controller also stretches the skin of users' right thumbs to signal when they should try to hook a fish, and then emulates it tugging against the rod. The team is also developing a music-based title in which the sticks' motion is linked to the tones being played - the higher the note the faster they move. Army remote controls The controller was developed as part of a three year research study funded with a $150,000 (£94,530; 113,360 euros) research grant from the US-based National Science Foundation. It evolved out of a project which originally focused on building a steering wheel designed to send signals to one hand or the other to tell drivers to turn left or right. Although the engineers are now focused on video games, Prof Provancher said the device might still have real world uses. ""The military have started using game controllers to interact with things like robots and unmanned vehicles,"" he said. ""So for instance if it's a robot that's on the ground it could be information about obstacles in the environment, or if it was a drone aircraft flying over doing surveillance perhaps it's processing the information and giving a cue to the remote pilot to focus their attention on something interesting."" Compatibility issues Prof Provancher said he had already shown the device to Microsoft researchers and had been asked to give a more detailed presentation at the firm's Redmond headquarters. He also hopes to attract further interest when he attends the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco later this week. If one of the console manufacturers decides to license the technology, the professor said he expects the thumbsticks will add about £10 to the retail price of a controller. However, if he fails to win over one of the console makers the innovation is likely to struggle since it depends on software being written specifically for it and does not give motion feedback for other games.",A video games controller which pulls and stretches the skin of its users' thumbs has been unveiled in Canada.
"Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent@BBCRoryCJon Twitter Now the National Audit Office has found that the whole programme is nearly two years behind schedule, so it may be 2017 before we can boast about our tiptop broadband to our European neighbours. What's more, the government's plan to spark a competition between telecoms firms to lay fibre across the country has also proved a failure. BT will now win every contract, and will end up with a government subsidy of £1.2bn once you throw in the matching funds that every council has had to provide. Now the company may claim, with some justification, that nobody else saw a commercial case in getting involved in rural broadband. But the end result of this very lengthy process has been to squash the competition and make life harder for smaller rivals that could have been more innovative. Take, for example, the Isle of Wight. There a company called Wightfibre laid fibre optic cables a decade ago - its investors lost money by betting too early on fast broadband - and now has about 4,000 customers on the island. The Isle of Wight council is about to sign the £6m contract to bring fast broadband to those parts of the island that the market wont reach. But because of the way the national procurement process was framed, Wightfibre was unable to qualify to compete for that money because the company wasn't big enough to supply other parts of the country. So BT will get the subsidy. And Wightfibre's CEO John Irvine says that will make it even harder for his firm to compete. ""I'm not saying: 'Give me that £6m',"" says Mr Irvine. ""Just don't give it to BT."" The council says, quite understandably, that its job is to make sure that its more far-flung households aren't left on the wrong side of a digital divide, and it has to obey the national rules to get access to the national funds. The other complaint is about what happens to the final 10%, the very hardest people to reach - though the government is now saying that should only be 5% by 2017. The companies and community groups with ambitions to fill this last gap in the UK's broadband provision say they are in limbo right now because of a lack of information. They say BT is being secretive for commercial reasons about exactly where its fast services will reach in each county. Until it's known whether the company will actually be laying fibre to Much-Binding-in-the-Marsh, the argument goes, it is impossible for the Much Binding community network to start digging. BT, which has been summoned to a rural broadband summit by the current Culture Secretary Maria Miller to discuss this issue, says it can take six to nine months after the signing of a contract to work out exactly which areas will be reached. Overall, the UK is not doing too badly in fast broadband provision - in the cities at least. Speeds, competition and availability are all on an upward trend. But that makes it all the more galling for people in many rural areas. They've been promised jam tomorrow - and now they are wondering whether tomorrow will ever come.",It always seemed an unlikely ambition - but now we know that Jeremy Hunt's promise that Britain would lead Europe in fast broadband provision by 2015 will not be met. The former culture secretary made the promise back in 2010 when he unveiled the £530m plan to bring fast broadband to rural Britain.
"By Katia MoskvitchTechnology reporter, BBC News The internet chat service wasn't the first to allow people to make voice calls over the internet. But by allowing the public to make computer-to-computer calls free and using peer-to-peer technology - which meant that connections improved the more people who used it - it helped popularise the concept. Today Voip (voice over internet protocol) and video chats are something many of us take for granted. And Skype faces competition from a multitude of rivals, including Google Hangouts, Apple's Facetime, Blackberry's BBM, Tango and Viber. But on this anniversary it's perhaps worth reflecting on the impact the technologies can have on people's lives. Take the example of Lu Yang and Hamid Sirhan. When the London-based newlyweds decided to have a baby, Lu knew that her Chinese parents would not be able to come and visit them often. As it turned out, her mother and father were not even able to make the journey when her daughter Yasmina was first brought home. But video calls made it possible to introduce the baby to her grandma and grandpa in Beijing. ""We talk to them every single evening, and it is the only way for them to see their granddaughter grow,"" says Yang. ""They can't afford to come to London at the moment, and we can't afford to go there, either."" Yang adds that she has also used the technology for much more serious pursuits. Until recently, she worked for a London-based charity that helps persecuted freelance journalists worldwide. ""It's the only and unique way to get in touch with certain journalists from countries with repressive regimes, such as some former Soviet states,"" says Yang. ""They simply can get killed if they try to get in touch with us using the phone, to discuss the stories they are working on, which are usually stories about corruption and crime."" Robot doctors The facility has also been a boon for doctors. For example, Dr Maneesh Batra from Seattle Children's Hospital in the US routinely calls Kiwoko Hospital in rural Uganda to offer his expertise to local doctors. He says that using video makes it easier to explain complicated procedures than trying to do so by email or voice alone. A team of researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the US is trying to take this a step further with a spin-off company, iRobot. They have developed a regulator-approved machine that glides through hospital corridors letting medics call in on patients based in other buildings. To let them do this the robot features a 15in (38cm) screen, microphone and built-in camera which connect to InTouch Health's video-conferencing system. ""There's an ageing population, especially in developed countries, there's a crisis around the cost of providing healthcare and we have robotics technology - so you put all of those things together and you come out with solutions,"" Jeff Beck, the firm's chief operating officer, tells the BBC. Of course, older patients might feel a little less positive about the idea of their doctor ""teleporting"" into consultations via such machines. Split-screen photos Technology giant Microsoft bought Skype in 2011 for $8.5bn (£.5.5bn), and as you might expect, Microsoft's corporate vice-president for Skype, Mark Gillett, has his own favourite story about how the technology can ""bridge people's lives together"". ""About a year ago I saw a couple of portraits where people had hooked up their laptops to a projector and [used the software] to bring a family together,"" he tells the BBC. ""It was a split family in North Korea and China. They could never otherwise have been together. It was such a visual and graphic representation of the power of video to just dissolve geography."" But for all its benefits, there is also a dark side to the rise of video-conferencing tech. Earlier this week an Australian military cadet was found guilty of using Skype to stream footage of himself having sex with a female colleague to a room of other students, without telling the victim of his plan. The incident has prompted the government to order a review into wider allegations of sexism in the military. There have also been numerous instances of people using such programs to persuade juveniles to strike suggestive poses and then using recordings of the footage to blackmail them into doing worse. ""The fact that people can use this type of software while making themselves difficult to trace means they that it can be abused, sometimes very badly indeed,"" warns John Carr, secretary of the UK's Children's Charities' Coalition on Internet Safety. ""It's why parents need to talk to their children about being careful about who they agree to speak to."" However, he adds that on a personal level video-conferencing recently came ""to the rescue"" of his family. His pregnant daughter's Cambodian partner had been refused access to the UK by the immigration authorities shortly before the birth, which the parents-to-be had wanted to happen in England. As a result he was unable to be present on the big day - but a tablet computer helped him avoid being completely shut out of the event. ""The iPad was running Skype within a minute of Ivy arriving, while she was still attached to the umbilical cord and resting on her smiling but exhausted mother's chest,"" Mr Carr recalls. ""Some of the first sounds Ivy heard were of her dad speaking to her in Khmer. The battle-hardened midwives all blubbed.""",It's been 10 years since Skype came on to the scene.
"The test saw Facebook ""manipulate"" news feeds to control which emotional expressions the users were exposed to. The research was done in collaboration with two US universities to gauge if ""exposure to emotions led people to change their own posting behaviours"". Facebook said there was ""no unnecessary collection of people's data"". ""None of the data used was associated with a specific person's Facebook account,"" the social networking giant added. Cornell University and the University of California at San Francisco were involved in the study. Ability to manipulate? But some have criticised the way the research was conducted and raised concerns over the impact such studies could have. ""Let's call the Facebook experiment what it is: a symptom of a much wider failure to think about ethics, power and consent on platforms,"" Kate Crawford posted on Twitter. Lauren Weinstein tweeted: ""Facebook secretly experiments on users to try make them sad. What could go wrong?"" Meanwhile, Labour MP Jim Sheridan, a member of the Commons media select committee has called for an investigation into the matter. ""This is extraordinarily powerful stuff and if there is not already legislation on this, then there should be to protect people,"" he was quoted as saying by The Guardian newspaper. ""They are manipulating material from people's personal lives and I am worried about the ability of Facebook and others to manipulate people's thoughts in politics or other areas. ""If people are being thought-controlled in this kind of way there needs to be protection and they at least need to know about it."" However, Katherine Sledge Moore, a psychology professor at Elmhurst College, Illinois, said: ""Based on what Facebook does with their newsfeed all of the time and based on what we've agreed to by joining Facebook, this study really isn't that out of the ordinary."" ""The results are not even that alarming or exciting."" 'Very sorry' The research was conducted on 689,000 Facebook users over a period of one week in 2012. According to the report on the study: ""The experiment manipulated the extent to which people were exposed to emotional expressions in their News Feed"". The study found that users who had fewer negative stories in their news feed were less likely to write a negative post, and vice versa. Adam Kramer of Facebook, who co-authored the report on the research, said: ""We felt that it was important to investigate the common worry that seeing friends post positive content leads to people feeling negative or left out"". ""At the same time, we were concerned that exposure to friends' negativity might lead people to avoid visiting Facebook."" However, he admitted that the firm did not ""clearly state our motivations in the paper"". ""I can understand why some people have concerns about it, and my co-authors and I are very sorry for the way the paper described the research and any anxiety it caused.""","Facebook is facing criticism after it emerged it had conducted a psychology experiment on nearly 700,000 users without their knowledge."
"By Leo KelionTechnology reporter The FIA international motorsports body plans to launch the electric-car competition next year as an alternative to Formula 1. Qualcomm will provide wireless-charging and augmented-reality technology to help the teams taking part and the public watching the races. It has also pledged an undisclosed sum of money as part of the five-year deal. Both organisations said the intention of the championship was to both provide entertainment and to spur on electric-vehicle technologies. One analyst said the events could help improve the public's perception of electric cars, but added there would need to be other developments if the tech was to go mainstream. The FIA itself acknowledged change would not come overnight. ""We will make people more inclined to buy an electric car, but this will take time - five or 10 years,"" Formula E's chief executive Alejandro Agag told the BBC. Wire-free recharges Among the products Qualcomm plans to offer is its wireless vehicle-charging tech, Halo. The facility - which is being developed by the company's London-based lab - creates an electromagnetic field using a copper pad buried in the ground. This can be picked up by a coil built into a vehicle, which converts it into electricity to power-up a battery. British Formula E team Drayson Racing Technologies has already tested a customised version of Halo as a way of charging its vehicles when they are stationary. However, the intention is to use the tech to recharge only the competition's safety vehicle during the first year of the championship before extending it to the competitors' cars in either year two or three. In time, Qualcomm said, several pads could be built into the city centre roads used by the races to provide ""dynamic charging"" - the ability for the cars to top up their power on the go, helping them complete the race in quicker time. South Korea has already pioneered something similar, using a locally developed variant of mobile recharging tech called OLEV to power buses on a set route. However, such schemes are costly and the FIA said it recognised the competition would need to prove popular if it was to raise the sums necessary to pay for the installation of the many pads required. Live updates Qualcomm also intends to help design the telemetrics system used by the race - the automated process that monitors the vehicles taking part. ""Tyre pressure, engine, fuel, brake fluid, speed, torque - all sorts of things will be monitored on a miniscule nanosecond by nanosecond basis,"" explained Anand Chandrasekher, Qualcomm's chief marketing officer. ""Those streams of data will be sent real-time to a central area where the teams will be able to get access to that information and use it with their own proprietary software to say, 'OK, what guidance should we provide the driver as to what he or she should be doing in real time?'"" He added the information would also be able to be accessed by the public through the planned roll-out of its Vuforia software. The app promises to offer an ""augmented reality"" view of the race, allowing spectators to carry on watching the car of their choice even if buildings or other objects obstruct their view by holding up their smartphone or tablet to make the vehicle visible. Mr Chandrasekher said the public would be able to bring up the same real-time performance data as the racers' support teams, using the progam. 'Psychological impact' Formula E is scheduled to commence in September 2014 in London, with races to follow in nine other cities including Beijing and Los Angeles. Ten teams, each with two drivers, will compete against each other over the course of an hour. Mr Agag said he believed the events would appeal to a younger audience than that typically attracted to Formula 1, and he hoped many of the fans would end up becoming electric car owners. ""We think Formula E can be a platform where companies can showcase and develop and improve technologies for electric road cars,"" he said. ""We will demonstrate that batteries will offer more performance and go longer. At the beginning [the drivers] will swap cars, but this will stop as the batteries improve, and people will see the cars go faster. ""This, we hope, will have a psychological impact and make people more inclined to buy an electric car."" One independent automobile expert agreed the competition could prove influential. ""There's a perception issue with electric vehicles - people worry about how far they will go and the cost of the batteries,"" said Prof David Bailey, from Coventry Business School. ""This could show people how well they work. ""But a lot of other things need to happen including changes in government policy if there's to be the necessary investment in wireless charging and other infrastructure beyond the racetracks.""",Smartphone chipmaker Qualcomm has signed a sponsorship deal with the forthcoming Formula E championship.
"Gen Keith Alexander, whose appointment was made public on Wednesday, became known to the public after Mr Snowden blew the whistle on the agency's mass surveillance programs. A spokesman for Privacy International told the BBC the move was ""worrying"". The BBC has asked Amazon for comment. Hours after Gen Alexander's appointment was made public Mr Snowden took to Twitter to voice his concern. ""It turns out 'Hey Alexa' is short for 'Hey Keith Alexander,'"" he tweeted. ""Yes, the Keith Alexander personally responsible for the unlawful mass surveillance programs that caused a global scandal,"" he added. Last week, a US federal court ruled that the NSA's phone record surveillance, uncovered by Mr Snowden in 2013, was illegal. Gen Alexander suggested at the time that reporters should not have been allowed to report on the documents that were leaked by Mr Snowden. “I think it’s wrong that that newspaper reporters have all these documents, the 50,000-whatever they have and are selling them and giving them out as if these - you know it just doesn’t make sense,” he told the Verge in 2013. “We ought to come up with a way of stopping it,"" he added. 'We don't need another NSA' Edin Omanovic, advocacy director at Privacy International, said Amazon's decision to hire Gen Alexander was deeply concerning. ""Every day, big tech companies like Amazon make huge ethical decisions which affect people’s lives without any democratic accountability,"" he said. ""Clearly it is worrying that at the heart of this will now be someone who spent years defending secret data grabs which were later proved to be unlawful. We don’t need another NSA - even one with a privacy policy."" Mr Omanovic suggested the move could make it easier for Amazon to exercise its influence in the security market. ""Amazon now wants to corner in on the lucrative defence and security market - and with that the keys to the huge data stores held by governments. ""It is no secret that the key to this is hiring influential former public servants. The concentration of power that will arise from this is bad for people, bad for companies, and bad for societies,"" he added. Last year, it emerged that Amazon's Alexa was among a variety of smart voice assistants that had been sending voice recordings to human contractors for review. Amazon has since made it possible for consumers to opt-out of such reviews.",A former National Security Agency (NSA) chief who was in the post when the Edward Snowden scandal broke has joined Amazon's board as a director.
"By Stephen EvansBBC News, Seoul In the US, the comedian Stephen Colbert leant into the camera on the Late Show recently and said: ""I have a special message for anyone watching tonight's show on their Samsung Galaxy Note 7. 'Run for your lives!'"" Other comics had similar riffs of their own. Twitter is swirling with Galaxy Note 7 jokes. This was not meant to happen. The Note 7 was intended as Samsung's answer to Apple's iPhone 7. If the smartphone industry is really a branch of the fashion business, Apple is king of the catwalk. Its iPhone has an iconic image as an object of desire. But Samsung thought it was finally dispersing that almost mystical aura around the iPhone by producing phones of similar elegance. The Galaxy Note 7 was meant to be the elegant, cool rival, launched a full month before the iPhone 7 to gain an advantage over Apple. When the Samsung's Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge were unveiled, they got rave reviews for their sleek elegance and the sales followed. The Galaxy Note 7 was meant to consolidate that success and, sure enough, when it was unveiled it too got really good reviews. In May this year, new figures showed that Samsung had outsold Apple in the United States, Apple's back-yard. But a nice phone is nothing if it catches fire. Samsung, in its drive to extend battery life, overextended itself on the technology. There is a trade-off between the size and power of batteries on the one hand, and their capacity to catch fire on the other - bigger batteries with shorter-battery lives are less prone to fires than smaller ones. Obviously, Samsung didn't get the balance right. Samsung is part of the fabric of Korean society. Indeed, the country is sometimes called the Republic of Samsung. You can be born in a Samsung hospital, play in a Samsung amusement park, live in Samsung apartments and finish your days in a Samsung funeral parlour. The company's activities go from shipbuilding to insurance to electronics. It is the country's biggest company and its revenue accounts for a fifth of the South Korean economy. People are proud of it. Boys - or at least their parents - grow up with the dream of becoming a salaryman at Samsung. So a monumental mess-up (as two recalls and a cancellation of a product must surely be) might hurt national pride. And it will hurt Samsung's profits. Some 2.5 million Galaxy Note 7s were sold at the price of about $800 (£655). That total figure alone adds up to more than $2bn (£1.6bn) - not enough to bring the company down, but enough to hurt. And that's before they take account of the unquantifiable cost to the image of the brand. The monumental mess might also make people question whether Samsung is all its cracked up to be. It is the biggest chaebol (as these very Korean, family-owned-and-run conglomerates are called). Some politicians argue that they are sclerotic and ill-suited to nimble footwork in fast-changing markets. It may also make Samsung look again at its ways of production. It takes great pride in the fact that it makes its components itself. Unlike Apple, it doesn't outsource to factories in China and the rest of South-East Asia. The exploding batteries issue may make it review that policy - though it could be argued that making components in-house increases control over quality. And the monumental mess may prompt the question of who is in charge. Samsung's chairman, Lee Kun-hee, is a very sick man and nobody expects him to return to work. His son, Lee Jae-yong (often known as Jay Y Lee) will take over formally at some stage (of that there is no doubt - the son will rise). Critics of the Korean way of business say that the son is inexperienced and may not be the best person for a job he got by virtue of heredity. And there will no doubt be a resurrection of an ongoing debate about chaebols and whether they are too cosy with government and too contemptuous of the law. In 2008, Mr Lee senior was found guilty of tax evasion and financial wrongdoing. Police raided his home to investigate allegations that Samsung was bribing influential prosecutors, judges and politicians. He was given a suspended sentence and the country's president pardoned him a few months later. All these questions may come to the fore. This row is not just about a smartphone.",You know your product's got problems when it becomes the subject of jokes on late-night television.
"Last month Apple was found guilty of conspiring with publishers to fix the price of e-books bought via iTunes. It was ordered to terminate deals with five major companies and allow other e-book retailers to sell to iPad and iPhone users for the next two years. The publishers say they are being punished by the restrictions. Under agreements put in place between Apple and companies including Hatchett and Macmillan, electronic book price-fixing took place, creating unfair competition for other retailers, the court ruled last month. At the time most of the publishers reached separate settlements totalling more than $150m (£96m) but Apple said it would fight the ""false allegations"". According to the Associated Press news agency, the publishers' complaint says: ""The provisions do not impose any limitation on Apple's pricing behaviour at all. ""Rather, under the guise of punishing Apple, they effectively punish [publishers that settled in the case]."" Garner analyst Van Baker told AP that the ruling seemed ""heavy-handed"". ""It is basically putting a stake through a portion of Apple's business, and I confess to being surprised by that,"" he said. ""It strikes me as a pretty heavy-handed solution to the issue.""","HarperCollins, Simon & Shuster and Penguin are among publishers who have filed a complaint against restrictions imposed on Apple by a US court."
"By Zoe ThomasTechnology reporter The move was announced following a series of leaks during the game's development. Warzone will be free to play across gaming platforms including Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and PCs. In battle royale games multiple players can fight and explore a game together, but ultimately the goal is to be the last player standing. Games like Fortnite and Apex Legends helped popularise the genre. Analysts say Call of Duty: Warzone will offer ""something fresh"" in the gaming world, particularly as a growing number of people watch livestream gaming. ""What Call of Duty: Warzone brings to the table is a triple threat since it's tied to a very popular franchise,"" said Doron Nir, chief executive of livestreaming services provider StreamElements. ""There hasn't been a big new battle royale game in a while, and it's free-to-play."" Activision released a battle royale game in 2018, but players had to purchase Call of Duty: Black Ops for $60 (£46) to access it. Analysts say the industry has shifted more to a free to play model and this move by Activision should be concerning to some competitors. ""This is forward-thinking and a step in the right direction,"" said Will Hershey chief executive of Round Hill Investments. Mr Hershey said games like Apex Legends and PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) are most exposed because their players and players of the Call of Duty franchise tend to be older. Fortnite, by comparison, has less gore and younger players. In Warzone up to 150 players will be able to participate in a single battle. For context, Fortnite has 100 and Apex Legends allows 60. Players will compete in teams of three. Leaks during the development suggested a single game could have up to 200 players. It takes place in the city of Verdansk, which will be familiar to players of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare released last year. The game's map is also large, with 300 points of interests. Gamers will be able to save their positions and restart on different consoles allowing players to maintain their progression in the game. Players will be able to earn in-game cash to buy upgrades, gear and tokens that can revive them or their teammates from death. Though Warzone will be a standalone game, purchasers of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare will be able to transfer contents like skins - customized avatar looks - and equipment. While Call of Duty: Warzone is free, analysts explain the company still intends to make money from it. Warzone is intended for mature players who typically have greater spending power. ""Most game companies wouldn't invest in a game of this scope if profit wasn't a key driver,"" said Mr Nir. Players will be able to make in-game purchases to upgrade their characters or tools. There is also the potential to build interest in the Call of Duty franchise among new players who may then buy the box edition. The timing of Warzone's release seems to be linked to leaks of the game on YouTube. But the game could also benefit from the coronavirus outbreak and the global quarantines. ""Any kind of stay at home entertainment companies has a potential to benefit from this,"" said Mr Hershey. Viewers of livestream gaming spiked in China in February as large parts of the country were put under quarantine.","US game developer Activision is releasing Call of Duty: Warzone, its new battle royale game, on Tuesday."
"By Dave LeeTechnology reporter, BBC News Popcorn Time allows free access to movies by streaming content shared illegally as BitTorrent files. Its makers said they were closing the ""experimental"" service, but other developers have begun working on it. One analyst described the software as a ""nightmare scenario"" for the movie industry. The software, which launched last week, has been made open-source and posted on a popular code-sharing website. This means that anyone is now free to use, adapt and, crucially, host the software - making it more difficult to close down. It also means that while the original Popcorn Time makers decided to ""close"" the service at the end of last week, it has now essentially taken on a life of its own. It has been translated into 32 different languages. 'Decentralised model' Popcorn Time lists thousands of movies that can be viewed instantly. It is powered by BitTorrent files - a typical way of downloading movies - but with an interface that makes it far easier for non-technically-minded people to navigate. Mark Mulligan, an analyst and co-founder of Midia Consulting, said this should give content creators great cause of concern. ""The next stage of piracy, and one rights holders need to be really worried about, is when the pirates start behaving like the rest of the internet and start making great user experiences."" Popcorn Time requires the user to download a small program to their computer in order to access the content. Upon installation, users are warned that viewing films in this way could be illegal in their country. ""Popcorn Time doesn't host any copyrighted content, the app is based in a decentralised model, working with services that already exist and are used daily by millions of people worldwide,"" the makers, who have remained anonymous but said they were based in Buenos Aires, explained on their website. ""We aren't making any money or accepting donations with the project at the time, as we keep to our original intentions of just focusing Popcorn Time on a technology experiment to bring a simpler way to experience movies in a digital environment."" In a follow-up blog post, the makers criticised the film industry for placing unnecessary restrictions on streaming around the world. ""Take Argentina for example,"" they wrote. ""Streaming providers seem to believe that There's Something About Mary is a recent movie. That movie would be old enough to vote here."" 'Harming livelihoods' No prominent group representing copyright holders has said publicly that it was taking action, but several have raised concern about Popcorn Time. ""What is clear is that there are people that want to push the boundaries of technology and testing the law out,"" said Eddy Leviten, director of communications at the UK-based Federation Against Copyright Theft (Fact). ""What we would say is that the law is quite clearly defined as to what is copyright infringement and what isn't. ""These people are seeking to avoid paying the content creators, the owners of the content. By doing that they're harming the livelihoods of people who work in the creative industries."" The Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), told the BBC it was aware of the service but did not wish to comment as it did not discuss potential future litigation. Analyst Mr Mulligan said the new challenge for content creators, particularly the film industry, was to look again at how it released new titles - and to prioritise the internet audience. ""The main solution for movies would be to treat the likes of Hulu, Netflix, or any movie service, as a tier-one window,"" he told the BBC. ""It's where your most valuable engaged customers are. Blu-Ray and DVDs are the dying segment.""

"By Sophia Smith GalerBBC News It is the first time a major social-media platform has blocked private messaging by teenagers, on a global scale. A survey by UK regulator Ofcom suggested TikTok was used by 13% of 12- to 15-year-olds last year. Critics say the new rules will not stop children lying about their age online. 'Bold move' Until now, all users have been able to send direct messages to others, when both accounts follow each other. The change means those under the age of 16 will no longer be able to communicate privately on the platform under any circumstances. They will still be able to post publicly in the comments sections of videos. TikTok says those affected will receive an in-app notification soon and will lose access to direct messages on 30 April. The limit is based on the date of birth added to the account when it is created - but no verification takes place and the system is based on trust. In 2018, Facebook introduced rules to make WhatsApp available to over-16s only across the EU, to adhere to its General Data Protection Regulation. ""The interesting thing here is that TikTok's biggest group of users are teenagers,"" said social-media consultant Matt Navarra. ""This restriction will impact a large number of their core demographic. ""Also, blocking use of a core feature such as messaging between its biggest sub-set of users is bold move."" But Mr Navarra added: ""Depending on how cynical you are, you could view this as TikTok following the same strategy as Facebook and others, whereby they launch new 'digital wellbeing' or safety features in advance of any potential regulatory hearings or investigations. ""It gives these platforms something to fight back with. ""It's possible TikTok has observed some concerning incidents or activity on the platform and is now trying to get ahead of the issue with this new restriction."" NSPCC child safety online policy head Andy Burrows said: ""This is a bold move by TikTok as we know that groomers use direct messaging to cast the net widely and contact large numbers of children. ""Offenders are taking advantage of the current climate to target children spending more time online. ""But this shows proactive steps can be taken to make sites safer and frustrate groomers from being able to exploit unsafe design choices. ""It's time tech firms did more to identify which of their users are children and make sure they are given the safest accounts by default."" 'Tell fibs' British Children's Charities' Coalition on Internet Safety secretary John Carr said: ""It's good that TikTok are showing an awareness of these issues but without having any meaningful way of checking children's ages it's a lot less than it appears to be."" He said research ""when Facebook was the dominant app amongst children"" had suggested in some countries about 80% of children above the age of eight had a Facebook account - with the proportion at about two-thirds in the UK. ""No-one's done it specifically for TikTok but all the evidence that we have shows there are gigantic numbers of under-age children on the site,"" he said. ""We all know children tell fibs. ""If all the older cool kids are on, that's where you want to be. ""It's potentially dangerous because parents might allow children to go on an app believing that age means something, and it doesn't, because they never check.""",New rules on the hugely popular TikTok app mean under-16s will no longer be allowed to send or receive direct messages.
"By Natalio Cosoy BBC Mundo ""I wanted to help, but I didn't want to find myself in the awkward position of having to ask for repayment should things not work out,"" Mr Lahoud, a former finance professional now based in New York, told BBC Mundo. Eventually Mr Lahoud decided to provide the funding his friend needed, and in return ask him to share any future earnings. It meant that if his friend did not succeed, Mr Lahoud would receive nothing. ""I felt that as a backer, I had a financial incentive, a social impact and a human-to-human connection with the person I was backing... which made this feel much more interesting than any other type of funding an individual could seek,"" he said. Mr Lahoud was so pleased with the arrangement he decided to pursue it further - and together with his partner Oren Bass, they launched Pave in December 2012. Pave is a crowd-funding website where investors (or backers, as they call them) fund individuals in the belief that they will become successful in the future. They mainly invest in recent graduates and young professionals. Pave is not the first of its kind. A few months earlier David Girouard, a former Google employee, launched Upstart, which provides a similar service. In Pave and Upstart the investor's money goes directly to support individuals, who commit to paying back a percentage of their pre-tax income for 10 years (up to 7% per year in Upstart and 8% in Pave). Once that time passes, the relationship between investor and debtor is over. And if during a certain period the debtors do not earn enough, they do not pay. It is known as a ""human capital contract"", and Upstart's Mr Girouard believes it came along at just the right time. ""Student debt and other financial obligations, coupled with lack of access to capital, drive young people to forgo their preferred career path and to accept boring jobs that will allow them to meet their financial obligations,"" he told BBC Mundo. ""This isn't good for them. Nor is it good for our economy."" Sam Wilson, who is a backer in Pave, thinks the model is sustainable because: ""If people do what they love for a living they are more likely to be successful."" And Andy Palmer, who has invested in more than 20 people on Upstart, is convinced that these sorts of services help him successfully diversify his investment. ""The money that I'm putting into Upstarts is money that otherwise I would expect to put into relatively conservative financial instruments,"" said Mr Palmer. On Kickstarter's path Upstart and Pave have followed in the footsteps of Kickstarter, which provides a crowd-sourcing platform for the development of new products. Pave's and Upstart's profiles look a lot like a hybrid between a Kickstarter page and a profile from the professionally-oriented social network Linkedin. Those looking for funding can provide details about their academic and work experience, as well as skills and a photograph. Another similarity with Kickstarter is that the offer to invest is opened for a certain amount of time and if the full amount is not reached, the ""prospect"" (as these sites call them) goes home empty-handed. Upstart actively evaluates the people seeking funds - Mr Girouard says his experience in staff selection in Google helped him understand how to decide whether someone is worth an investment. ""By identifying and measuring somebody's potential; you allow them to monetise it,"" he said. His website also verifies that the investors are allowed to lend money. Pave takes more of a hands-off approach, although it does check that both parties are acting in good faith and that the investors are operating within the regulation. In both cases that means that they have to be vouched for by the US financial authorities where they currently operate. Small community There are many other online peer-to-peer financing websites. Lumni provides a human capital contract service for students in the US, Mexico, Chile and Colombia, while Vittana and Enzi are also aimed at students. Kiva seeks to provide funding to entrepreneurs from the developing world. In comparison the Pave and Upstart communities still feel fairly small. The backers I talked with were all linked to the company founders - and together both sites have funded about 50 people so far. Their big challenge now is to get larger. Mr Girouard admits that they need to ""bring sufficient capital to the platform to meet the huge demand that we're seeing"". And Pave's Mr Lahoud wants ""prospects coming to the site for funding (to) have a positive experience"". ""We recognise that Pave might not be for everyone,"" adds his partner, Mr Bass. Londoner Marina Peluffo is an active investor in Kickstarter. She says she is not attracted by human capital contracts. She told BBC Mundo: ""What's distinctive about the projects I have supported (through Kickstarter) is that the exchange is clear - if you are a backer, after a certain amount of months you will receive a product you are interested in."" Ms Peluffo finds human capital contracts less attractive because they are ""a long-term investment"". She values Kickstarter's model because it gives her access to ""an innovative product"" that she would not be able to get hold of otherwise. Regulation and payment There is another potentially problematic element - regulation. ""There's always a risk with any concept that doesn't fall neatly into existing regulations,"" said Mr Girouard. Similar initiatives have in the past clashed against the current legal framework. Prosper.com, provider of peer-to-peer lending services, got into trouble with the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission, the US financial regulator) in 2006. Only after modifying the way it operated was it allowed to resume its services. And the British website Zopa faced similar issues with Italy's Central Bank. In 2009 it had to stop offering loans in the country. Mr Bass, however, is optimistic: ""While Pave has neither sought nor received an endorsement from any regulatory agency, we are confident based on our interactions with them that they want new products like Pave's to be available to consumers."" Mr Girouard is similarly upbeat: ""The response (from the regulators) thus far has been quite positive."" In any case, both sites have already managed to get loans to prospects and upstarts and, in some cases, they are already paying money back. But what if they stop paying? Pave will first approach a non-complying prospect to check what is going on. If they find the payments have been stopped without proper justification, they will do the same as any collecting agency and seek to recover the money owed. Andy Palmer, the Upstart backer, said he has not yet needed to use this specific service. ""They've already started paying me back and it hasn't even been a full year since I started backing,"" he said. ""If I get returns that are anything better than bonds, which isn't much right now, I'll be more than happy,"" he said. ""That's because I not only got my money back but I also empowered a young person to follow his or her passion and take risks."" This article is based on a feature originally published on the BBC Mundo website",A couple of years ago a friend of Sal Lahoud asked for some money to help him start up a new venture that he was particularly passionate about.
"The rival handset-tablet hybrids have contrasting designs. Huawei's Mate X places its fold-out screen on the outside of the device, so that it covers the front and rear of the phone when closed. In both modes, the display is larger than Samsung's. Huawei's device is also flatter and thinner when shut. However, unlike Samsung's Galaxy Fold it does not have a second display on its reverse side. One analyst attending the launch event in Barcelona also remarked that a crease in the screen appeared to be visible. The Chinese company allowed attendees at the event to get a close look at the handset following its unveiling. Its South Korean competitor has yet to let outsiders to do so with the Galaxy Fold. ""Security concerns about Huawei's 5G kit are a shadow hanging over the whole of this year's Mobile World Congress,"" commented the BBC's technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones. ""But the firm was determined in a confident, even arrogant press conference to convey that it's now the leading innovator in smartphones."" For comparison's sake, Huawei said: Unlike the Fold, the Mate X does not place any of its cameras on the same side as its screen when unfolded. Instead they are placed on the flipside of the device on a strip that also features a fingerprint sensor. This runs down the side of the smaller of the two folded displays when closed and doubles up as a side-grip when open. This potentially places the Mate X at a disadvantage to the Fold, since it becomes impossible to use its unfolded screen to take selfies. However, it is not yet clear whether this will be a serious consideration in practice. However, the Mate X's advantage is that it does not have a ""notch"" cut into its screen as a consequence. 5G connections Huawei said the Mate X would come with one of its existing 5G modems and could download a one gigabyte movie in as little as three seconds if a fast enough connection was available. Like Samsung's device, it also features a battery on each of its two sides, but claims to be able to recharge more quickly. ""Both foldable phones are 5G-capable and are instantly distinctive from the smartphone designs of the last 10 years,"" commented Ian Fogg, an analyst at the mobile analytics company Opensignal. ""But 5G is arriving on regular designed smartphones too, at lower prices, and more quickly. ""Because of that, more people will experience the benefits of 5G this year than the novelty of an expanding smartphone display."" The Mate X has been priced to start at 2,299 euros ($2,600; £1996) and is due to go on sale from the middle of this year. That compares to the $1,980 figure quoted by Samsung, although once taxes are taken into account the gap should be smaller. Huawei's consumer devices chief Richard Yu acknowledged that the price was ""very expensive"" but said he hoped it would be reduced over time. Analysis: Zoe Kleinman, Technology reporter, Barcelona There were claps and cheers as Richard Yu finally unveiled Huawei's latest masterpiece after three years in development - the folding phone. And the hits just kept on coming: its split-screen function, its dimensions - gleefully compared to those of the iPhone and Galaxy Fold - even a protective case got its own round of applause. However, the biggest gasps came right at the end - when he announced the price tag. At 2,299 euros, even the hardcore enthusiasts appeared to wince. Everybody who charged to the demonstration area afterwards was disappointed as the handsets remained frustratingly behind Perspex. Still, the Mate X has still done enough to secure its ""wow factor"" at MWC. But that price and Huawei's wider controversies threaten to act as a deterrent to even deep-pocketed early adopters. Zoom in Two other Chinese companies have also unveiled new handsets ahead of Monday's start of the Mobile World Congress trade show. Oppo has showed off a handset with a 10x optical zoom. Unlike digital zooms, there is no loss of quality as the shot tightens in. The three cameras involved do not need to extend from the phone to achieve this. Instead, the device features a periscope-like system inside its chassis. This lets it range between focal lengths of 16mm and 160mm. The innovation builds on an earlier prototype, which was never put into production, that offered a 5x zoom. However, the design means the handset is by necessity thicker than most rivals. In addition, the company announced it would soon launch 5G handsets in Australia, Singapore, Switzerland and China. Xiaomi also held a press conference where it revealed its forthcoming flagship Mi 9 handset will cost 449 euros when it launches in Europe. It features three rear cameras, one of which offers 48 megapixel resolution. In addition, the firm said it intended to launch a 5G handset - the Mi Mix 3 5G - costing 599 euros, which is likely to be one of the lowest-cost models to be compatible with next-generation networks. However, a demo of the firm's smart home technology fell flat after a series of attempts to show off voice-controlled commands failed.","Huawei has revealed its first smartphone to feature a foldable screen, less than a week after its rival Samsung did the same."
"If a user selected a negative emotion from Facebook's list of feelings in a status update then the ""like"" button would change to ""sympathise"". A Facebook engineer said at a company event that the button had been created as part of an internal project. But he later went on to say there were no plans to launch it at the moment. Facebook were holding a ""compassion research day"" where members of the public and researchers are invited along to ""improve [Facebook's] understanding of the driving forces and benefits of compassion"". Hackathon In a question and answer session an audience member asked if Facebook had thought about changing the ""like"" button when it felt inappropriate in relation to what a user had posted, for example when someone had written that their parents had died. Dan Muriello, a software engineer at Facebook, said another engineer had worked on a hackathon project ""a while back"" to change the ""like"" button to ""sympathise"". It would not work for every post he said but if you tag a status with certain emotions from a fixed list then the ""like"" button would change. ""A lot of people were very excited. But we made a decision that it was not exactly the right time to launch that product. Yet,"" he said. Facebook hackathons are events where the company's engineers get together and brainstorm new ideas. Facebook Chat and the ""friend suggester"" facility both were developed from work at these events.","Facebook has devised a ""sympathise"" button as an alternative to the ""like"" button for use in certain situations."
"Dell's software checks in with the domain periodically, so whoever snapped it up could use it to distribute malware. Security expert and author Brian Krebs - who first reported the issue - believed there was a possibility that this had happened. Dell says no malware was transferred. Dell's Backup and Recovery Application software is installed by default on many of the firm's PCs and allows users to restore their computers to factory settings, in the event of problems. The software downloaded updates from dellbackupandrecoverycloudstorage.com. That web address used to be controlled by US-based tech firm SoftThinks, but was taken over by another party at some point between June and July this year. ""Approximately two weeks after Dell's contractor lost control over the domain, the server it was hosted on started showing up in malware alerts,"" Mr Krebs said in his blog. In a statement, Dell admitted it had lost control of the domain name but said the problem had been ""addressed"". Dell said: ""We do not believe that the Dell Backup and Recovery calls to the URL during the period in question resulted in the transfer of information to or from the site, including the transfer of malware to any user device.""

"By Chris FoxxTechnology reporter Customers will also be able to add accounts from 21 rivals including Lloyds and NatWest, to keep track of all their balances in one app. The app will be trialled with 10,000 customers before launching in 2018. Similar money-tracking features have proved popular for smaller start-up banks such as Monzo, and ING's Yolt. Those apps let people break down their spending into easily visible categories such as groceries, entertainment, coffee and utility bills. The same feature will be added to HSBC Beta. ""The challenger banks are offering new user interfaces and experiences, and very intuitive design features, so they're much more attractive to younger people,"" said Markos Zachariadis, associate professor at Warwick Business School. ""The traditional large institutions are not as flexible when innovating and developing new solutions, but they will get there. It's something that every bank will have to do."" The ability to add rival bank accounts to one app is part of an initiative called Open Banking, which will make it easier for banks, start-ups and other financial institutions to share data when customers request it. The HSBC Beta app will also let people set personal goals, such as spending less money on coffee. It can then give people ""helpful nudges"" if they spend too much, said HSBC UK's head of personal banking, Becky Moffat. ""What customers told us they want, is the ability to see all their money in one place and have helpful nudges and tools,"" she told the BBC. Ms Moffat acknowledged that smaller challenger banks were already offering apps with similar features, while the new HSBC app will not be widely available until ""early 2018"". ""We've seen the likes of Monzo and Yolt, now we want to leverage the trust people have in the HSBC brand so they don't need multiple apps. ""Our legacy systems are not always the easiest to integrate with, and sometimes we have to spend more energy to deliver what our customers want in this day and age. ""We need to make sure we are doing it right and being robust in what we are offering, so when we do take it to market, we know it's what our customers want.""","HSBC UK is testing a new smartphone app that will help people track what they spend money on, and will ""nudge"" them if they exceed their spending limits."
"By Zoe ThomasBBC Business reporter, New York At the Consensus 2016 conference in New York, attendees told the BBC they wanted to see more proof before they would be ready to believe the claims. Mr Wright spoke to the BBC claiming he created the crypto-currency. Gavin Andresen, chief scientist at the Bitcoin Foundation, has confirmed the claim. Noisy method Mr Andresen said he travelled to London to meet Mr Wright who showed him proof that he and Satoshi Nakamoto - the pseudonym adopted by Bitcoin's creator - were one and the same. ""He signed in my presence using the private key from block one, the very first mined Bitcoin block, on a computer that I am convinced had not been tampered with,"" he said. Each key is a unique digital code that is linked to specific bitcoins. But even he added: ""It is impossible to prove something like that 100%."" Scepticism about Mr Wright's claim has been fuelled by following the steps he put on his blog that, he said, show how to go about verifying cryptographic keys. Some queried the complicated series of steps in this process and the information they called upon. Security expert Dan Kaminsky said the process was ""maliciously resistant"" to validation. Mr Andresen said he could not explain why Mr Wright had chosen such a ""funky"" procedure as a proof. Others at the Consensus conference were more openly sceptical. Vitalik Buterin, from the blockchain company Ethereum, said the very ""noisy"" way in which Mr Wright chose to make this announcement threw into question whether it was true. ""In general, signal theory says if you have a good way of proving something and a noisy way of proving something and you choose the noisy way chances are it's because you couldn't do the good way in the first place."" Eric Voorhees, founder of cryptocurrency trading app ShapeShift, also had his doubts. ""I generally trust Gavin [Anderseen]'s opinions so I want to believe this but I'm not convinced yet,"" he said. Others were more willing to believe that the elusive Bitcoin creator had finally been revealed. ""I think it would be good news if Satoshi Nakamoto is found,"" said Daniel Lipshitz, from bitcoin infrastructure company Gap 600. He said while public proof from Mr Wright would be good, he trusted Mr Andresen and was willing to believe that he had seen compelling evidence. Moving on The digital currency industry is still developing. It has moved from the shady criminal underworld it was first associated with. Bitcoin, and the underlying blockchain technology it is based on, are now being invested in by the finance industry looking for the next place for innovation. ""It's not clear to me that if Craig Wright is Satoshi, or if it's someone else, that this is relevant to Bitcoin these days,"" said Dr Garrick Hileman, an economic historian at the London School of Economics, who has studied the genesis of the digital currency. ""Some would argue that we are now living in a post-Satoshi world,"" he said. ""But I think Satoshi does matter, we should not dismiss their contribution."" However, he added, sessions at the Consensus conference and events in the wider world showed how the focus on the technology had shifted. Many financial firms were now looking at the blockchain that underlies bitcoin as a way to solve and streamline some long-standing payment processing problems. ""The industry has moved,"" he said. ""The investment and interest is going into more and more non-currency uses.""",Members of the Bitcoin community remain sceptical about Craig Wright's claim to be the mysterious creator of the digital currency.
"The trials will take place in California and Arizona, according to Waymo chief executive John Krafcik. Modified Chrysler Pacificas with Waymo-designed sensors were on display at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, where Mr Krafcik spoke. One tech analyst said the industry would keenly watch Waymo's performance in the coming months. Waymo plans to develop self-driving technology and provide it to established carmakers. The company was formally launched by Google in December. Mr Krafcik said the company had managed to reduce the cost of producing its Lidar laser-based sensor, though did not give details about how, according to Associated Press. He added that he expected Waymo to have completed three million miles of test-driving by May.

"The case centres around images people uploaded to Facebook that were later used to help identify them in other pictures. This led Facebook users in Illinois to allege that the service had not got permission to use images in this way. The decision means their class action lawsuit can now go ahead. Unique harm The social network had sought to defuse the legal claims by trying to convince the court that each user's claim was unique and required its own lawsuit. The San Francisco court unanimously rejected this and said those suing Facebook had suffered ""sufficient privacy injuries"" to allow them to sue as a group. The lawsuit alleges that Facebook did not do enough to warn people it would be collecting detailed images of their faces and that it did not get their explicit consent to do so. ""This biometric data is so sensitive that if it is compromised, there is simply no recourse,"" said lawyer Shawn Williams who is acting for the group. ""It's not like a Social Security card or credit card number where you can change the number. You can't change your face."" The class action has also won support from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) which has taken a strong stance against the growing use of facial recognition data. The ACLU said such recognition systems had the potential to do ""unique privacy harms"". ""This decision is a strong recognition of the dangers of unfettered use of face surveillance technology,"" ACLU staff attorney Nathan Wessler said in a statement. The legal action began in 2015 with a claim Facebook had broken Illinois laws limiting the collection of biometric data. If the class action court case succeeds, Facebook could end up paying substantial damages. The Illinois law levies fees of $1,000 (£826) for each ""negligent violation"" of its biometrics laws and $5,000 for each ""reckless"" violation. Millions of users could be included in the class action, said Reuters, potentially leading to a massive payout. Facebook said it planned to appeal against the decision. It added: ""We have always disclosed our use of face recognition technology and that people can turn it on or off at any time."" Facial recognition technology is coming under increasing scrutiny by regulators and governments. In the UK, MPs have said it should stop being used and the Information Commissioner said it raised ""significant"" privacy issues.",A US court has thrown out an attempt by Facebook to stop legal action over the way it collected images of people's faces.
"UK authorities said a hack in April 2011 ""could have been prevented"". The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) criticised the entertainment giant for not having up-to-date security software. Sony told the BBC it ""strongly disagreed"" with the ruling and planned to appeal. ""Criminal attacks on electronic networks are a real and growing aspect of 21st century life and Sony continually works to strengthen our systems, building in multiple layers of defence and working to make our networks safe, secure and resilient,"" a spokesman for the firm added. The company had previously apologised for the hack which saw its PlayStation Network knocked offline for several days. In May 2011 company executives bowed in public and offered users free games to show their remorse. 'Not good enough' The ICO's report said technical developments had led to user passwords not being secure - leaving data such as names, addresses, dates of birth and payment card information at risk. ""If you are responsible for so many payment card details and log-in details then keeping that personal data secure has to be your priority,"" said David Smith, deputy commissioner and director of data protection at the ICO. ""In this case that just didn't happen, and when the database was targeted - albeit in a determined criminal attack - the security measures in place were simply not good enough."" Since the hack, which angered gamers who wanted to play over 2011's Easter weekend, Sony has said it has rebuilt the PlayStation Network system to be more secure. But the ICO said the fine reflected the severity of the security lapse, adding that it was among the most serious it had ever seen. ""There's no disguising that this is a business that should have known better,"" Mr Smith added. ""It is a company that trades on its technical expertise, and there's no doubt in my mind that they had access to both the technical knowledge and the resources to keep this information safe."" One positive from the hack, Mr Smith said, was that polls conducted after the breach suggested a greater awareness of the risks in handing over personal data.","Sony Computer Entertainment Europe has been fined £250,000 ($396,100) following a ""serious breach"" of the Data Protection Act."
"By Leo KelionTechnology reporter The previous model won high scores and plaudits, including T3 magazine's Gadget of the Year award and the GSM Association's Best Smartphone prize at Barcelona's Mobile World Congress. But it failed to sell in the numbers the Taiwanese firm hoped for, helping contribute to its first ever quarterly loss last year. The new model is a bit bigger, louder and long lasting than before and adds a sensor on its back that lets it refocus photos after they are taken, among other visual effects. But the main camera's sensor remains unchanged. So, what did the net make of the new model, the HTC One (M8)? The Verge The new One, also known as the M8, is better than last year's already impressive model in almost every respect: the design has been refined, it has a bigger battery, the processor is faster, the camera has new tricks, and the software has been made friendlier... It could carve out a comfortable third-place position behind Samsung and Apple. But third place can be dangerous: with Apple and Samsung eating up the lion's share of profits in the smartphone world. Engadget The biggest problem with the M8 is that it doesn't raise the bar much higher than it already is - and that's going to make it difficult to stand apart from competing devices like the Galaxy S5. Yes, Samsung's upcoming flagship is an iterative improvement as well, but for better or worse, the company will still sell millions of units while HTC's success remains uncertain. Cnet I recommend the One M8 if a clean and engaging software experience is what you value... But if snapping sharp pictures (and water-resistance) is your ultimate goal, then you'll want to wait the Galaxy S5 or opt for the Sony Xperia Z2 instead. Wired Of all the specs, the cameras are the only bring-downs. HTC didn't beef up the rear camera. It's the same 4.1-megapixel shooter as last year's, although HTC did add a second lens to the backside to help it achieve some effects. The front-facing camera has also been upped to five megapixels, but despite that fact, when I used it to shoot video, it looked pretty bad. Pocket-lint HTC has continued to push camera innovation and should be commended for committing to something that's different, even if its success rate isn't 100%. This isn't about pushing megapixels, it's about unlocking new functionality which can be effective and about thinking differently. Techradar If the HTC One (M8) isn't the smartphone of 2014, I'm very, very excited to see what the competition will come up with as this handset strikes the perfect blend of design, performance and innovation without really compromising in any area. Twitter: Battery life is 40 percent longer on the new HTC One. Companies are taking battery life seriously this year. @SoldierKnowBest HTC's CEO just said new smartphone's camera is ""optimized for selfies."" Shark officially jumped. @crayton_h The HTC One M8 is a damn gorgeous phone @Michael_J28 Opening up the camera API [application programming interface] to third party development? Only going to make the camera better. Smart. @AshleyEsqueda U put a larger display on the device and dropped the PPI [pixels per inch] - who does that? U guys were leaders in the display game past tense. @2FaceTouch Facebook: HTC never disappoints me, that is what a SMARTphone should be exactly! John Chang HTC One (M8) nice design but when comparing the specs to other phones am really disappointed. Karan NG Once you feel the ""brushed metal unibody frame"" of HTC One you never go back to PLASTIC phone! William Koh As a former T-Mobile Quality Mgr, I felt HTC products were hands down better than Samsung's, but the marketing side was super weak in comparison!!! HTC if you want to compete against the big boys, you have to dig deeper into your pocket books! To the corporate offices in Taoyuan, Taiwan... are you listening!? Lily Weems Still 4 megapixel/ultrapixel cam. And seriously 2600mh batt? Ow come on htc. You can do better than that. Mark Benedict Dela Paz Reddit: Well it seems that they just keep adding all sorts of features instead of actually focusing on good quality. The reason the iPhone gets such good camera reviews for example is because you can just go into the camera and take good pictures without playing with all sorts of settings. Bigsam411 The [Sony] Z2 is the same size but also has front-facing speakers, a bigger screen, more RAM, and is waterproof. And a camera that belongs in a flagship phone of 2014. I keep thinking of going back to HTC for my next phone but I want a great camera, so they're not making it easy. Zentaurion First reviews are up and everything but the camera is praised again. What are they doing there? Just buy the best sensor on the market and stick in there, they need to stop being so tricky. c3vzn This is insane. The phone is announced and released same day and reviews are popping up. I used to think only Apple could do this. HTC has seriously impressed me and if I did not already have a Nexus 5 I would consider buying this. Bigsam411 Almost sold on the M8, but I'm coming from a [Samsung Galaxy] Note 2 and need multi-window support or just a way to run two apps at once without one going to sleep. S1ayer I hope they stay in business. It just takes time for people to learn about awesome companies. HTC has low name recognition, but I hope they can build it up and become an established premium smartphone player. awkward",Most of the details of HTC's latest phone had leaked out in advance of its official launch in London and New York. But maybe that's a good thing - at this point the firm could do with all the publicity it can get.
"By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter It might sound cool to marketers, but consumers are increasingly questioning just how clever these devices really are. Now, cities are jumping on the bandwagon and giving themselves the same title whenever they implement technology solutions. For some, that involves flashy and expensive command-and-control centres from which they view traffic flow and data collected from sensors around the city. Sweden's capital, Stockholm, has taken a different, quieter approach, but, along the way, has garnered over seven million euros (£5.9m) of EU money and become a leading example of how to do ""smart"". It has been designated as an EU ""lighthouse"" city - alongside Barcelona and Cologne - meaning the projects it implements, if successful, can then be copied in other European towns. Stockholm's interpretation of smart is about becoming greener - it hopes to be fossil-fuel free by 2040 and sees eco-policies as the smartest thing not only for the city but for the planet. Stockholm is already pretty eco-friendly. Bio-fuel, generated from sewage, is available at petrol stations around the city, and regularly used by taxis and cars. And now, the city wants to extend its use to larger vans and lorries, which are particularly polluting, and explore ways to make the fuel more efficient. ""One hundred people going to the toilet powers one car, but if we add organic household waste, that goes down to 60 people,"" said Gustaf Landahl, who heads up the Grow Smarter project. The smart cities which never sleep The future of a good night out Are our cites killing us with bad air? What it feels like to fly a jetpack Read all of the BBC's Tomorrow's Cities season here Stockholm is also working with energy company Fortum to take advantage of a city-wide heating system, to use waste heat generated from data centres, supermarkets and stadiums to provide heat for residents around the city. The fact the city has a network of underground pipes - which comprises 2,800km of piping connected to around 10,000 buildings in the city - means that waste heat - in the form of hot water - can easily be added to the grid. In another project, the city plans to re-use wasted heat from a 30,000-seater stadium in a nearby development of houses, shops and restaurants. Another deal has just been reached, with data centre GleSys, which will see recovered heat able to serve the heating needs of more than 1,000 flats. There is a trend for technology companies, under pressure to make their data centres greener, to relocate to colder countries. In 2013, Facebook opened a data centre in the remote northern Swedish town of Lulea. But not everyone is convinced this was really that green. ""In Sweden's cold climate heat has value. Selling and reusing the data centre waste heat for residential heating is sustainable as well as profitable. Therefore you should not put your data centre in the woods where the heat can't be recovered,"" said Fortum's head of open district heating, Erik Rylander. ""That Facebook data centre could have heated 90,000 homes if it had been located where the heat could be re-used"" Now, Stockholm is actively campaigning to persuade technology businesses to locate their data centres to the capital. The city also has the world's largest open-fibre network, which provides cheap city-wide fast broadband to most residents, who pay about 20 to 25 euros per month for a 1GB service. Now, that network is also helping support sensors around the city, seen by many as the best way of measuring what is going on in the urban environment. This will begin on a small scale in a neglected area of the city, which will be transformed by 2025 into a trendy revitalised zone, with homes, shops and restaurants. The area will boast smart bus-stops offering information, wi-fi access and sensors that measure traffic flow and air quality. It would, said Mika Hakosalo the site manager for Stockholm's environment administration, help the city understand how its citizens moved around. ""Our target in GrowSmarter is to reduce the transport emissions by 60%, so we will use the data to understand underlying factors affecting the transport emissions in a given area to be able to find and test solutions to reduce them."" The city is creating several eco-districts made up of new-builds as well as retro-fitted older buildings. All are being made as environmentally friendly and heat-efficient as possible - with the use of innovative insulation schemes and solar-panels on roofs. Mr Landahl said it was important citizens were at the centre of any changes. ""We have to improve the quality of life, we can't just work with technology for technology's sake,"" he said. ""We are building energy-efficient buildings, but we need to make people who live there energy-efficient too,"" Changing user behaviour is starting in small steps. On one newly built privately owned estate, residents are provided with tablets that show their real-time energy usage in an attempt to make them better understand how they use and waste gas, water and electricity. As well as seeing their light, heat and water consumption in real-time, residents can also track their usage over a period of time, see the best times to run appliances and compare their usage with that of their neighbours. Meanwhile, on a public housing estate - built in the 1960s and in desperate need of renovation - residents will get not only more energy-efficient homes but also a new smart rubbish collection system. Each household will have different coloured bags to collect different types of rubbish. All bags will be thrown into communal chutes on the estate, from where it will enter an underground vacuum system that will take the rubbish to an optical sorting centre. Sensors in the chutes will identify different coloured bags, and it will be possible, if residents agree to it, to measure exactly what people are throwing away, with awards for those who are greenest. Director of marketing at Envac Jonas Tornblom talked about the wider benefits to the city of having an underground bin system. ""It reduces the movement of waste lorries in residential areas and city centres, resulting in fewer accidents and less noise and pollution,"" he said. ""It also makes for better working conditions for waste collection workers, saves space for developers and means less littering."" Stockholm cannot become greener without help from eco-businesses, such as car-sharing schemes, but, here, the journey has not always been smooth. In November, car-sharing service Car2Go announced it was withdrawing its services from the city. A notice on its website said: ""Despite our efforts and the loyal business partners, we did not reach the necessary number of members or car usage."" So perhaps there is still a long road to persuading citizens an eco-city is something that makes sense for them as well as for those who run it.","Smart is a word that has long prefaced a whole range of technology, from watches to fridges to homes."
"For those with Intel-compatible machines, the OS will be available in two versions - Windows 8 and Windows 8 Pro. And for those with devices, largely tablets, powered by ARM-designed chips there will be a Windows RT version. Microsoft wants to simplify how it markets Windows 8, which is expected to launch in autumn 2012. The complex flavours of past Windows - from basic to home, premium to ultimate - have become something of a joke among tech experts. Microsoft has called Windows 8 the most significant redesign of the Windows interface since its groundbreaking Windows 95 OS. The ARM version of the OS is the newest edition and reflects Microsoft's desire to unify the engine known for running desktop computers with that for tablets and smartphones. Windows RT will sit alongside Apple's iOS and Google's Android operating systems. It announced the new flavours on its Windows blog. Many of those reacting to the announcement were unimpressed by the name for its ARM version. ""You guys are doing a phenomenal job with Windows Phone, Windows 8, etc, which makes the naming of 'Windows RT' all the more maddening. You're trying to simplify the rest of the 'Windows Live' properties, which I applaud, but then you go with Windows RT? Does. not. compute,"" said Michael Jenke, summing up the views of many responses to the blog. No 'start' In an earlier 8,600-plus word blog post Windows president Steven Sinofsky detailed the ""energising and daunting"" challenges in developing Windows on ARM. A preview version of Windows 8 launched late last year and more than 100,000 changes had been made since the developer version went public. For the first time since its inception, the trademark Windows ""Start"" button will no longer appear - instead being replaced by a sliding panel-based menu. In a footnote in its blog, Microsoft said that there would be an adapted version of Windows 8 Pro for businesses.","Microsoft's next operating system will come in just three different flavours, the company has announced."
"It is the largest fine ever issued by the French data privacy watchdog CNIL. US retail giant Amazon was also fined 35 million euros for breaking the rules. CNIL said Google and Amazon's French websites had not sought visitors' consent before advertising cookies were saved on their computers. Google and Amazon also failed to provide clear information about how the online trackers would be used, and how visitors to the French websites could refuse the cookies, the regulator said. It has given the tech giants three months to change the information banners displayed on their websites. If they do not comply, they will be fined a further 100,000 euros per day until the changes are made. In a statement published by Reuters, Google said: ""We stand by our record of providing upfront information and clear controls, strong internal data governance, secure infrastructure, and above all, helpful products. ""Today's decision under French ePrivacy laws overlooks these efforts and doesn't account for the fact that French rules and regulatory guidance are uncertain and constantly evolving."" Amazon said it disagreed with the CNIL decision, ""We continuously update our privacy practices to ensure that we meet the evolving needs and expectations of customers and regulators and fully comply with all applicable laws in every country in which we operate,"" it said in a statement. Privacy In a separate case, Google is being probed by a UK regulator over its plans to change the way the Chrome browser handles cookies. Google wants to stop advertisers using cookies to track users as they move around the web from one site to another when using Chrome, in a bid to improve privacy. It plans to introduce an alternative system know as the Privacy Sandbox that will only provide anonymised feedback.

"The bank had no firewall and used second-hand routers that cost $10 to connect to global financial networks. Better security and hardware would have hampered the attackers, Reuters said, quoting an official investigator. The hackers aimed to steal $1bn but made mistakes that led to the theft being spotted and stopped. Better defence A firewall would have made attempts to hack the bank more ""difficult"", Mohammad Shah Alam, a forensic investigator who works on the Bangladesh team investigating the theft, told Reuters. The second-hand hardware also meant that basic security steps to segregate network traffic were not taken, he said. The cheap routers have hindered the investigation, said Mr Alam, because they collected very little network data that could be used to pinpoint the hackers and shed light on their tactics. The hack took place in early February and involved hackers getting access to the core network of Bangladesh's central bank. They used this privileged access to transfer cash from Bangladesh's account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to other banks. A spelling mistake in one of the transfer orders alerted bank staff and meant the hackers only managed to steal $81m. This has been traced to accounts in the Philippines and to casinos in the same country. Most of the cash has yet to be recovered. Bank security experts said the bank should have spent more time and money protecting the network for its central bank. ""You are talking about an organisation that has access to billions of dollars and they are not taking even the most basic security precautions,"" Jeff Wichman, a consultant with cyber firm Optiv, told Reuters.","Hackers managed to steal $80m (£56m) from Bangladesh's central bank because it skimped on network hardware and security software, reports Reuters."
"By Chris FoxTechnology reporter CNIL said it had levied the record fine for ""lack of transparency, inadequate information and lack of valid consent regarding ads personalisation"". The regulator said it judged that people were ""not sufficiently informed"" about how Google collected data to personalise advertising. In a statement, Google said it was ""studying the decision"" to determine its next steps. Complaints against Google were filed in May 2018 by two privacy rights groups: noyb and La Quadrature du Net (LQDN). The first complaint under the EU's new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was filed on 25 May 2018, the day the legislation took effect. The groups claimed Google did not have a valid legal basis to process user data for ad personalisation, as mandated by the GDPR. Although Google's European headquarters is in Ireland, it was decided among the authorities that the case would be handled by the French data regulator, since the Irish watchdog did not have ""decision-making power"" over its Android operating system and its services. A lack of transparency The regulator said Google had not obtained clear consent to process data because ""essential information"" was ""disseminated across several documents"". ""The relevant information is accessible after several steps only, implying sometimes up to five or six actions,"" the regulator said. ""Users are not able to fully understand the extent of the processing operations carried out by Google."" No valid consent Additionally, the regulator said Google had failed to obtain a valid legal basis to process user data. ""The information on processing operations for the ads personalisation is diluted in several documents and does not enable the user to be aware of their extent,"" it said. It said the option to personalise ads was ""pre-ticked"" when creating an account, which did not respect the GDPR rules. ""The user gives his or her consent in full, for all the processing operations purposes carried out by Google based on this consent (ads personalisation, speech recognition, etc). ""However, the GDPR provides that the consent is 'specific' only if it is given distinctly for each purpose."" The regulator said it was Google's ""utmost responsibility to comply with the obligations on the matter"". In a statement, Google said: ""People expect high standards of transparency and control from us. We're deeply committed to meeting those expectations and the consent requirements of the GDPR.""","Google has been fined 50 million euros (£44m) by the French data regulator CNIL, for a breach of the EU's data protection rules."
"It said bogus ads for shoes briefly appeared among the selection of banners displayed on DailyMail.com. Instead of online shops, it said, the ads linked to malware that could expose computers to ""ransomware"". Ransomware encrypts files on a victim's computer and asks for a payment to decrypt them again. The practice is known as ""malvertising"". Security company Malwarebytes said it had made the discovery last week and had published a report about its findings online. A spokesman for the Daily Mail later said that it had not been contacted by Malwarebytes about its findings in advance. However, the BBC has seen evidence that the security company did in fact try to contact the newspaper about the issue last Friday. By Monday morning, the security company said that the fake ads had been removed. Bogus bargains Malwarebytes said the banners, purporting to be for an online shoe retailer, were published via a bogus ad server. From there, they were said to have been distributed via an advertising network that presents ads to readers on the Daily Mail's website. If a user clicked on one of the ads, said the security firm, they would be redirected to a well known piece of malware called the Angler Exploit Kit, which attacks vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer and Flash. There are various ways to protect yourself from ransomware, according to Tony Berning, senior manager at software company Opswat. ""To protect against ransomware, users must back up their data regularly,"" he said. ""In addition to this, an important defence against ransomware is the use of anti-virus engines to scan for threats. ""With over 450,000 new threats emerging daily, anti-malware engines need to detect new threats continuously, and will inevitably address different threats at different times,"" Mr Berning said.","Readers of the Daily Mail's website were shown fake advertisements that linked to malware, according to a security company."
"Fan fiction is literature inspired by popular books, films and TV shows, written by enthusiasts. Publication outside of blogs and online fanzines is often difficult because of copyright issues. A deal with a TV division of Warner Brothers enables fan fiction based on three TV series to be self-published. The three series are Gossip Girls, The Vampire Diaries and Pretty Little Liars, under the arrangement between Amazon and Alloy Entertainment, owned by Warner Brothers Television Group. Authors will be able to upload their writing for sale via a new platform called Kindle Worlds, which will initially only be available in America. There is no launch date yet for the platform. Authors will receive 35% of the overall price of their work in royalty payments if they have written 10,000 words or more, and 20% for works of 5,000-10,000 words under a new pilot scheme for shorter stories. In return Amazon Publishing will own the global publication rights to the works, says the announcement. Fan fiction containing sexually explicit scenes will not be accepted, the firm said. Writing on the Forbes website, technology journalist Jeff Bercovici described Kindle Worlds as ""a sort of open API [Application Programming Interface] for IP [intellectual property]"". Harry Potter, Star Trek and Buffy the Vampire Slayer are among the most common inspirations for fan fiction, he added. ""While some authors disapprove of the practice, many of the top-selling genre writers, including JK Rowling, Stephenie Meyer and Joss Whedon, encourage use of their characters by fans,"" wrote Mr Bercovici. The Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy, which has sold more than 70 million copies worldwide, was originally written by author EL James as fan fiction based on the novels and film franchise Twilight, by Stephenie Meyer.",Amazon has announced that fan fiction authors will be able to sell some of their work on the firm's Kindle e-book platform.
"By Dave LeeTechnology reporter, BBC News Just as well, some pundits agreed - as if there was a chance he would have done, he may not have been allowed to run it in the first place. As the 400m semi-final at the London 2012 Olympic Games drew to a close, he may have been well off the pace, but he was well ahead of his time. As the first double leg amputee to compete against able-bodied opponents at the Olympics, Pistorius has fired the starting pistol on arguably the most significant debate elite sport will ever encounter. Soon, athletes using technology to enhance their bodies will be able to jump higher, leap farther and last longer - stretching our concept of what it means to push the human body to the limit. It's a limit no longer being pushed out on the track but in a scientific lab. 'Look out the window' It is in one such lab, within the Ottobock factory in Germany, that Heinrich Popow had his running blade developed. The Kazakhstan-born athlete - who moved to Germany as a seven-year-old - lost his left leg to cancer when he was nine. In its place, a carbon-fibre masterpiece that will enable him to compete in the 100m and 200m, as well as the long jump. ""Before my amputation I was playing football, just like every little kid,"" Popow told the BBC. ""It was not hard for me having an amputation, [but] it was hard for me to look out of the window and see the little kids playing football outside."" Nate Williams is one of several engineers at the Ottobock Factory who has helped Popow forge his athletics career. The factory has been making prosthetics for more than 85 years. Its founder, Otto Bock, pioneered mass-production prosthetics - a necessary step to handle a huge influx of war-hit amputees with little money to support them. ""We have a major research and development facility here,"" Mr Williams says. ""The products are designed, manufactured and tested - all at this location."" Popow's blade is built up layer-by-layer before being placed into an autoclave and subjected to a high-powered vacuum. ""It comes in layers that are 0.1mm thick up to almost 2mm,"" says Mr Williams. ""We've stacked those layers one on top of the other. We can orient the fibres in a certain specific direction so that we can maximise the stiffness and the strength."" Nano-technology Since those first prosthetics were made at the Ottobock factory in 1919, the purpose of Paralympic technology has centred on compensating for something - usually a limb - that is missing. Yet, in the coming years, we may look back to Oscar Pistorius' eighth place finish as the beginning of something far bigger. ""Rather than thinking about prosthetic devices as quite clunky apparatus that we stick on our bodies, a more likely scenario is where we have nano-technology devices under our skin and improving our physical properties without us really noticing it,"" says Andy Miah, professor of ethics and emerging technology at the University of the West of Scotland. Where some athletes today decide to utilise illegal performance-enhancing drugs, we could find ourselves with sportsmen and women with performance-enhanced bodies. ""In the future we will think of everybody as already disabled,"" Prof Miah says. ""And it won't be a question of whether people that have disabilities are better or worse. ""It's about trying to ensure that everyone with their particular limitations is able to use technology in a way that optimises their performance."" Unsurprisingly, sports authorities are keeping a close eye on whether technology is being unfairly used, which already has a nickname - techno-boosting. International Paralympics Committee's (IPC) medical and scientific director Peter van de Vliet told the BBC performance-enhancing technology was monitored as strictly as medication. ""Whatever equipment you bring to the field of play, the critical endeavour is the human performance, rather than the impact of the technology and equipment. ""We cannot deny we should not hamper the development of technology. It is something where these two communities need to find each other and then agree on what can be put into the rules at which moment in time."" 'Interaction celebration' Mr Van de Vliet argues technology goes too far at the point at which it pushes performance beyond human limits. But Prof Miah, like many in the scientific community, says ""human limit"" is an unenforceable boundary that is anti-sport. ""The spirit of sport is such that everyone believes we can go faster, we can jump higher, we can lift more weight - and technology is a part of that process. ""The moment that a foot hits the track is a technological interaction. The idea that sports are somehow a celebration of human natural talents is misleading. I think it's a celebration of the interaction of biology with technology."" Popow is preparing for an altogether different celebration - one of his own triumph over adversary. His technology is not about making him somebody he is not, but someone he has always strived to be. ""I often get asked if I would like to get my leg back. I would say, 'No, never ever'. I just got one bad thing in my life - and got 100 positive things now. I'm really happy with what I have."" The interviews in this article were first heard on Click from the BBC World Service.

"It thanked one reviewer who said it had triggered ""one major seizure"" and left them ""close"" to another several times. ""Regarding a more permanent solution, [the] dev team is currently exploring that and will be implementing it as soon as possible,"" it tweeted. The game is released on Thursday, after months of repeated delays. What is the problem? Video games have long been a potential trigger for those who have epileptic seizures and standard warnings have been written in to licence agreements over the years. Writing an extensive and widely shared safety advisory for GameInformer, Liana Ruppert said she often had seizures and was careful about what she chose to play but Cyberpunk 2077 had been particularly difficult. Part of the problem is the frequent use of flashing lights and flickering animations - a common trigger for seizures - in the game's neon-future aesthetic. ""Cyberpunk 2077 is about hedonistic excess,"" Ruppert wrote. ""Everything is brighter, louder, and more in your face. ""There are a lot [of triggers] that you need to be aware of."" Another part of the game reportedly allows players to view memories by having their character don an in-game headset. This ""features a rapid onslaught of white and red blinking LEDs [light-emitting diodes], much like the actual device neurologists use in real life to trigger a seizure when they need to trigger one for diagnosis purposes"", Ruppert wrote. ""This is a pattern of lights designed to trigger an epileptic episode and it very much did that in my own personal playthrough."" UK charity Epilepsy Action had also objected, saying the features ""are unsafe and should have been avoided to make the game more accessible"". Why does it matter? Cyberpunk 2077 is the most anticipated game of the year for many players, some of whom may have epilepsy. It also follows years of steady progress in game accessibility. The Last of Us Part 2, another of this year's most anticipated titles, was widely praised for the measures taken to make it enjoyable for gamers who had hearing or visual impairments. In contrast, gamers who have epilepsy may have difficulty enjoying Cyberpunk 2077 until the developer's ""more permanent solution"" arrives. Created by CD Projekt Red, the widely praised developer of the successful The Witcher series of games, it was announced in 2012 but has been in earnest development for about four years. Its release-date announcement, at E3 2019 game conference, revealed actor Keanu Reeves would star, before Reeves himself emerged dramatically on to the stage to promote the game. High expectations have made the game a key reason for many gamers to upgrade to the latest PC hardware. And initial reviews have been largely positive, with an average score of more than 90%. But some critics have said the story fails to live up to expectations. And even positive reviews have highlighted many bugs and glitches in the game.","The developer of Cyberpunk 2077 is adding warnings to the game, after reviewers and charities complained it caused epileptic seizures."
"By Dan SimmonsBBC Click presenter Researchers showed the TV programme how an attacker could make the tubs hotter or colder, or control the pumps and lights via a laptop or smartphone. Vulnerable tubs are designed to let their owners control them with an app. But third-party wi-fi databases mean hackers can home in on specific tubs by using their GPS location data. Balboa Water Group (BWG), which runs the affected system, has now pledged to introduce a more robust security system for owners and said the problem would be fixed by the end of February. Christmas alert Pen Test Partners - the UK security company that carried out the research - warned that hot tubs were not the only household items at risk. Founder Ken Munro said that many Christmas gifts people would receive this year would connect to the internet and offer remote control through apps. ""Manufacturers still are not taking security seriously enough, and until they do consumers have to be very vigilant,"" he said. ""We recommend users reset any default passwords the device has immediately with a unique one of their own."" ""Next to no security"" In the case of the hot tubs, the researchers found that information found on public resources, known as ""wardriving databases"", could be used to hijack the equipment without the need for any other kind of authentication. BWG told the BBC that it had been ""surprised"" to learn of the flaw as its app had been available for five years during which users had not reported any problems. It said it was working with more than 1,000 owners in the UK and others globally to set up a system of individual usernames and passwords to secure the online controls. It said it had previously opted not to do so because it had wanted to ""allow for simple and easy use and activation"" by homeowners. Mr Munro said this had been ""irresponsible"". ""It takes away consumer choice and it takes away users' right to privacy and security,"" he explained. The researcher acknowledged that it was not the most serious internet-of-things vulnerability in the world, but said it was still worth bringing to the public's attention. ""Blowers are only turned on when someone is in the tub, so a hacker could figure out if you're in the tub at the time, which is creepy,"" he explained. ""Consumer IoT security is not in a good place. These findings underline that.""","Thousands of hot tubs can be hacked and controlled remotely because of a hole in their online security, BBC Click has revealed."
"The Android-powered Xperia Z is 0.27in (6.9mm)-thick. That is 0.01in thinner than Apple's iPad Mini despite featuring a bigger 10.1in screen. It coincides with news that LG is releasing a 5in handset - the Optimus G Pro - making it the latest to offer the so-called ""phablet"" form factor. Both devices have only been confirmed for release in Japan, but more details are expected next month. Mobile World Congress is being held in Barcelona from 25 to 28 February and is a popular time to announce global launches of new smart devices. Samsung has already said it would show off a new 8in version of its Galaxy Note tablet family at the event. Water-resistant tablet Beyond being thin, Sony's new tablet can also lay claim to being the lightest for its size. The firm says it weighs 1.1lb (495g) - a fraction below the Toshiba Excite 10 LE which previously laid claim to the title. In addition it is water and dust-resistant - featuring similar plastic covers to protect its ports as are found on the firm's Xperia Z smartphone which was announced a fortnight ago at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas. The two Sony devices are designed to work together, allowing photos and other data to be transferred between the phone and tablet using the firm's ""one-touch sharing"" facility which is activated by waving the machines close to each other to activate their near field communications (NFC) chips. ""It's a good product and on the face of it it should do well, but it is hampered by a potential squeeze on the larger tablet segment as a lot of consumers and other manufacturers are moving to the smaller 7in-to-8in form factor - in part because of their cheaper price,"" David McQueen, principal analyst at the Informa Telecoms and Media consultancy, told the BBC. ""So the success of the Sony tablet might ultimately be determined by how much it costs as well as whether the firm bundles some of the content it owns from its music, movie and gaming divisions."" Packed pixels LG's new handset is effectively a version of its existing Optimus G phone with a bigger, more detailed screen. It offers 440 pixels per inch (ppi) - matching HTC's newly-released J Butterfly and Huawei's Ascend D2. This density of its pixels allows LG's handset to be marketed as offering playback of 1080p videos in their full high definition resolution. However, the trade-off is the screen is power-hungry. LG's handset features a 3,000 mAh (milliampere-hour) battery as a consequence which is bigger than that of most other smartphones. ""4G high-speed data connections are helping push the adoption of higher definition bigger screens on phones,"" said Mr McQueen, ""but I do think it will remain a small, though high-end, segment of the market."" Two screens Sony and LG's devices were revealed as part of Japanese network NTT Docomo's Spring line-up announcement. It also featured a more unusual handset from NEC Casio featuring two screens. The Medias W N-05E's displays are placed on either side of the device, but can also be folded out so that the two 4.3in LCD screens sit alongside each other. It is the second dual-screened smartphone to be announced in recent weeks - Russia's Yota unveiled a model in December which features one LCD screen and one e-ink display, which it said would go on sale in the second half of the year. However, recent history suggests such devices might only appeal to a niche audience. Samsung, LG and Kyocera are among others firms to have released dual-screened phones over the past two years which only achieved limited sales.",Sony has unveiled what it says is the thinnest tablet computer of its kind.
"Its iPlayer service streamed a full rugby match on Sunday, which was made available to the public but not promoted in advance. BT began screening live sport in 4K in 2015, and Sky followed a year later. But many experts believe HDR offers the more significant improvement of the two video technologies for owners of all but the largest TVs. ""The trial met its objectives,"" said Phil Layton, BBC Research & Development's head of broadcast and connected systems. ""We have proved our workflows, but like all trials there are issues we need to investigate and correct for the future."" HDR takes advantage of the fact modern screens can go brighter and/or darker than they used to be able to, providing a greater dynamic range. As a result, the shadows of an image can be made less murky while the highlights - including glints of light reflected off metal or water - can be given more impact. This makes it possible to deliver a television image that gets closer to the dynamic range the human eye can handle, thus making the picture seem more realistic. HDR is also accompanied by the adoption of a ""wider colour space"", meaning millions more colours can be displayed on compatible screens than had been the case before. ""We were very pleased when the Sun was able to push through the clouds, allowing the HDR to really show its full potential and capabilities in both dynamic range and the Rec 2020 colour space,"" said Quinn Cowper, from Timeline Television, which was also involved in the BBC trial. By contrast, 4K - also known as ultra-high definition (UHD) - refers to the fact that an image contains four times as many pixels as a 1080p high definition picture. This allows more detail to be displayed, but unless the TV is large or its audience is sitting close by, it can be hard to tell the difference. ""HDR is all about seeing the distance between the darkest blacks and whitest whites,"" said Joe Cox, from What Hi-Fi? magazine. ""It should make for a much more colourful and vibrant picture, which to anyone with a suitable TV is going to be that much more impressive than 4K alone."" World Cup next? Last weekend's stream, of a rugby match involving the York City Knights and Catalans Dragons, followed a more limited test earlier in the year. In February, the BBC delivered a private livestream of 4K HDR footage from a FA Cup football club's ground to TV manufacturers. A spokesman said that the broadcaster had taken deliberate decision not to publicise the follow-up test - despite making it available to users of the iPlayer Beta app on compatible TVs - because the trial had been organised for the benefit of its engineers rather than the public at large. He declined to reveal when the next experiment was planned, or if a fully fledged service might be ready in time for the Fifa World Cup football competition, which begins on 14 June. HDR rivals Streaming services, including Netflix, Amazon and YouTube, already offer pre-recorded HDR TV programmes and films to UK viewers. But the BBC has teamed up with Japan's NHK to create a new flavour of the technology, which they call hybrid-log gamma (HLG). The two broadcasters say HLG is better suited to live broadcasts than other types of HDR because it does not need to provide metadata - data about other data - to work. ""The equipment just doesn't support it - and we know from where metadata is used elsewhere, it gets lost, it gets corrupted,"" the BBC Research & Development has previously said. HLG, however, has some theoretical downsides of its own. It is not capable of describing as wide a dynamic range as Dolby Vision, nor can it provide information to calibrate the image to particular TV models. However, the BBC Research & Development says its tests indicate people cannot notice the difference. The BBC is not, however, the first to livestream sport in HDR. In March, BT claimed a ""world first"" when it streamed a Uefa Champions League game involving Juventus and Tottenham Hotspur in the HDR 10 format. That trial, however, was limited to a 1080p resolution image rather than 4K.",The BBC has broadcast a live event in 4K resolution and high dynamic range (HDR) colour for the first time.
"By Joe TidyCyber-security reporter Visits to fan-run Club Penguin Online surged during the coronavirus pandemic with more than a million new players. But racist, homophobic, anti-Semitic and sexual messages flow freely on the unauthorised platform. Disney said it was ""appalled"" by the website, and has ordered it to close or face legal action. Club Penguin Online appeared to go offline on Friday afternoon. One man involved in the site has been arrested on suspicion of possessing indecent images of children. Detectives say the man from London has been released on bail pending further inquiries. Fan-operated clones Disney's Club Penguin was one of the first social networks for children. Launched in 2005, it had more than 200 million players at its peak. While anybody could join the original website, content filters and human moderators were employed to stop inappropriate messages or personal information from being shared. But Disney closed the website in 2017. Since then, unofficial clones of the website have been operated by fans. These private servers were launched using stolen or copied source code, and can easily be found by children searching the internet. Club Penguin Online is the largest of the social network's unofficial and unauthorised clones. It says its popularity has exploded during the coronavirus pandemic and now has seven million registered players. Penguin e-sex The BBC set up an account on the English, Spanish and Portuguese versions of Club Penguin Online. It found: Disney's original game banned the sharing of personal details, but players on this cloned site are openly sharing Snapchat, Instagram and Discord account details. A Zoom ""meet-up"" was also advertised and codes and passwords shared openly. Although it is impossible to verify the age of users, many told the BBC they were teenagers, and there were children playing, too. Kaden, 14, told the BBC there were areas of the game where it was safe to operate - but most players were in the unprotected ""mature"" sections. He said the conversations he had seen made him extremely uncomfortable. ""Any kid can click on these mature sections and they just see all this inappropriate stuff,"" he said. ""I've seen people advertise strip club igloos, I've seen people ask for pimps. There's a lot of swearing on there and I've been asked a lot of crazy things. It's really put me off going on these mature servers."" Kaden's dad, Rick, told the BBC he had no idea what was happening in the game. ""I'm shocked. I thought that if he's on Club Penguin, then he's in a pretty safe place."" Another long-time Club Penguin fan, teenager Miranda, said the game had ""gone from being family-friendly and fun to being monstrous"". Cold war Club Penguin Online is the largest private server and uses Disney's branding. One former staff member told the BBC the project had made about £9,000 through adverts, while most of the staff were young unpaid volunteers. Competition between Club Penguin Online and other unofficial versions of the game had escalated in the past six months. Server owners accused one another of hacking and harassment. One said it was a toxic community, ""like Game of Thrones with penguins"". The Club Penguin Online volunteer claims he was encouraged to carry out attacks on rival servers when he was a minor. ""I would find out and publish [users'] personal details, like addresses, what they looked like, their family's information. I carried out DDoS (distributed denial of service attacks) on other users, and I would threaten people. The stuff that I did was similar to what happened to me, which affected my whole family, but I do feel really bad about it now."" A current Club Penguin Online staff member denied that this sort of activity was encouraged. Some gamers think the toxic culture on some of these fan servers is a wider problem that needs addressing. Gaming YouTuber Simi Adeshina, known online as Tamago2474, said: ""These private server games are being run by people who aren't really in a position or qualified to do so. It's all good and well to have a community that you've built, but when you get to a certain size there's a point where you have to have to employ a degree of professionalism."" Cease and desist Disney has issued copyright notices to all private server games, giving them a deadline to close down or face legal action. In statement, it said said: ""Child safety is a top priority for the Walt Disney Company and we are appalled by the allegations of criminal activity and abhorrent behaviour on this unauthorised website that is illegally using the Club Penguin brand and characters for its own purposes. ""We continue to enforce our rights against this, and other, unauthorised uses of the Club Penguin game.""","Disney has ordered unauthorised copies of its Club Penguin game to close, after the BBC found children were being exposed to explicit messages."
"Dave LeeNorth America technology reporter The move comes in response to so-called ""challenges"" that have sometimes resulted in death or injury. The Google-owned video sharing site said such material had “no place on YouTube”. However, the firm appears to be failing to enforce its existing rules on harmful content. A Buzzfeed report detailed how images depicting, or alluding to, bestiality were still appearing on the site - despite a pledge last April to remove the material. Some of the videos had attracted many millions of views. YouTube said it “worked to aggressively enforce our monetisation policies to eliminate the incentive for this abuse”. Crossing the line But enforcing its new rules on pranks may prove even more difficult, given ambiguity over what may or may not be considered harmful. “YouTube is home to many beloved viral challenges and pranks,” a message added to the site’s FAQ section read. “That said, we’ve always had policies to make sure what’s funny doesn’t cross the line into also being harmful or dangerous. “Our Community Guidelines prohibit content that encourages dangerous activities that are likely to result in serious harm, and today clarifying what this means for dangerous challenges and pranks.” From now on, the site said it would not allow videos that featured “pranks with a perceived danger of serious physical injury"". This includes pranks where someone is tricked into thinking they are in severe danger, even if no real threat existed. Child trauma The site added: “We also don’t allow pranks that cause children to experience severe emotional distress, meaning something so bad that it could leave the child traumatized for life.” YouTube said it had worked closely with child psychologists on what might constitute a traumatic experience. It did not post a full list, but said it included scenarios where a child is tricked into believing their parents had died. The new rules come in response to several instances of pranks and stunts that are seriously ill-advised at best, and deadly at worst. In May, Minnesota woman Monalisa Perez, 20, was sentenced to six months in prison after shooting dead her boyfriend, Mario Ruiz. The couple had hoped video of their stunt, in which an encyclopaedia was meant to protect Mr Ruiz, would go viral on YouTube. Also last year, the American Association of Poison Control Centers reported a spike in reported cases of illness from detergent ingestion following a craze that had people eating pods containing laundry detergent. It prompted the product’s maker, Procter and Gamble, to enlist the help of American Football star Rob Gronkowski to front a public awareness campaign on social media. More recently, a challenge inspired by a scene in Netflix show Birdbox involved carrying out activities - such as driving - while blindfolded. At least one person is known to have crashed as a result. ________ Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC Do you have more information about this or any other technology story?

"Using computers to trawl through vast amounts of medical data speeds up the diagnosis process. The system will help assess individual tumours and suggest which drug should be used to target them. Doctors have welcomed the new computer which will learn from each case it examines. ""When you are dealing with cancer, it is always a race,"" said Dr Lukas Wartman, assistant director of cancer genomics at the McDonnell Genome Institute at Washington University in St. Louis, one of those signed up to use the Watson system. ""As a cancer patient myself, I know how important genomic information can be. ""Unfortunately, translating cancer-sequencing results into potential treatment options often takes weeks with a team of experts to study just one patient's tumour and provide results to guide treatment decisions. Watson appears to help dramatically reduce that timeline,"" he explained. Pressing issue Most people currently diagnosed with cancer will receive surgery, chemotherapy or radiation treatment. But as genetic sequencing becomes increasingly accessible and affordable, some patients are starting to benefit from treatments that target their specific cancer-causing genetic mutations. However the process is very time-consuming - a single patient's genome represents more than 100 gigabytes of data - and this needs to be combined with other medical records, journal studies and information about clinical trials. What would take a clinician weeks to analyse can be completed by Watson in only a few minutes. ""The technology that we're applying to this challenge brings the power of cognitive computing to bear on one of the most urgent and pressing issues of our time - the fight against cancer - in a way that has never before been possible,"" explained Steve Harvey, vice president of IBM Watson Health. According to Mr Harvey, Watson ""will look for actionable targets"", although he acknowledged that, ""when institutions do genetic sequencing, only about half the cases come back with something actionable"". Sometimes it is impossible to identify the main mutation and, in other cases, no targeted therapy currently exists. Those collaborating with IBM include the Cleveland Clinic, the Fred & Pamela Buffett Cancer Centre in Omaha and the Yale Cancer Centre. Eleven others will join the programme by the end of 2015 and each will pay an undisclosed subscription fee to IBM. Corporate medicine The link-up is part of an increasingly close relationship between the medical community and technology corporations. Apple revealed this week that it plans to develop apps for the iPhone that will allow users to take DNA tests which may reveal which diseases and health conditions they are likely to develop It also recently teamed up with IBM to allow the software that helps gather health data from iPhones to be used by Watson. IBM is convinced that Watson can ""help change the face of healthcare"" but it has even bigger ambitions for its cognitive computing platform. Speaking at an IBM event this week, the firm's chief executive Ginni Rometty made a bold prediction for the technology, saying: ""in the future, every decision mankind makes, every decision, is going to be informed by a cognitive system like Watson and, as a result, our lives in this world are going to be better for it.""","IBM's supercomputer Watson will be used to make decisions about cancer care in 14 hospitals in the US and Canada, it has been announced."
"By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor The Chinese technology company revealed the prototype in a post to the social media site Weibo. It promised the ""double-folding"" device was coming and asked the public to help name it. Samsung and the start-up Royole have previously unveiled flexible-screened phones of their own. But they only folded at a single point. ""It is very interesting that Xiaomi has adopted a three-way folding option on its prototype,"" said Ben Wood, from the consultancy CCS Insight. ""It is hard to judge the relative benefits of this versus a single fold and it will depend considerably on the user interface that Xiaomi chooses to adopt as it opens the ability to have a three-quarter screen option. ""However, it certainly means there is an additional point of failing. The fold is typically the area where there are most likely to be problems over time."" Rumours of the device's existence began to circulate at the start of the month after the journalist Evan Blass posted a separate video of the handset to Twitter. However, he was unable to verify it was real. The company has, however, confirmed to the BBC the latest clip, featuring its co-founder Bin Lin, is authentic, but said it had nothing to add at this point. Weibo shows that the video has already been played nearly 3.5 million times and attracted thousands of comments since it was uploaded on Wednesday. Foldable screens present smartphone-makers a means to make their products look more distinctive after a period during which they have coalesced around the same form: a dark black rectangle with ever-shrinking bezels. But the innovation is expected to come at a steep price, at least when the first devices go on sale. And it is unclear as yet what use cases manufacturers will promote to justify the added cost. Royole is still seeking feedback from software creators via a ""developers' version"" of its handset. That went on sale late last year. Huawei has said it will launch a phone with a fold-out screen in 2019, while Samsung has said it will reveal more details about its plans for the Galaxy X phone - first teased in November - at a press event on 20 February. Lenovo-owned Motorola has also published a patent that illustrates how a flexible display could be incorporated into its classic flip-open Razr design. And Google has said it is working on a new version of Android that will natively support ""foldable"" devices rather than requiring manufacturers to create their own workarounds to adapt to the changing dimensions of their devices' screens. Other manufacturers may also have further announcements of their own to make at the Mobile World Congress trade show in Barcelona, which begins on 25 February. ""Folding displays are still very much a case of a solution looking for a problem but I remain firmly convinced that we are seeing the seeds being sown for the next generation of smart devices,"" said Mr Wood. ""[One concern is] the additional bulk the fold creates. ""However, there is no doubt a smartphone with a folding screen will be a magnet for gadget lovers."" IBM Simon: The first mobile phone to offer a touchscreen user-interface - but its battery only lasted an hour. Siemens S10: The first handset with a colour display - although only red, green, blue and white could be shown. LG Prada: The handset debuted a capacitive touchscreen - detecting finger taps by changes in the display's electrical field rather than pressure. iPhone: Apple made use of ""multi-touch"", detecting several points of contact - allowing pinch-to-zoom and other interactions. Nokia N85: First phone with an OLED (organic light-emitting diode) display, letting it show deeper blacks and better contrast. Samsung Galaxy Note: Although not the first ""phablet"", the handset proved there was demand for a 5+ inch display, despite claims it was ""comically huge"". LG G Flex: The curved design was derided as being a gimmick, but points the way to the true ""bendy"" phones of the future. Sharp Aquos Crystal: The phone's ""edgeless"" look foreshadowed today's trend to keep bezels to a minimum. Samsung Galaxy Note Edge: Samsung's first handset to wrap its screen over one its sides used the extra space for notifications and app shortcuts. Sony Xperia Z5 Premium: The smartphone premiered a 4K display before it was easy to obtain such ultra-high definition mobile content. Essential Phone: The start-up beat Apple to featuring a camera notch in its display, which allowed the rest of the screen to extend upwards. Royole FlexPai: The California-based start-up surprised the industry when it revealed the ""world's first foldable phone"" last year.",A smartphone that transforms into a tablet by folding out two parts of its display bent behind its back has been unveiled by Xiaomi.
"It confirmed more than 105,000 web addresses were connected to illegal images in 2018, with 47% of the content hosted in the Netherlands. It warned that the country was becoming a ""safe haven for child sexual abuse"". The Dutch government has acknowledged an increase in reports of child abuse images and has pledged to tackle it. Such material should be ""expunged from the internet,"" it said in a report early in 2018. What was in the report? The IWF is an independent organisation that lets people report illegal child sex abuse images that they spot online. The organisation works with websites, social networks and law enforcement to have the images taken down and investigated. Since 1996, it has assessed more than a million reports. In its annual report, the IWF said 105,047 web addresses were hosting child sexual abuse images in 2018. That is a large increase compared with 2017. The IWF said that improvements in its technology had helped it detect more illegal images. Susan Hargreaves, chief executive of the IWF, said the UK had created a ""hostile environment"" for people wanting to share illegal images. Just 0.04% of the images reported in 2018 were hosted in the UK, the report said. But Ms Hargreaves said the Netherlands needed to ""stand up and do what's right"". A majority of the reported photographs - 82% - were found on image-hosting services, rather than on social networks or private websites. Some of these services are based in the Netherlands due to the low cost of web-hosting there. The IWF declined to name any of the image-sharing sites that had been found hosting child abuse images. It told the BBC it works with companies to make sure that content is removed. It said it had also offered its support to the Dutch organisation responsible for dealing with illegal images in the country. One of the reasons the number of images hosted in the United States was lower is because US tech giants such as Facebook are quick to remove them before reports reach the IWF. Home Secretary Sajid Javid welcomed the IWF's report. He said tackling child sexual abuse imagery was one of his ""personal missions"".","Almost half of the child sexual abuse images reported to the Internet Watch Foundation last year were hosted in the Netherlands, the organisation says."
"The paper says the documents indicate the FBI has installed equipment on the property of certain US-based tech firms and passes on retrieved data to the CIA and National Security Agency (NSA). It says in some cases the NSA may be provided with live notifications about a target's activity in ""real time"". Critics have raised privacy concerns. ""Prism is the most egregious example of NSA overreach that we've seen in the last 10 years or so,"" Eric King, head of research at London-based campaign group Privacy International, told the BBC. ""The fact that this material is being shared with the Brits at GCHQ raises serious concerns about the legal regime that is in place for processing the information"". The leaked presentation has named the sources of the data as Microsoft and its Skype division; Google and its YouTube division; Yahoo; Facebook, AOL, Apple and PalTalk. According to the Washington Post, the NSA may gain access to users' ""emails, attachments, address books, calendars, files stored in the cloud, text or audio or video chats and 'metadata' that identify the locations, devices used and other information about a target"". The NSA has said that its communications surveillance programmes have helped prevent more than 50 ""potential terrorist events"" since the attacks on 11 September 2001. US President Barack Obama has added that Prism is ""narrowly"" focused on terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and related issues. ""We are not rifling through the emails of ordinary emails of German citizens or American citizens or French citizens or anybody else,"" he said last month. Live surveillance The latest leaked documents comprise three jargon-heavy flowcharts explaining how data is gathered and logged for Prism, and a fourth slide showing what appears to be a screenshot of the tool used by the NSA to search through the database. The screenshot states that there were 117,675 records stored within Prism's system as of 5 April. The newspaper says this equates to ""active surveillance targets"" and does not include others whose communications would have been ""incidentally"" collected as a result of them having been in contact with one of the targets. The NSA must have a ""reasonable"" belief that either the sender or receiver of a communication is a foreign national located outside the US at the time of collection, according to a law passed in 2008 that made Prism possible. The Washington Post's analysis of the latest slides indicates the FBI does indeed check the search terms - or ""selectors"" - used by NSA agents to identify their specified targets to ensure the bureau agrees they are unlikely to be a US citizen, permanent US resident or otherwise located in the country. The paper says the slides show that once a target is approved, FBI agents do not review the information passed on, however it appears that automated filters - referred to as ""Fallout and Conveyance"" - are used to reduce the amount of information about Americans. In addition to stored data, the paper says the FBI can also pass on details of targets' live activities to allow ""real-time surveillance"" of their use of at least some of the tech firms' services. It says that depending which firm is involved, NSA agents may receive alerts when a target logs on or sends an email, and they can also monitor voice calls and text chats as they happen. The news may put the named tech firms under renewed pressure to disclose more information about the extent of their co-operation. They had previously denied providing ""direct access"" to the NSA, but only Google has explicitly denied providing a ""backdoor"" to any government agency. ""A number of the companies have said they do not provide 'direct access' - but the question is what does that term mean?"" said Mr King. ""From our perspective it doesn't particularly matter if there's a box inside the company network or not. The fact remains, regardless of technically how it is set up, the NSA request information under this exceptionally broad law and the companies are forced to provide it.""",Fresh details about Prism have emerged after the Washington Post published four more leaked slides detailing the US internet surveillance programme.
"Priya Sawhney evaded event security, as well as some of Mr Bezos' personal detail, which costs a reported $1.6m (£1.25m) per year. ""Jeff, you are the richest man on the planet,"" Ms Sawhney said, holding a flower. ""You can help the animals."" Mr Bezos and Jenny Freshwater, another Amazon executive on stage at the time, sat calmly as the woman was removed. ""Do you have a response to that?"" Mr Bezos quipped after Ms Sawhney had been taken away. Mr Bezos was appearing as part of the firm's Re:Mars conference, where the company has discussed its efforts in machine learning, automation, robotics and space. On that last topic, Mr Bezos said he wanted to provide foundational space technology for start-ups to build on for low cost, noting that Amazon was only possible because it was able to distribute through the US Postal Service. The Direct Action Everywhere animal rights group said it was protesting against what it claims is poor treatment of chickens at a farm in Petaluma Poultry, a California farm that supplies chicken and turkey to Amazon and others. ""Animal abuse is the crime here, not animal rescue,"" Ms Sawhney said in a press release published quickly after the incident.

"By Dave LeeTechnology reporter, BBC News The company said 14% of users left the game between January and March - a fall of 1.3 million. The majority of lost users were in the East, despite the company making efforts to appeal to those markets, with recent upgrades. Activision told investors to expect subscriber figures to dip further. Shares in the publisher fell by about 5% on Wednesday, following the news. The California-based company blamed the rise of free-to-play games. Uncertainty around new consoles due from Microsoft and Sony - and the ""very slow start"" of Nintendo's newest offering, the Wii U - had contributed to what will be a challenging 2013 for the company as a whole, chief executive Bobby Kotick said. Martial arts pandas He told investors on Wednesday: ""It's important to note that the nature of online games has changed, and with the environment becoming far more competitive. ""To address this, we're working to release new content more frequently to keep our players engaged longer and make it easier for lapsed players to come back into the game."" Despite the user dip, the company said World of Warcraft still had 8.3 million players - making it the most popular subscriber-based online game in the world. ""Warcraft's exposure to ongoing developments in online gaming keeps growing,"" said Steve Bailey, a senior analyst at IHS Screen Digest. ""It is coming under pressure on several fronts - subscription-based online gaming is losing ground to micro-transactions and hybrid-monetisation models."" World of Warcraft's subscriber numbers were as high as 12 million in 2010. In October 2012, 10 million gamers were signed up - a figure boosted by the release of Mists of Pandaria, an expansion pack that sold 2.7 million copies in its first week. That title, which featured a new ""continent"" on the game inhabited by martial-arts-skilled pandas, was targeted at the Asian market. The push reaped initial rewards - user numbers swelled to more than one million in China - but the figures made public on Wednesday suggested the spike was short-lived. ""This is no surprise,"" Mr Bailey added. ""China is a very advanced and fiercely competitive market for online gaming, that, as well as offering greater direct competition to World of Warcraft, is also experiencing its own shifts in terms of business models and devices."" Disney onslaught Beyond World of Warcraft, Activision anticipated further difficulties in 2013. Skylanders, the company's series that allows players to use real-life toy figures to interact with the game using near-field communications technology, has been very well received by critics and gamers alike. But it will face stern new competition from a major player - Disney. The media corporation plans a similar title with add-on accessories, Disney Infinity, to be released in the summer. Enhanced interactive features and the benefit of a wealth of highly recognisable and well-loved characters could give Disney an edge, some games enthusiasts predict. But Activision is determined to remain competitive and already has an eye on the Christmas market. ""The secret to Skylanders' success from the very beginning has been to continually surprise and delight our fans with meaningful innovation and superior gameplay,"" said Eric Hirshberg, chief executive of Activision's publishing division. ""This [autumn], we are pushing the genre forward once again with Skylanders Swap Force. Swap Force introduces an all new play pattern - dynamic swapability.""

"By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor Then on Sunday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Fox News that action would be taken in the coming days to address ""national security risks that are presented by software connected to the Chinese Communist Party"", including the short-form video app. So, how might a ban work? One obvious starting place would be to order Apple and Google to remove the app from their online stores. This might be done by adding TikTok's owner Bytedance to a Commerce Department entity list, and forbidding US firms from working with it - a similar tactic was used to stop Google providing its apps to Huawei. That would prevent new users from being able to download the app. Existing users would be prevented from receiving notifications and installing updates, although they would still have the app on their devices. One way to address this would be to tell Apple and Google to use a ""kill switch"" facility they both have, which lets them remotely wipe or prevent blacklisted apps from launching. A Brazilian judge once threatened to force the two firms to use the power in 2014, but ultimately backed off. Apple and Google would likely be loath to take control of users' smartphones in such a way and might even resist such an order. So an easier alternative might be to compel local internet service providers to block access to TikTok's servers. This would have the added advantage of preventing TikTok's videos being viewable via its website. India took such a measure when it banned TikTok and dozens of other Chinese apps. And users have reported being unable to circumvent the block by using a virtual private network (VPN). But it's not clear how Mr Trump would enforce such an order. A less draconian approach would be to ban TikTok from being installed onto federal employees' work phones. Congress has already voted in favour of the idea and the Senate is still considering it. But that would be a much less dramatic move than Trump seems to be hinting at. A further possibility is that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (Cfius) - which is chaired by the US Treasury - rules against Bytedance's takeover of the app Musical.ly, whose users were migrated over to TikTok in 2018. Musical.ly was owned by another Chinese start-up. But Cfius has the power to review takeovers that potentially pose a national security risk. And because Bytedance did not seek clearance for the acquisition at the time, the committee was able to launch a post-deal probe last year. If Cfius rejects the takeover, it could order Bytedance to shut down the service in the US. The question is whether a spun-off TikTok would be allowed to continue under different ownership as an alternative, perhaps even with a rebrand. Microsoft has confirmed it is in talks to acquire the business in the US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand - some internet wags have already suggested it might be called Microsoft Teens (a play on the the firm's Teams service). The US tech giant would presumably be viewed as a more trustworthy guardian of the data the app collects, and assuage fears the China might still be somehow accessing its logs. Microsoft has said it aims to complete talks with Bytedance by 15 September. What does TikTok say? ""One hundred million Americans come to TikTok for entertainment and connection. ""We've hired nearly 1,000 people to our US team this year alone, and are proud to be hiring another 10,000 employees. ""TikTok US user data is stored in the US, with strict controls on employee access. TikTok's biggest investors come from the US. ""We are committed to protecting our users' privacy and safety as we continue working to bring joy to families and meaningful careers to those who create on our platform.""

"By Tom GerkenBBC UGC & Social News Popular YouTubers Mystic7, Trainer Tips and Marksman, who have more than 3.5 million subscribers between them, were among those who had their accounts deleted after posting videos of themselves playing Pokemon GO. They were told their videos contravened YouTube's community guidelines because ""YouTube prohibits uploading... any type of activity that sexualises minors"". YouTuber Billiam Thies told the BBC that not only was his YouTube channel removed, but his entire Google account was deleted as well - a move that Google, who owns YouTube, now admits was a mistake. ""People on Twitter were letting me know my YouTube account was down,"" he said. ""But because my Google account was terminated as well I didn't have access to my email so I couldn't see what happened."" It is not clear how many people had their accounts removed in error, but it appears that all of the accounts have been reinstated after people took to social media to complain. According to YouTube, if a person believes that their video has been mistakenly removed, a different reviewer will reassess it - and in this case, the videos were re-reviewed and the accounts were reinstated. This has led to consternation, with popular Pokemon GO YouTuber Mystic criticising the company amidst what some labelled a ""total lack of communication"". 'Sexual content involving minors' The question which has been repeatedly asked on social media is how YouTube managed to confuse footage from a video game with something illegal. The problem seems to centre around the acronym ""CP"", which in the world of Pokemon GO refers to ""combat points"", or the measure of a Pokemon's strength in battle. Yet outside of Pokemon the acronym can be taken to stand for ""child pornography"", a term used to describe child abuse images.

"Citing China, Mr Zuckerberg also warned excessive control risked stifling individual expression. He was speaking at the Munich Security Conference in Germany. Social media giants like Facebook are under increasing pressure to stop the spread of false information. Facebook in particular has been criticised for its policy on political advertising. The company launched new policies for political advertising in the US in 2018 and globally the following year. These rules require political ads to display who had paid for them, and a copy of the ad is kept in a publicly-searchable database for seven years. But this week Facebook said it would not include sponsored political posts by social media stars in its database. Posts by politicians are not always fact-checked as part of the company's free speech policy either. At the conference he said he supported regulation. ""We don't want private companies making so many decisions about how to balance social equities without any more democratic process,"" he said. The Facebook founder urged governments to come up with a new regulatory system for social media, suggesting it should be a mix of existing rules for telecoms and media companies. ""In the absence of that kind of regulation we will continue doing our best,"" he said. ""But I actually think on a lot of these questions that are trying to balance different social equities it is not just about coming up with the right answer, it is about coming up with an answer that society thinks is legitimate."" Mr Zuckerberg also admitted Facebook had been slow to recognise the development of co-ordinated online ""information campaigns"" by state actors like Russia. He added that malevolent actors are also becoming better at covering their tracks by masking the IP addresses of users. To tackle this, Mr Zuckerberg said Facebook had a team of 35,000 people reviewing content and security on the platform. With assistance from AI, he said more than a million fake accounts are deleted every day. ""Our budget [for content review] is bigger today than the whole revenue of the company when we went public in 2012, when we had a billion users,"" he said. During his time in Europe, Zuckerberg is expected to meet politicians in Munich and Brussels to discuss data practices, regulation and tax reform. Despite public backlash over issues like political advertising, Facebook says the number of users on its family of apps - Facebook, Messenger, Whatsapp and Instagram - continues to grow. Earlier this month, Whatsapp announced that it is used by two billion people worldwide, more than a quarter of the world's population.","Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg has called for more regulation of harmful online content, saying it was not for companies like his to decide what counts as legitimate free speech."
"The problems appear to have started on Wednesday night, according to the Down Detector website. By late Thursday, the company said it had managed to restore service for most of its subscribers. Three apologised for the problem and said it was ""sorting this out right now"". On Thursday evening it added: ""Most of our customers are now back on our network. our engineers will continue to work into the night on any remaining issues."" Earlier it had advised customers still experiencing problems ""to turn their phones off and on or turn airplane mode on and off, which may resolve the issue"". Three has about 10 million customers in the UK. ID Mobile, a virtual network that uses Three's infrastructure, was also affected. The problems, which were nationwide, started after some maintenance work on Three's network infrastructure. On Wednesday, rival network O2 switched on its next-generation 5G service in a number of UK cities. Three tagged O2 in a tweet saying: ""Oi, did you unplug our network so you could plug in your 5G? not cool guys."" One customer said the joke would have been ""cute"" if the problems had not been ongoing for more than nine hours. So many customers tried to access the status checker on Three's website that it was temporarily unavailable on Thursday morning. A queuing system was switched on, to limit access to the tool. ""History shows that once service is restored people quickly forget about the issues,"" said Ben Wood, an analyst at the CCS Insight consultancy. ""The challenge for Three UK will be getting its network back online reliably. Often it can take time for things to stabilise after such a massive outage, which can lead to intermittent service for a period of time after the original problems.""","Mobile network Three has acknowledged ""technical difficulties with voice, text and data"" that left many customers unable to use their devices."
"Dave LeeNorth America technology reporter The company said third-party marketers may have been able to reach specific users on Twitter based on contact details, even if the user had not wished the information be used this way. In a statement, Twitter said it ""cannot say with certainty how many people were impacted"", but the BBC understands it affects users globally. Unusually, the company is not proactively contacting customers directly to inform them of the breach. The company would not say when it discovered the issue, but said it had addressed the problem “as of September 17” - 21 days ago. The firm said it was ""no longer using phone numbers or email addresses collected for safety or security purposes for advertising”. Twitter, which has its European headquarters in Dublin, would not confirm whether or not it had notified the Irish Data Protection Commissioner, other than to say it was communicating with regulators “where appropriate”. Under Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), users must be informed if data is used for a purpose other than what it was intended for. Twitter says it has 139 million users that use the platform every day and are served with adverts. Tailored advertising The issue involves a system Twitter offers advertisers whereby they can match their own database of customer email addresses - gathered independently from Twitter - with users on Twitter that use the same email address. The practice - common across social networks - allows for highly targeted advertising designed to reach users who are likely already familiar with the brand or product. However, what Twitter revealed in its statement on Tuesday was that this email matching was referencing addresses that users had submitted solely for the purpose of enhancing their account security by adding two-factor authentication. This is a method that adds a second level of security - such as getting a text message with a log-in code - to prevent malicious actors from being able to use a person’s credentials. ""When an advertiser uploaded their marketing list, we may have matched people on Twitter to their list based on the email or phone number the Twitter account holder provided for safety and security purposes,” the company explained. ""This was an error and we apologise.” In March, Facebook was highly criticised for using numbers and email addresses submitted for two-factor authentication to target advertising. Unlike Twitter, however, Facebook did not consider the behaviour to be mistake. But, in handing down its record-breaking $5bn fine, the US Federal Trade Commission said Facebook must stop using ""the phone numbers it obtained specifically for security” to power its advertising platform. _____ Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC Do you have more information about this or any other technology story?

"For a fee, Cuesongs and Ricall Express offer permissions to use well-known background tracks for videos posted to sites such as YouTube and Facebook. They could feature on wedding videos or online company adverts. Analysts say the companies fill a gap in the market, but warn it will still be difficult to convince people to pay. App developers Both the UK-based firms launched their new businesses at the Midem music industry festival in Cannes. Cuesongs is backed by the singer Peter Gabriel and offers recordings from Sony Music and several independent rights holders. It is operating an invitation-only trial for the time being. Ricall's new division builds on an existing service offered to the broadcast and gaming industries. It includes tracks from EMI Music as well as independent publishers. Examples of the customers they hope to attract include couples wishing to add music to their wedding video before uploading it to the internet, film festival entrants, small businesses making web adverts, school clubs and smartphone app developers. ""By introducing low prices and easy online access, Cuesongs is creating a new market for music, to satisfy a huge untapped demand that can begin to provide new income streams for artists,"" said Mr Gabriel. Ricall's commercial development vice-president, Phil Bird, said: ""There have been many automated sync platforms over the years. Commercial activities ""However, none have managed to find the holy grail of selling well-known commercial music for the 'long tail' of users."" The firms suggest that if their ""micro-usage"" services prove popular then more rights holders will be willing to license their material. The Music Publishers Association trade body welcomed their entry into the market. ""These services look to provide proper controls and safeguards for creators, whilst at the same time easing access and simplifying the process for those small businesses wanting to use music,"" said the MPA's spokesman, Will Lines. ""We are not talking here about individual web users paying to upload a clip of their child dancing to the radio as a YouTube clip. ""Rather, this is aimed at the thousands of small businesses using social media in their commercial activities."" 'Moral weight' Industry watchers say that many potential licensees have been perplexed by the complexity of rights management since different copyrights exist for the lyrics, score and recording of a song. That means that three or more parties might have to give permission before a track could be used. They say the one-stop shop nature of the new services solves that problem, and will give extra moral weight to music labels' demands that unlicensed material be removed from the web. However, many users may still decide to avoid payments. ""If the target clients post videos via YouTube, they may well already be covered to an extent by Google's blanket licences with the big record companies and collecting societies,"" said Chris Cooke, co-founder of the business music network CMU. ""That said, under Google's agreements rights owners can exercise a veto to have any video that 'syncs' their music removed at any point, even though they are being paid a royalty every time that video plays. A licence will remove that risk, and allow video makers to post their content beyond YouTube. ""Whether bedroom video makers will immediately see that as a benefit worth paying for I'm not sure, though more established independent directors may be more easily convinced.""","Two music licensing businesses have launched rival services targeted at individual users, small businesses and not-for-profit organisations."
"The notice added that those using the flying aircraft for tasks related to national security or critical infrastructure were most at risk. The warning does not refer to a specific company. But market-leader DJI said it had taken steps to keep its clients' data secure. ""We give customers full and complete control over how their data is collected, stored, and transmitted,"" the firm said in a statement. ""For government and critical infrastructure customers that require additional assurances, we provide drones that do not transfer data to DJI or via the internet, and our customers can enable all the precautions DHS [Department of Homeland Security] recommends."" DJI accounts for more than 70% of the US market in drones costing more than $500, according to research firm Skylogic. Yuneec - the second bestselling Chinese manufacturer - has also said that it gives users full control of their data. ""All our UAV [unmanned aerial vehicles] do not share telemetry or visual data with internal or external parties,"" said Chris Huhn, the firm's vice president of business development. ""Regardless of who you are - public authority, company or private individual - the drone data of your Yuneec drone always remains yours."" Privacy mode The notice was issued on Monday by the US's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, according to CNN, which was first to report the development. ""The United States government has strong concerns about any technology product that takes American data into the territory of an authoritarian state that permits its intelligence services to have unfettered access to that data or otherwise abuses that access,"" it quoted the memo as saying. ""China imposes unusually stringent obligations on its citizens to support national intelligence activities."" It is not the first time the US has raised such concerns. In August 2017, the US Army prohibited troops from using DJI's drones because of unspecified cyber-security concerns. The same month, the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agency said it suspected DJI was ""providing US critical infrastructure and law enforcement data to the Chinese government"". DJI reacted at the time by saying it only collected flight logs and captured images if users opted to share them, but it also introduced a privacy mode that it said prevented any data being uploaded to the internet. Yuneec has also taken steps to reassure government clients and other security-conscious customers. Last year, it teamed up with a US-based software and cloud storage provider to provide ""trusted solutions"". The timing of the latest warning came days after the Trump administration imposed restrictions on US firms using and providing technology to Huawei, another Shenzhen-based tech firm. Washington has cited concerns that Beijing could compel the telecoms equipment provider to help it spy on and otherwise attack countries that use its products - something the Chinese Communist Party and Huawei itself have denied. That has led to speculation that Chinese drone-makers could be next to face an official ban. But that could prove disruptive to a range of public agencies. Last week, a report from the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials highlighted that all 50 of the US's states were now using drones in some official capacity and that 36 employed certified drone pilots. Tasks involved range from road and bridge inspections, it said, to creating complex farming programmes.",The US government has issued an alert warning that Chinese-made drones could pose a cyber-espionage risk to American businesses and other organisations that use them.
"By Cristina CriddleTechnology reporter The collection of more than 4,100 testimonies include accounts from girls aged as young as nine. The youngsters have written personal accounts of “rape culture”, identifying the school or university the alleged perpetrators attended. Eton, St Paul’s and Latymer Upper School are among those referenced. But while these and other private schools commonly appear, there are also examples given of unnamed males from state schools and universities. The testimonies have been published on Everyone’s Invited website and its Instagram account. Experiences recounted range from being drugged and raped at parties to explicit images being shared over messaging platforms. 'It exists everywhere' “The testimonies expose rape culture and the scale of sexual violence amongst young people in the UK,” Soma Sara, founder of Everyone’s Invited, told the BBC. “If we start pointing fingers at certain demographics or singling out individuals or institutions, we risk making these cases seem like anomalies... when really this problem is pervasive, it exists everywhere.” Everyone had a responsibility to take action to expose and eradicate this culture, she added. “It is so important that teachers and parents are able to learn how to communicate with their children and talk about these issues,” she said. At least 35 people claim to have been raped in their testimony. In the accounts where a university or school is named, it is unclear when the incidents took place. The high master of St Paul’s said she had informed children’s services of the Instagram account. “The school completely condemns the actions described, and takes this matter extremely seriously,” Sally-Anne Huang said in a letter to alumni. “[We] would always investigate fully matters of this nature brought to our attention.” No names or details had been provided so the cases had not been reported to the police, she added. The issue of reporting is raised in some of the testimonies. “I blamed myself and think a lot of people - especially men, would blame me for getting into the situation in the first place,” one user wrote of not reporting her rape at the age of 17. “I didn’t feel that there was space to, or I was ashamed and I just felt so alone,” another account said. “I never said anything to someone of authority because I had no faith in an outcome,” one account which cites Goldsmiths, University of London, said. A spokesman for the university said it has a dedicated anonymous reporting and support website for victims of sexual violence, harassment or misconduct. Goldsmiths Students’ Union also runs anti-sexual violence training for students, and is currently running remote Consent Matters training to help educate students on consent and healthy relationships. 'Long way to go' “Every case of sexual violence is one too many, and universities are committed to becoming safer places to live, work and study,” said a spokesman for Universities UK, which represents UK universities. “Universities are taking innovative actions to address some of the issues, but there is a long way to go in ending sexual misconduct for good in higher education.” A spokeswoman for Eton College said it took any specific allegations “extremely seriously” and would report to the relevant authorities “when necessary.” Eton College is speaking to the founder of the website and looking for ways to work with them in future. Latymer Upper School, which is one of the most-mentioned schools, said it was “deeply disturbed” by the accounts on the website. “We have a zero-tolerance approach to behaviours that foster the prevalence of misogyny, sexism, harassment, abuse and assault,” a spokeswoman said, adding all reports of this kind were escalated to police when necessary. “We take all such issues very seriously and have encouraged anyone affected to come and talk to us directly. We will be listening carefully to them and reflecting on what further steps we should take.”",An online campaign inviting users to post anonymous testimonies of sexual assault and harassment has been growing in popularity.
"By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter According to a new report, The Future of the Force: Police, Technology and Serving the Public, a range of technologies could assist the police with their enquiries, from electronic notebooks to autonomous crowd monitoring, sensor networks and augmented reality. Much of the technology uptake is driven by the need to make savings as police budgets are cut but alongside that is a drive to ""turn data into real-time intelligence"", said Nigel Rees of Airwave, the company that runs the emergency services network and commissioned the report. ""This will use many different technologies, from electronic notebooks which allow officers to check a suspect's criminal record while they are at a crime scene, to sensor networks which help them to covertly track people and vehicles,"" he told the BBC. The vast majority of forces in the UK already use Twitter and Facebook to interact with the public, according to the report. Greater Manchester Police is among some of the keenest tweeters. It began to use social media to better engage with communities and now runs a community reporter scheme which invites members of the public to accompany officers on the beat and blog about it. The force currently has a presence on Twitter, Flickr, YouTube and Facebook and it holds regular Twitter days when every incident coming into the force is tweeted to make the public aware of the volume and type of work done by officers. The Metropolitan Police has one of the country's most popular police Twitter feeds and a recent study by think-tank Demos looked at how it performed in the wake of the Woolwich shooting in May. ""Our research revealed that everyone was using the Met's Twitter handle to send in vast amounts of information. There were accusations of criminal activities, requests for information, tweets about what the police were doing and some reporting of serious events that should have been sent through 999,"" said report author Jamie Bartlett. ""The issue then becomes what do the police actually follow up?"" he added. While most police forces stress that Twitter is not a replacement for the emergency services, there is anecdotal evidence that is some circumstances - for instance during a burglary when a home-owner doesn't want to alert the burglar to their presence - Twitter has been used instead of making a phone call. Crowd control While the police may still be getting to grips with how to use social networking effectively, some forces are experimenting with more cutting-edge technology. To ensure safety at the 2012 Olympic sailing events in Weymouth, Dorset police worked with tech firm CrowdVision to develop a way to understand how crowds behave. The system was originally developed as a public safety solution in Mecca for use during the annual Hajj pilgrimage. In Weymouth, CrowdVision hooked a digital camera on a local bar which overlooked the crowds gathered on the beach to watch events on giant screens. The camera was connected to a computer which ran software to offer real-time analysis of the crowd's movements. An algorithm detected human heads and analysed how those heads were moving from one video frame to another, in order to predict movement. ""It was installed in time for our busiest weekend and provided regular updates,"" explained Ch Supt David Griffiths. ""This gave us valuable data on what was happening in the walk-up to the live site area, where we had previously had some concerns about unpredictable crowding."" It meant, for example, that when the crowd surged towards the beach several minutes before Ben Ainslie took a gold medal for Great Britain, the police were able to react quickly and temporarily close the viewing point. Sensor network Several police forces are using small, lightweight drones as a cheap alternative to police helicopters. Merseyside Police was an early adopter and in 2010 a suspected car thief became the first person to be arrested in Britain with the help of a miniature, remote-controlled helicopter. The air robot was deployed after officers lost the alleged offender in thick fog. The report suggests that police drones could also be used as platforms for sensors, in future. The so-called internet of things - sensors on physical objects such as street furniture - is being talked up as a way of making our cities smarter, constantly feeding information back to a centralised database, offering information about traffic jams, water leaks and other incidents in order to improve the way cities function. Many police vehicles are already fitted with complex sensors which offer data from engine efficiency to driver behaviour. The police also routinely use sensors, known as automatic person location systems (APLS), on officers which help them locate someone if they have been hurt or to feed back information. The electronic tagging of criminals is commonplace but now some forces are starting to experiment with more controversial uses. In 2011, Hertfordshire Police tested a controversial new system which allowed them to track and map offenders using GPS. Now police in Sussex have deployed similar technology for use with dementia patients. The force estimates that one in four missing person enquiries relate to dementia patients. They claim the system is ""cost-effective"" but critics have branded it inhumane. Minority Report With increasingly digitised data and faster networks able to offer up that data in real-time, the report asks whether we will see Minority Report-style policing in future, with officers accessing information via devices such as Google Glass. The reality may be a little more mundane, said Dave Allen, a senior lecturer at Leeds University and one of the authors of the report. ""There is evidence that the more stress public safety workers are under, the less cognitive ability they can devote to technology. ""Therefore it is important to consider what information is supplied to police officers and account for how they can digest it and interact with it,"" he added. ""A simple flashing light in worn devices or using vibrations or sounds that are easier and quicker to process may be the answer."" Whatever technology is used it is important that it doesn't get in the way of old-fashioned policing. ""The question is to what extent augmentation could lead to ""deskilling"" as officers rely less on experience and developing skills in searching and seeking information and more on ""management by remote control or blinding following information drawn from systems,"" he said. Minority Report or not there is no getting away from the fact that technology is going to play an increasingly important role in policing, he thinks. ""We don't want to be stuck with the model of policing from the 19th Century,"" ""Technology shouldn't mean that police lose their community focus, in fact it should mean that they can serve them more effectively,"" he said.",The sci-fi vision of police officers rushing to the scene of a crime before any crime has even been committed may be rather far-fetched but technology is increasingly playing a role in the modern police force.
"By Dave LeeTechnology reporter, BBC News They include photos posted to publicly-accessible parts of social networks. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children received a record number of reports in the first week of July, four times the weekly average. It comes in a week UK authorities arrested 660 people in connection with online child abuse. That investigation was believed to have been targeted at those using the so-called ""dark net"" - parts of the internet that are hidden and can be hard to access without special software. But the NCMEC stressed there was still a significant and growing challenge for law enforcement agencies to deal with material on the open internet as well as the harder-to-reach areas. Tip-offs In the US, all electronic communications providers (ECPs) have had to report any instance of child abuse on their networks to the Cyber Tipline provided by the NCMEC since 1998. Since many of the world's most popular communications sites, such as Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest, are based in the US, the NCMEC works with authorities around the world to follow up leads provided by tips. The UK is among the 62 countries working closely with the NCMEC. In the week from beginning 29 June and ending July 5, 92,800 reports were made to the Cyber Tipline. Of those, the vast majority - 91,334 - came from internet firms, with the remainder being tip-offs from members of the public. On average, the NCMEC receives around 15,000 reports per week. John Shehan, executive director of the NCMEC Exploited Children Division, said the large numbers early in July may prove to be an anomaly. But he stressed the growing concern with social networks. ""You wouldn't think someone would do it on Pinterest or LinkedIn,"" Mr Shehan said. ""But any type of platform that allows people to post images or videos - they get used for the wrong reasons."" Extremely rare While most would assume social networks are an unlikely place for illegal material to be shared - by people who would presumably want to hide any trace of their identity - Mr Shehan said several theories had emerged. ""When you look at the types of offenders who have a sexual interest in children, there is a wide spectrum as far as their internet knowledge, and their backgrounds with being able to anonymise and hide their identities online. ""If you look at where the content is being uploaded from - sometimes we see that it goes back to third-world countries. ""Some of these are just starting to get high-speed internet access, and they may not be as sophisticated as some countries in using different anonymisers."" Paedophile arrests 660 suspected paedophiles arrested 431 children have been protected 39 suspects were registered sex offenders 833 buildings searched 9,172 devices, including phones and laptops, seized The BBC contacted the leading social networks that report into the NCMEC. All stressed that the latest technology - which is able to spot known images of child abuse and flag authorities immediately - was deployed across the sites. LinkedIn confirmed that reports about child abuse had been made to the NCMEC, but that instances were extremely rare. Twitter, which is the subject of a campaign by internet activist group Anonymous to do more to quickly remove child abuse images, said it had a no-tolerance approach. A spokesman said: ""When we are made aware of links to images of or content promoting child sexual exploitation they will be removed from the site without further notice and reported to the NCMEC, we permanently suspend accounts promoting or containing updates with links to child sexual exploitation."" No UK law In the UK, there is no law that compels UK communications companies to inform the Cyber Tipline, or any similar service, about child abuse content discovered on their services. In a statement to the BBC, the NCA said: ""The UK internet industry is very small in comparison to the US and no such equivalent legislation currently exists. ""UK internet service providers voluntarily block access to known indecent images of children."" The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) - the UK-based group that actively targets illegal content online - said that while it would be interesting to see the effects a US-style law would have, the UK's impressive record in stamping out child abuse meant existing rules were working. ""Due to the cooperation we have with the online industry in the UK less than 1% of child sexual abuse imagery is hosted here, down from 18% in 1996,"" said Susie Hargreaves, the IWF's chief executive. Ms Hargreaves re-iterated the concerns of the the NCMEC that child abuse images were increasingly being spread on the open internet as well as the dark web. ""This isn't a problem which is only found in hidden areas of the internet,"" she told the BBC. Within a year, the IWF had just four full-time analysts working on monitoring the internet. ""We now have 12 analysts who are still working full time and due to our ability to proactively seek out the images and videos, we're able to identify around three times as many URLs as last year.""

"But several players who have tried to take advantage of the fix have reported being worse off as a consequence. The initial issue led some Xboxes to start downloading an 85 gigabyte file that should have been about 40GB. And some who cancelled this to try again have lost their main game file. As a consequence they have had to download the entire title from scratch, entailing a download of more than 100GB. In theory it should take about four hours to download a file of that size on an average UK home broadband connection. In practice, however, it takes much longer, because the data cannot be downloaded at the maximum speed if there are too many people trying to do so at once. Big update Call of Duty: Modern Warfare's Season 4 update introduces new weapons, narrative video scenes, maps and bug fixes to Activision's first-person shooter. Once downloaded, it takes up only 4GB more storage than the previous version on the hard drive. Even so, some players have expressed concern at the amount of disc space they are having to give up - as the game has had one of the largest file sizes among mainstream games since its release last year. On Sony's PlayStation 4, the installed game can now take up close to 200GB in total - about half disc space available on the basic version. Owners can, however, delete some of the modes they do not play to free up storage for other games and media. The update was originally scheduled to have been made available on 3 June but developer Infinity Ward said it had been held back until now to allow people to focus on voices calling for ""equality, justice and change"" as part of the US protests sparked by the killing of George Floyd. Activision said the latest version of Modern Warfare had been its bestselling Call of Duty game to date, during a recent analysts briefing. The company makes money from each season update as players can pay a fee to unlock new content rather than having to spend hours earning it via a series of in-game achievements.","The makers of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare say they have ""resolved"" a problem that caused updates to the video game to be more than twice the size they should have been."
"The groundbreaking ruling reverses previously tight restrictions on the commercial use of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) - also known as drones, within US airspace. But there are restrictions. The UAS cannot operate at night, and the aircraft need to be inspected before each flight. The US Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said: ""Today's announcement is a significant milestone in broadening commercial UAS use while ensuring we maintain our world-class safety record in all forms of flight. ""These companies are blazing a trail that others are already following, offering the promise of new advances in agriculture and utility safety and maintenance."" The six companies had asked the FAA to grant them exemptions from regulations which address general flight rules, pilot certificate requirements, manuals, maintenance and equipment mandates. In their applications the firms said the operators will hold private pilot certificates, keep the UAS within line of sight at all times and restrict flights to the ""sterile area"" on the set. ""The applicants submitted UAS flight manuals with detailed safety procedures that were a key factor in our approval of their requests,"" said FAA Administrator Michael Huerta in a statement. He added, ""We are thoroughly satisfied these operations will not pose a hazard to other aircraft or to people and property on the ground."" The FAA is currently working on an approval process for a seventh company, Flying-Cam, which filed for exemptions in June. Approved by FAA: Using drones for filming Drone mania Usually confined to military use, drones are increasingly being integrated into the strategies of companies outside the area of defence. Late last year US online retailer Amazon announced the company was testing unmanned drones to deliver goods to customers. The drones, called Octocopters, could deliver packages weighing up to 2.3kg to customers within 30 minutes of them placing the order, according to Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos. However, he added that it could take up to five years for the service to start. Meanwhile Google has built and tested autonomous aerial vehicles, which it believes could be used for goods deliveries. The project is being developed at Google X, the company's clandestine tech research arm, which is also responsible for its self-driving car. Project Wing has been running for two years. Google said that its long-term goal was to develop drones that could be used for disaster relief by delivering aid to isolated areas.","The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has granted permission to six television and movie firms, allowing them to use drones to shoot scenes."
"By Leo KelionTechnology reporter Drawings show a device with a flexible screen that wraps round the wrist, with other parts made of metal and synthetic materials. Other documents reveal the company has registered the names Samsung Gear in South Korea and Samsung Galaxy Gear in the US. Analysts are divided about how much demand there might be. Tech consultancy Canalys has predicted that sales of smartwatches will ""explode"" from 330,000 units shipped last year to more than five million in 2014. ""Smartwatches will be the most important new product category in consumer electronics since the iPad defined the market for tablets,"" said analyst Chris Jones. ""Software platforms tied to smartwatches will also be a tremendous opportunity for developers to write apps in categories such as health and wellness or sports and fitness."" Smartglasses preference But market research company IDC is taking a more tempered view after it surveyed 1,513 consumers in the US. It said only a minority of respondents showed strong interest in any of the suggested features. The most popular application was seeing who is calling your phone from your wrist, with about 14% of those questioned saying they were very interested in it. Reading Twitter or Facebook messages via a watch when a mobile was nearby only appealed to about 7%. ""The small screen size means many of the suggestions didn't seem relevant,"" said Francisco Jeronimo, a mobile device expert at the company. ""We also found there was much more interest in smartglasses, with features such as recording a video or taking pictures of what you are looking at proving most popular. The reason for that is that this offers a new feature that consumers can't get from any other existing device."" South Korean news site Moveplayer revealed that Samsung has filed patents for three slightly different smartwatch designs with the country's patent office since the start of the year. They indicate it is looking at creating a curved bendable screen that covers about half of the device. At one end of the display is a small panel with a back arrow and home keys similar in design to those found on its original Galaxy S Android handset. Range of competitors The drawings also show a physical power button and speaker, and the accompanying descriptions note that the screen can be attached to different straps to accommodate customers' varying wrist sizes. The documents add that the devices should provide access to the internet; be able to make and receive phone calls, emails and texts; and store personal information. Samsung will compete with several other tech firms who have all released, or at least announced, smartwatches since the start of the year, with contrasting marketing campaigns: Many of the predictions about the sector's expected growth are based on news from other companies: confirmation from Microsoft and Samsung that they are working on watch designs, and patent documents from Apple and Google suggesting they are at least considering the concept. 'Beat its rivals' According to IDC's survey Samsung could find it hardest to crack the US market. When IDC asked which of the brands they would most trust to develop a wearable device that embedded communication functions and internet features, 39% picked Apple, 27% Google, 21% Microsoft and just 17% Samsung. This was even though the South Korean company shipped more than double the number of smartphones than its nearest competitor in the quarter to the end of June. ""A similar survey a few years ago would have shown Samsung far behind its rivals when it came to smartphones as well before the Galaxy range became established,"" Mr Jeronimo said. ""If it can beat its rivals over price, ease of use and the amount it spends on advertising, as well as offering unique features - perhaps acting as a TV control in a clever way - then it can still beat other smartwatch brands."" Samsung's next scheduled press event is at the IFA consumer tech show in Berlin on 4 September.",Details of Samsung's smartwatch plans have been revealed in a series of unearthed patent and trademark filings.
"By Maggie ShielsTechnology reporter, BBC News, Silicon Valley The company blamed lack of co-operation from the major record labels. Its product, currently named Music Beta, will now launch in a scaled-down form. Users in the US will be able to upload tracks from their personal collection to Google's servers and play them on Android smartphones and tablet devices. The free service will feature enough space to store 20,000 songs. Google announced its failure to strike the necessary deals at the company's annual developer conference in San Francisco. The web firm said that business and product demands from some labels were too onerous But it stressed that Music Beta was a totally legal service, and that the door had not been closed to future deals. ""We are open to discussion, as long as those discussions are aimed at creating a product and service for end-users that is on a sustainable set of business terms which represents a good value for users,"" Jamie Rosenberg, director of digital content for Android, told BBC News. ""It is in our interest and in our plans to work with the music industry and sell their artists. ""What we are focused on now is that users have existing music collections they have spent time and money acquiring, and giving them access to that music wherever they want it."" Analysts have said there is little doubt that Google has been forced to scale back its ambitions. ""This is not the service they wanted to do, but it is the service they could do without running into all sorts of interference from the record labels,"" said Michael Gartenberg, senior analyst with research firm Gartner. ""It is a step forward, and at least consumers can get used to the idea of storing and accessing music via the cloud."" Half way house Billboard magazine had reported that Sony Music Group and Universal Music Group proved to be the stumbling blocks in Google's hopes to offer a more fully-fledged service. A number of industry watchers said the labels are ignoring the march of progress by being unable to broker deals with services such as those offered by Google, and also by Amazon through its Cloud Player product. ""This whole move to the cloud for music is inevitable, and there is this disconnect between what is possible on the internet and the old business models,"" said Tom Krazit of technology site PaidContent.com. ""At some point, someone will figure out how to make it work, but certainly no-one did today. ""I just think it underlines that the music labels don't really know what they are doing when it comes to the internet, the cloud and distribution. Certainly there is an opportunity there and they are not going after it."" That is also the view of Matt Rosoff, west coast editor for Business Insider, who said Music Beta will be a poorer service as a result. ""It is a half-way house, but I think it is a decent start and underlines that music is moving to the cloud,"" he said. ""The fact that Google wasn't able to sign up the labels means there are going to be some pain points. ""Uploading songs manually takes a long time - I have been told it takes as much as a day to upload 1,000 songs. The label deals would have make this much better."" Google has said there are a number of labels that are keen to be involved in Music Beta, and that they are working together to bring other features to the service. Amazon's Cloud Player also lets users store and manage music collections online. It charges a fee for large amounts of storage. Apple is also expected to enter the fray by announcing an internet-hosted music service at its developer conference next month. Everybody wins At the Google IO conference, the company also announced some impressive figures regarding sales of Android-powered devices. It revealed to a 5,000-strong developer audience that more than 100 million devices have been activated worldwide, and that 400,000-plus devices are being activated daily. In addition, the company said that over 200,000 apps are available via the Android market. In a sideswipe at Apple, Google displayed a visual of the Android logo eating a shiny red apple, indicating that the iPhone is losing out to Android. ""It's hard to believe a little more than two-and-a-half years ago we were just one device, launching in one country on one carrier,"" said Vic Gundotra, senior vice president of engineering. Last month, research firm IDC projected that Android will capture nearly 40% of the global smartphone market by the end of the year. Apple's iOS software is expected to come in at 16%, while BlackBerry will command a 15% market share. In a session with reporters after the keynote speech, Mr Gundotra said the visual was a little bit of fun: ""We try not to take ourselves too seriously. Its great to be in a battle for the hearts and minds of developers, and I think everybody wins.""",Google has been forced to scale back its plans for a cloud-based music service.
"It said the temporary measure would ""reduce opportunities for confusion or abuse"" ahead of results. Facebook has already banned ads that prematurely declare victory in the election.

Conspiracy theory Fight For The Future said misinformation was often spread through Facebook Groups, which are promoted by the social-network's algorithms. On Tuesday, Facebook announced it would remove any Pages, Groups or Instagram accounts representing a conspiracy theory known as QAnon. But the social network has been criticised for deciding not to fact-check posts by politicians. In a blog post, it said it would label politicians' posts, if a candidate or party ""declares premature victory before a race is called by major media outlets"". It will also display notifications directing users to its own voting-information page. Democrat senator Elizabeth Warren, who is often critical of Facebook, said the social network had made ""performative changes"". ""The problem isn't the ads themselves,"" she said. ""The problem is Facebook's refusal to regulate its ads, change its broken algorithm, or take responsibility for the power it's amassed.""

Facebook's policy changes On 3 September, Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg wrote a lengthy blog post about what he and his teams were doing to ""protect our democracy"".

Facebook is responding to concerns groups may try to delegitimise the election result in the the hours and days after polls close. But how much of a problem was paid-for advertising really going to be at that stage in the election? Would a campaign hold back election funds to spend big on adverts to deliberately delegitimise the outcome of the vote? You couldn't bet against it in this election - but it seems unlikely. The real challenge will be for Facebook to stop the spread of misinformation via organic content such as Group or Page posts.

"By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor The first-person mystery adventure was developed by the US indie studio Giant Sparrow. It had not won any of the other categories before taking Best Game. Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice had been the favourite to win having attracted the most nominations. It took the British Game prize and four other awards at the London event. Giant Sparrow previously won a Bafta in 2013 when The Unfinished Swan won Debut Game. The developers said it had taken four years to create their follow-up, which centres on the last surviving member of a family returning to a giant house to find out what had happened to her relatives. Earlier in the evening, What Remains had missed out on the six other prizes for which it had been in the running: Game Design, Game Innovation, Music, Narrative, Original Property and Performer. ""This is incredible,"" said Ian Dallas, the team's creative director. ""I wrote a speech for all the other awards, but this one I figured there would be something in Japanese."" The reference was to Nintendo, which takes home three awards. Super Mario Odyssey took Game Design and Family, while The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild won Game Innovation. PlayStation exclusive Horizon Zero Dawn - the second most nominated game at the event - only took Original Property. Despite the current popularity of Fortnite, the survivor battle game won neither of the two awards it had been nominated for. Instead, Divinity: Original Sin 2 beat it to Multiplayer, while Overwatch took Evolving Game. 'Meaningful games' Hellblade was developed by Cambridge-based studio Ninja Theory. In addition to British Game, it also won Artistic Achievement, Audio Achievement, Best Performer and a new category - Game Beyond Entertainment. The main character is a Pict warrior who has mental health problems brought on by traumatic events. The title had been widely commended for how it handles her psychosis. ""Right now in gaming, there's a big movement towards making games that are more meaningful in nature, that reflect our human experience,"" Tameem Antoniades, the game's director, told the BBC ahead of the ceremony. ""We wanted to tackle something real that affects a lot of people... to actually give a taste of what that feels like."" This year's fellowship was given to Tim Schafer. The American founder of Double Fine Productions was responsible for point-and-click classics including The Secret of Monkey Island, Day of the Tentacle, and Broken Age. ""My career has had so many near-death experiences where it almost ended,"" he said. Mr Schafer added that he hoped his success would now encourage other developers to create unique experiences instead of trying to fit into the established games industry. ""We really want those new voices, new perspectives to come and shake things up,"" he said. ""To come from groups that have not been represented in games so far, and to tell new stories."" Surprise win The Bafta Awards has a habit of bucking expectations with its top trophy. In 2017, Uncharted 4 won Best Game despite losing in seven other categories. In 2016, Fallout 4's only win was the big prize. And in 2015, Destiny carried off a similar trick. Gamers and other developers tweeted their surprise at the latest decision, but did not seem unhappy with the news. Record demand Sales of video games, consoles, PC gaming add-ons and other related products topped £5.1bn in the UK last year, according to trade body Ukie. That marked a record high and a 12.4% improvement on the previous year. The launches of the Nintendo Switch and Microsoft's Xbox One X helped drive interest. But challenges facing the sector include the price of graphics cards - which has been inflated by demand from the crypto-currency industry - as well as slower-than-forecast sales of virtual reality equipment.","What Remains of Edith Finch has scored an upset, winning the top prize at the Bafta Games Awards."
"By Vitaly ShevchenkoBBC Monitoring It says that it is taking steps to combat it. But the official anti-piracy policy is stalling. The government seems undecided on how to tackle the issue. Many Russians think online content should be free. While chairing a meeting on cinema on 17 February, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev embarrassed officials by accessing RuTracker, Russia's most popular file-sharing website. The connection worked despite earlier assurances that the site had been blocked forever. ""So how's your Roskomnadzor blocking it?"" Mr Medvedev asked Communications Minister Nikolay Nikiforov, referring to the ministry's media watchdog. Various explanations followed, ranging from suggestions that Medvedev's government-issue iPad could somehow circumvent restrictions, to claims that he accessed a different, permitted website. But the incident points to possible failings in the government's efforts to fight online piracy. 'Not working' According to Vedomosti, a business daily, Mr Medvedev was responding to remarks by Konstantin Ernst, the head of state-owned Channel One TV, who said that the government's anti-piracy policy was simply not working. The moment illegal content is removed from one website, it appears on another, and even blocked platforms such as RuTracker remain accessible, Mr Ernst reportedly said. President Putin's plain-speaking adviser for the internet, German Klimenko, is similarly downbeat. ""This is madness, it's not working and therefore it puts the government to shame,"" he says of the whole idea of blocking access to websites. According to Mr Klimenko, copyright holders - whom he calls ""greedy ghouls"" - are themselves to blame for the piracy problem. ""Incomes are falling, so why demand people pay for watching a movie?"" he wonders. Earlier, questions were raised about Mr Klimenko's determination to eradicate piracy amid claims that he was linked to Torrnado, another popular Russian torrent-tracking service. He denies this allegation, saying that he does not own the website ""in the legal sense"". Despite the criticism, the government has had some success in stopping Russians from visiting RuTracker. LiveInternet, an online research firm that happens to be owned by Mr Klimenko, has registered a steady decline in traffic to the website from an average of 1.7 million daily visitors in February 2015 to just 758,000 in February this year. Piracy remains rampant But even if access to Russia's most popular file-sharing website becomes problematic, content remains freely available elsewhere. There is little incentive to pay for films or music if they are just a couple of clicks away on the country's most popular social networks, VKontakte and Odnoklassniki. A report by the International Intellectual Property Alliance says VKontakte will generally take down specific content when notified, but ""that is not an adequate enforcement mechanism"" for a problem that VKontakte created. Stiff resistance from a public used to decades of consuming pirated content remains one of the most serious obstacles to any anti-piracy efforts in Russia. In a recent poll, two-thirds of Russians admitted accessing file-sharing platforms, and more than a half said films, music and books should be available on the web for free.

"By Chris BaraniukTechnology reporter If made law, such access would occur via the Investigatory Powers (IP) Act, which includes provisions for the removal of encryption on content. The paper was allegedly leaked to civil liberties body the Open Rights Group, which received the document on 4 May. The Home Office denied there was anything new in the consultation. Phone companies and internet service providers would be asked to provide ""data in near real time"" within one working day, according to one clause in the technical capabilities paper. Such access would need to be sanctioned by secretaries of state and a judge appointed by the prime minister. The paper also echoes the IP Act itself, noting that tech companies would be required to remove - or enable the removal - of encryption from communications as they would need to be provided ""in an intelligible form"" without ""electronic protection"". Cryptographers often describe such access as a ""backdoor"" in the security of communications services. The idea is controversial because some argue it could be exploited by hackers, endangering innocent users. Under the terms of the Investigatory Powers Act, telecoms firms would have to carry out the requirements of any notices to these effects in secret, so the public would be unaware that such access had been given. Simultaneous surveillance could occur in bulk, but be limited to one in every 10,000 users of a given service - a maximum of roughly 900 of BT's 9 million British broadband customers, for instance. A consultation about the paper - due to end on 19 May - is allegedly under way at the moment, though this was not publicly announced by the government. It does not have a legal obligation notify the public about draft regulations, which would have to be passed by both Houses of Parliament in order to become law. However, the paper suggests that the regulations have already been seen by the UK's Technical Advisory Board. A BT spokesman confirmed the company had received ""a copy of draft regulations, to be made under the Investigatory Powers Act 2016, in relation to technical capability notices"" - but did not comment further. 'Security risk' ""The public has a right to know about government powers that could put their privacy and security at risk,"" said Jim Killock, executive director of the Open Rights Group, explaining the decision to publish the document. ""It seems very clear that the Home Office intends to use these to remove end-to-end encryption - or more accurately to require tech companies to remove it,"" said Dr Cian Murphy, a legal expert at the University of Bristol who has criticised the scope of the IP act. ""I do read the regulations as the Home Office wanting to be able to have near real-time access to web chat and other forms of communication,"" he told the BBC. Home Secretary Amber Rudd has previously argued that the Investigatory Powers Act is necessary to curb ""new opportunities for terrorists"" afforded by the internet. In March, Ms Rudd's comments that encrypted messaging services like WhatsApp should not be places ""for terrorists to hide"" caused much debate. Surveillance of some mobile phone user data in ""as near real-time as possible"" has already been available to law enforcement authorities for many years, noted Dr Steven Murdoch at University College London.

"The program had previously been created in the HTML5 language. A team of engineers has now rewritten it in Objective-C and says it should now respond to commands twice as quickly. The move may encourage users to spend more time using the program, increasing their exposure to adverts. It previously warned the wrong mobile strategy would damage profits. The move effectively returns the social network's app back to its roots. The first version had in fact been written in Objective-C, but the developer, Joe Hewitt, quit the project in November 2009 in protest against Apple's insistence that software had to be reviewed before being added to its store. He was replaced by a team of engineers who subsequently released an app with a wider range of features which they decided to write in HTML5. The choice was made to allow them to write a single version of the product that would run on both Apple's iOS and Google's Android systems, as well as via the web. This made it easier to make changes to the multiple platforms simultaneously. However, it also led to complaints including a viewpoint written by one developer for the BBC earlier this year. ""The existing app suffers from endless loading, refresh problems and feels more like using a website from the late 90's,"" wrote Malcolm Barclay. ""To put it another way, it is like listening to a transistor radio... HTML5 can run on many different devices (eg Android), hence it costs less to maintain and there's no need to make separate apps. I doubt Facebook really benefited from this - users certainly did not."" Speed bump Mick Johnson, product manager at Facebook, said he did not think the company had made a mistake in using HTML5 since it had helped the firm get the product to this point. But he added that the rewrite to ""native code"" should mean users would notice a difference, even though there had been only minor tweaks to the app's look. ""We tried to look at what is the core Facebook mobile experience and eliminate the pain points,"" he said. ""The three things we really focused on were opening the application, scrolling through the news feed and tapping into and viewing a photo. So we made all those things twice as fast."" He added that the rewrite had taken more than half a year to complete, but had no information about efforts to improve its counterpart on Android. Advertising revenues The announcement follows Facebook's efforts to increase the amount of advertising on its apps. Earlier this month it announced third-party app developers could start placing ads in users' mobile-device news feeds. If a user clicks on one of the links, they will be redirected to the appropriate app store from where they can purchase the software. Facebook charges a fee for each click. It has also introduced Sponsored Stories - posts created by an advertiser that appear if a ""friend"", or page the user is connected to, shares the material. By paying a fee, the business or organisation can increase the likelihood their posts will be seen. The firm is under pressure to boost its revenues after its shares more than halved in price since the firm's flotation in May. There were also concerns raised earlier this week after it emerged that Peter Thiel, a member of its board, had sold most of his stake in the company for nearly $400m (£252m).",Facebook has rewritten its iPhone and iPad app from scratch to address complaints that it was slow to use.
"By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor The Surface 3 is powered by an Intel processor, unlike the ARM-based chip in the Surface 2. That means it uses the Windows 8 operating system, rather than the more limited Windows RT. Experts suggest the move could help Microsoft replicate the success of its higher-specification Surface Pro 3. The bigger tablet, which was launched 10 months ago, features a 12in (30.5cm) screen, compared with the 10.8in display of the new Surface 3. Shipments of Surface tablets rose from 1.8 million units in the last three months of 2013 to 2.1 million units for the same period in 2014, according to research group Canalys, with the Pro 3 accounting for the bulk of demand since it went on sale. Microsoft's share of the tablet market has grown from 2.3% to 3.2% as a result, while Apple has seen sales of its iPad decline, although it remains the bestselling brand. Microsoft markets the Pro 3 as ""the tablet that can replace your laptop"", and is using similar language for the new model. But it will target the Surface 3 at those on tighter budgets such as students and schools, and mobile workers who may want a lighter, smaller design. ""For people that need to get stuff done, generally you need a keyboard and some people need a pen, and that's where our device plays,"" said Dale Perrigo, a Surface marketing manager. ""If you want a pure entertainment that's not what this device is."" The release date is 7 May. Price shift The basic version of the Surface 3 - featuring 64 gigabytes of storage, 2GB of RAM and an Intel Atom x7 processor - costs £419. That is about a third lower than the £639 price tag of the cheapest Surface Pro 3, but about two-thirds more than the £259 that had been charged for the basic Surface 2, which had less storage. The touchscreen pen and keyboard cover are not included, and add £155 to the cost. ""Because it's an Atom processor it is under-powered compared to the Pro 3, which has plenty of horsepower,"" commented Tim Coulling, an analyst at Canalys. ""So, it's not going to suit everyone as a notebook replacement and will be for people who only want it for lighter productivity tasks. ""But there are a lot of those people out there."" Fanless but thick Using Windows 8 rather than Windows RT - with the offer of a free upgrade to Windows 10 when it becomes available - means the entry-level Surface gains access to more programs. The Surface 2, for example, had been unable to run the full version of Photoshop, CorelDraw, Spotify, World of Warcraft or Google Chrome. The new model's Atom-class chip does, however, mean the Surface 3 will struggle with some processor-intensive programs - such as video editors, computer-aided design (CAD) software and graphics-intensive games - which the Pro 3 model will be more suited for. The new tablet is fanless, but significantly thicker - at 8.7mm (0.34in) - than many of its rivals in order to incorporate a standard USB 3.0 socket. That makes it 30% thicker than both Dell's Android-based Venue 8 7840 and Apple's iPad Air 2, and 13% deeper than the tablet part of Asus's Windows-powered Transformer Book T300 Chi. ""We optimised for a port that enables connections to the largest number of devices and peripherals possible,"" explained a Microsoft spokeswoman. Apple and Google recently released computers with a smaller type of cable port that can transfer data at double the speed, called USB-C. Mr Coulling said the technology could lead to slimmer Surfaces, but added that it might have been too early to adopt the technology. ""The Surface 3 would have been thinner had Microsoft included it, but then users would have had to worry about adding converters or upgrading their peripherals,"" he said. ""But I think it will be there in the next revision of the product."" Schools and offices Another expert suggested the new tablets should further boost Microsoft's tablet sales, but warned they could put some of the firm's business relationships under strain. ""Right now there is a huge battle going on in the education space to ensure the next generations of users stay familiar with and loyal to Microsoft rather than solutions from Google and others,"" said Martin Garner from the CCS Insight consultancy. ""Microsoft is also clearly going after business users - with Office 365 bundled in, it's the sort of device companies will give to workers who are regularly on the move. ""So, the new Surface 3 is a welcome move, but it will put Microsoft into increasing competition with its partners who make Windows-powered products, such as Dell and Lenovo.""","Microsoft has refreshed its tablet line-up with a new entry-level device that runs more software, but is also more expensive than its predecessor."
"By Prof Alan WoodwardDepartment of Computing, University of Surrey Not surprisingly, some contain very sensitive information and much effort goes into making sure these messages are unreadable by anyone other than the intended recipients. This is the essence of cryptography. But, there is another option: hiding messages in plain sight, the electronic equivalent of invisible ink. We can think of all messages as falling into one of three categories: Although you don't realise it, you are probably using steganography already in your everyday electronic lives as it is used extensively to ""digitally watermark"" electronic data with information such as the copyright owner. New technologies have emerged that are capable of holding considerable amounts of information, whilst having no perceptible effect on the object being digitally watermarked. Photographs, music and even e-books all use forms of this technology, as a deterrent to bootleggers. Missing missense Whilst digital watermarks are intended to hold information such as copyright data, the techniques can also be used to embed hidden messages in digital objects, and this poses a problem for any law enforcement agencies trying to conduct surveillance. If something is sent ""in the clear"", you can set up filters to look or words of interest and use those to trigger a closer look at the data in question. Even better if something that looks like nonsense. It is quite likely to be of interest. After all if someone has gone to all the trouble of encrypting data to make it look like nonsense then you can assume that it is something the sender values, and hence something worth paying much closer attention to. However, anything that is sent as ""missense"" is highly likely to be missed, as it will look to all the world like some innocent piece of data. It is the classic conjuring trick of misdirection. This matters in the modern world as the volumes of data that any eavesdropper has to sift through are vast. No-one can analyse every piece of data that could potentially be captured and so if a piece of data looks like, say, a picture but actually it contains a secret hidden document, no-one will know to conduct further analysis on that picture. Governments and the military are not the only ones who want to pass messages securely. Criminal code Obvious candidates are terrorist groups and organised crime. Those who may have reason to think they may be under surveillance may find steganography very appealing, as such messages need not be passed using simple email. Imagine, for example, someone posting apparently innocent photographs on a social media site, but the item actually contains the secret message. The whole world can see it but only those who know where to look can see the intended message. And what about a disgruntled employee using his/her work email to send a picture of the children to a friend but actually they are shipping out your most commercially sensitive information? Your intellectual capital could be disappearing before your eyes and you'd never know it even if you read all of their emails. Reading between the letters It is sometimes difficult to know even what type of object can hide a message. Some very innovative forms have emerged in recent years. One of those I found most impressive was where the spacing of letters on a web page varied very subtly but in such a way that it conveyed hidden messages. You could read the pages quite normally and learn all about the tourist spot or whatever was being described, but all along you were looking at hidden data that you didn't recognise as such. There is also a way of having the best of both worlds: encrypt a secret and then embed it using steganography. In this way, even if the hidden message was detected, it could not be read. However, whilst the research into digital watermarking continues to mature, the research into detection of hidden messages is still in its infancy. Decoding encrypted messages (so called cryptanalysis) has long been studied, with efforts such as those at Bletchley Park during World War II being rightly celebrated. Detection of hidden messages - known as steganalysis - has no such pedigree. In part this is because various studies of large data sets on the internet failed to detect the use of steganography, and so it is not considered a threat. But, if the hiding techniques used were advanced enough, the immaturity of the detection techniques means that these studies were fundamentally flawed. So will message hiding ever be widely used? I think it inevitable that the bad guys on the internet are already using these techniques. There are freely available tools to enable you to do all of what I have described above, and these tools continue to advance. What is required is proper funding of the detection techniques, or at the minimum, some more reliable method of determining if steganography is being used for hiding messages en masse, if we are to have a proper understanding of the threat. Alan Woodward is a visiting professor at the University of Surrey's department of computing. He has worked for the UK government and still provides advice on issues including cybersecurity, covert communications and forensic computing.",Is there a hidden threat right under our noses?

"Currently the taxi-booking app relies on Google's mapping technology to display local maps and mark pick-up locations. But a senior Uber executive says that more relevant information can be drawn if it produces its own road maps. The firm is said to be investing $500m (£380m) in the mapping project. ""Existing maps are a good starting point, but some information isn't that relevant to Uber, like ocean topography,"" said Brian McClendon, who up until 2014 was vice-president of Google Maps. Writing on Uber's website, Mr McClendon said: ""There are other things we need to know a lot more about, like traffic patterns and precise pick-up and drop-off locations."" ""Moreover, we need to be able to provide a seamless experience in parts of the world where there aren't detailed maps, or street signs,"" he added. Last year, Uber began scanning roads across the US using mapping cars, which can track the geographical position of each street and motorway. The firm said that these vehicles will be operational in Mexico ""this summer"", as part of a wider plan to use these vehicles in big cities around the world.

"The Competition and Market Authority is taking the ticketing website to court, alleging it has not done enough to change its business practices. It says it is ""working with the CMA"". Last year, the Football Association, the trade body UK Music and some MPs signed an open letter to senior Google executives, urging it to stop Viagogo from advertising. In a statement on Wednesday, Google said: ""When people use our platform for help in purchasing tickets, we want to make sure that they have an experience they can trust. ""This is why we have strict policies and take necessary action when we find an advertiser in breach."" In response, Viagogo said: ""We were extremely surprised to learn of Google's concerns today. We are confident that there has been no breach of Google's policies and look forward to working with them to resolve this as quickly as possible."" The CMA initially launched legal action against Viagogo in August last year, over concerns it was breaking consumer-protection law. As a result, a court ordered the company to overhaul the way it did business, including telling buyers: Now, the CMA alleges that Viagogo is ignoring its demands to make changes and plans to launch legal proceedings for contempt of court.

"By Chris BaraniukTechnology reporter Several developers complained via social media that their apps, which they said had nothing to do with gambling, were taken down. The affected apps included a Polish magazine, a gif-sharing service and a platform for sending clips of Xbox games to friends. The BBC has contacted Apple for comment. A message sent to affected developers said that Apple was removing gambling-related apps made by individuals in an effort to ""reduce fraudulent activity... and comply with government requests to address illegal online gambling activity"". Recently, Norway succeeded in getting Apple to ban all gambling apps from its App Store in the country, although the recent removals appear to have been effected worldwide. Some of the removed apps are now coming back online. ""Apple says these apps contain gambling but they don't reveal how they have detected this,"" said Simon Stovring, a Copenhagen-based developer behind a gif-sharing app called Gifferent. ""It seems like an unfortunate but honest mistake,"" he told the BBC. Mr Stovring said about 10 fellow-developers had contacted him to say that they too had been hit by the ban. Wojtek Pietrusiewicz, co-owner of the Polish app iMagazine, said it had also been ""caught in the crossfire"". 'Angry comment' He said he thought the removal might have occurred because the app contains access to the wider internet, which allows users to potentially click through to gambling content. The app, which has thousands of users, was down for a total of 15 hours. While it didn't cause any serious issues, Mr Pietrusiewicz said it did result in ""one angry comment from a reader and a lot of stress for our team"". Another developer, Niall Watchorn, also watched as his app for sharing Xbox game footage was reinstated after several hours. ""It was very frustrating though, as my app has just started gaining traction,"" he told the BBC.",Apple has been accused of accidentally removing apps from the App Store in a crackdown on gambling content.
"The data breach has only recently come to light after being discovered by security researcher Troy Hunt. Mr Hunt said he was impressed with the company's swift response. Imgur said in a statement that no other personal data had been taken as it did not collect information such as real names and phone numbers. ""We apologise that this breach occurred and the inconvenience it has caused you,"" wrote Roy Sehgal, Imgur's chief operating officer, in a blog post. Mr Sehgal said Imgur was ""still investigating"" but its former encryption method - a hashing algorithm - may have been ""cracked with brute force"". That algorithm had been replaced in 2016, he added. ""We recommend that you use a different combination of email and password for every site and application,"" he wrote. ""Please always use strong passwords and update them frequently."" Troy Hunt tweeted that Imgur had released a statement 25 hours after he had contacted the company. ""This is really where we're at now: people recognise that data breaches are the new normal and they're judging organisations not on the fact that they've had one but on how they've handled it when it's happened,"" he wrote. This month it was revealed that ride-hailing app Uber had concealed a 2016 data breach affecting 57 million users and drivers. It also admitted to paying the hackers $100,000 (£75,000) to delete the stolen data. ""None of this should have happened,"" said chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi.",Image-sharing website Imgur has confirmed that the emails and passwords of 1.7 million users were compromised in 2014.
"Dave LeeNorth America technology reporter Reuters reported that the companies were in negotiations but no deal had been agreed. The move would enable Google to produce its own smartwatches. It already develops a version of Android for wearables. Fitbit's share price increased by 19% before being suspended. Google has not commented. A spokeswoman for Fitbit said it ""does not comment on rumours or speculation"". Reuters did not say what sum had been offered. It emerged in September that Fitbit, currently valued by the markets at around $1.4bn (£1.1bn) after Monday's surge, was touting itself for a sale. Fitbit, which in its latest quarterly earnings posted a loss of $68.5m, is looking precarious as a standalone entity since bigger firms have gained a strong footing in wearable technology. ""A key tipping point is likely to have been Apple's decision to price its Series 3 Apple Watch at $199/£199,"" said Leo Gebbie, from the consultancy CCS Insight. ""That will have put immense pressure on Fitbit's own products, which are already feeling the challenge from low-cost rivals such as [China's] Xiaomi."" In an attempt to diversify its income, Fitbit has expanded into other areas - including monitoring users' breathing during sleep, and diabetes management. But the firm trails Huawei, Apple and Xiaomi in fitness tech sales. For Google the deal, if confirmed, would represent a renewed effort to develop its Wear OS platform. ""Although Google has been lukewarm in its commitment to wearables recently, this indicates it is serious about the segment and could provide a strong boost to its ambitions,"" Mr Gebbie added. CCS Insight predicted 142 million wearable devices would be sold worldwide this year, at a value of $17.1bn. Meanwhile, Google's parent company Alphabet released its third quarter results which showed a drop in net profit to $7bn in the three months to 30 September. Analysts had been expecting profit of $8.8bn. It fell from $9bn in same period last year when changes to US tax law had boosted Alphabet's bottom line. Total third quarter revenue rose by 20% to $40.5bn.",Shares in fitness device maker Fitbit were suspended on Monday after a report said Google had bid to buy the firm.
"By Zoe KleinmanTechnology reporter, BBC News Her DIY solution to a neighbour's internet connectivity problems in 2009 has evolved into B4RN, an internet service provider offering fast one gigabit per second broadband speeds to the parishes which nestle in the picturesque Lune Valley. That is 35 times faster than the 28.9 Mbps average UK speed internet connection according to Ofcom. It all began when the trees which separated Chris's neighbouring farm from its nearest wireless mast - their only connection to the internet, provided by Lancaster University - grew too tall. Something more robust was required, and no alternatives were available in the area, so Chris decided to take matters into her own hands. She purchased a kilometre of fibre-optic cable and commandeered her farm tractor to dig a trench. After lighting the cable, the two farms were connected, with hers feeding the one behind the trees. ""We dug it ourselves and we lit [the cable] ourselves and we proved that ordinary people could do it,"" she says. ""It wasn't rocket science. It was three days of hard work."" Her motto, which she repeats often in conversation, is JFDI. Three of those letters stand for Just Do It. The fourth you can work out for yourself. And JFDI she has. B4RN now claims to have laid 2,000 miles (3,218km) of cable and connected a string of local parishes to its network. It won't connect a single household, so the entire parish has to be on board before it will begin to build. Each household pays £30 per month with a £150 connection fee and larger businesses pay more. Households must also do some of the installation themselves. The entire infrastructure is fibre-optic cable right to the property, rather than just to the cabinet, with existing copper phone lines running from that to the home, as generally offered by British Telecom. The service is so popular that the company has work lined up for the next 10 years and people from as far as Sierra Leone have attended the open days it holds a couple of times a year. The bulk of the work is done by volunteers, although there are now 15 paid staff also on board. Farmers give access to their land and those with equipment like diggers and tractors do the heavy work. However other landowners can charge - B4RN has complained on its Facebook page about the price of cabling under a disused railway bridge owned by Highways England. A spokesperson told the BBC these are ""standard industry costs"" which include a £4,500 fee for surveying, legal fees and a price per metre for the cable installation. While B4RN has yet to make a profit, once it has paid back its shareholders it should be in good financial health - although one of the conditions is that profits must be ploughed back into the community. Chris's services to rural broadband have recognised by the Queen - she was awarded an MBE in 2015, alongside Barry Forde, a retired university lecturer who now leads the co-operative. Incredibly, many B4RN customers had been surviving on dial-up services or paying high fees for satellite feeds. Chris says that some still are. With farmers having to register online with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) within five days of every calf being born in order for it to enter the food chain, connectivity is vital. ""All the farmers who haven't got broadband have to rely on land agents or auction marts or public wi-fi spaces which we haven't got round here either, or paying somebody to do it,"" says Chris. ""What the farmers were finding was the dial-up just couldn't cope with it. ""They bought satellites, but then the children would use all the satellite feed to do their things and then they came to use it at night and there was no feed left, they'd gone over the data and they were being charged a fortune for what they then used. ""So the farmers have been incredibly supportive of this and that's why they've given us free rein throughout the fields, which we go through to connect them and then we get to the villages which subsidise the farmers' connections. ""You couldn't do it just for the farmers alone, but you couldn't get to the village without the farmers so it's tit for tat."" There are other independent fibre broadband providers out there, like Gigaclear which serves around 50,000 customers based in several UK counties and Hyperoptic which is active in 13 cities. They all claim to offer 1Gbps speeds. ""The best way to make sure this country catches up is to support the alternative networks,"" says Chris. ""Wherever there's competition BT will then up their game. ""We can't do the whole country. [BT, Virgin etc] are good businesses. They are in it to make a profit, that's what businesses are supposed to do."" Openreach, currently a division of BT, owns the UK's largest broadband infrastructure. ""The big picture is that we've got a plan, alongside the government, to get to 95% UK fibre coverage,"" said Kim Mears, Openreach's managing director of Infrastructure Delivery. The provider has also upgraded 90 small communities through its Community Fibre Partnership, set up to work in areas it describes as ""hard to reach"". Ms Mears appealed to those struggling with poor connectivity to make contact. ""There is lots available if communities come together. We are really sitting here waiting to help,"" she said.","""I'm just a farmer's wife,"" says Christine Conder, modestly. But for 2,300 members of the rural communities of Lancashire she is also a revolutionary internet pioneer."
"That's the equivalent of nearly two billion search queries. As news that she had fined its parent company Alphabet a record 2.4bn euros ($2.7bn; £2.1bn) spread, it became clear that many thought the case against the tech firm was obvious without needing to dive that deep into the data. But others perceive the penalty to be unfair and even prejudicial against the US, despite the fact several American firms had spoken out against Google in advance of the ruling. For its part, Google says it does not accept the criticism and may appeal. Below is a sample of the early reactions to the news culled from emailed press releases, social media, blogs and elsewhere. Foes... ""For over a decade Google has abused and leveraged its monopoly power in search - where it has a 95% market share in Europe... The commission's decision will finally put a stop to that abusive conduct, and it will enable those competitors that have survived despite Google's behaviour, as well as new entrants, to compete on their merits,"" Thomas Vinje, legal counsel to Fairsearch, a group of internet businesses that have lobbied against Google. ""Further legal action will be needed if Google tries to circumvent the commission's verdict. It will be important to have a very strong monitoring trustee and oversight to ensure that the remedy is put into practice,"" Richard Stables, chief executive of the price comparison site Kelkoo. ""Other regulators and companies have been intimidated by Google's overwhelming might, but the commission has taken a strong stand and we hope that this is the first step in remedying Google's shameless abuse of its dominance in search. We strongly believe that the abuse of algorithms by dominant digital platforms should be of concern to every country and company seeking a fair, competitive and creative society,"" News Corp via its site. ...and friends ""[It's] eurotechnopanic at its worst: anti-American, anti-technology, anti-capitalism... Europe, you can't regulate yourself into competition. You have to invest and innovate,"" Prof Jeff Jarvis, author of What Would Google Do? via Twitter. ""The EU has effectively decided that some companies have become too big to innovate. The EU's actions have created a cloud of uncertainty that will make large tech companies overly cautious about making changes to the user experience and service offerings that would benefit consumers... The only real beneficiary of today's ruling is the EU's treasury,"" Robert Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a Washington-based think tank. ""Prioritising a particular shopping search engine is not akin to gouging water users with higher prices because there are alternatives to Google that users can switch to easily. If the overall user experience is made worse by Google Shopping being prioritised, then users will have the option of moving to a search engine like Bing which is perhaps less good at search but better overall because it does not prioritise a bad shopping tool,"" Sam Bowman, executive director, Adam Smith Institute via its website. The commentators ""Given the depth of Google's pockets, this is by no means a commercial disaster but it has the makings of a brand disaster. Google has always presented itself as 'the good guy' of technology, but if this record fine stands then it would be harder for them to argue that,"" Rupert Bhatia, director of public relations at crisis management agency Rhizome Media. ""Prepare to see more such divided action (geographically based)... but [it's] not simply America v EU. Some huge US companies (Oracle) agree with the EU fine, saying Google hurts competition."" Adrian Weckler, tech editor, The Irish Independent via Twitter. ""It's simply not possible for us to operate a complex economy without certainty... Vital to this is that we all know what the law is ahead of time. It must be possible for us to know that we are acting illegally that is, the law must be known, it must be possible for us to know that we are subject to it. And that's where this decision fails,"" Tim Worstall, Adam Smith Institute via Forbes. ""Alphabet can easily afford [the fine]. The sting may come more from what the ruling means for current and future cases in Europe targeting Google and other large tech firms - most of them hailing from Silicon Valley or thereabouts. Antitrust experts and tech executives say the ruling, in particular, could be precedent-setting in instances where tech giants have become gatekeepers for our digital lives,"" Sam Schechner, Wall Street Journal via its site. ""Whereas the antitrust laws in the US and the EU used to be broadly in line with each other, a gradual deregulation in the US has led to the clash of cultures we are seeing here. The vast success of Silicon Valley has been fostered by a deregulated marketplace, but this causes problems when these businesses do business against the very different legal backdrop operating in Europe,"" Susan Hall, head of technology at the law firm Clarke Willmott. ""So, the EU has fined Google for breaking competition law and given it 90 days to stop, but not said what stopping looks like. Anyone find that odd?"" James Titcomb, Technology editor, The Telegraph via Twitter The public ""They are dominant, but other search engines are available. When I go into Tesco I don't see adverts for Lidl,"" Tony Smith via Facebook. ""Last time I checked Google was a technology company, not a public body. Why is it wrong to favour its advertisers?!"" Desi Velikova via Twitter. ""It's a huge win for the average consumer. Every year Google becomes a more and more entrenched monopoly. At this point they basically dictate a big portion of the internet ecosystem,"" ReanimatedX via Reddit. ""I'd like to hear an explanation as to why this is good for consumers. Instead, more people are going to just go straight to Amazon, which uses its data to learn what people like, develops its own products to compete, and then stops carrying competitors' products,"" Tenushi via Reddit.",The EU's Competition Commissioner said her team analysed a gigantic 5.2 terabytes of search results before determining that Google had indeed abused its position by running its Shopping service price comparison ads at the top of search results.
"Several anti-malware apps made by Trend Micro have since been updated by the cyber-security company. However, Trend Micro strongly denied allegations that the apps had been ""stealing user data"" and sending it to a server in China. The apps' behaviour was noticed by a security researcher last week. Three apps, Dr Cleaner, Dr Antivirus and App Uninstall, made by Trend Micro, were removed from the Apple Mac app store, though the tech giant has not publicly confirmed why. ""Reports that Trend Micro is 'stealing user data' and sending them to an unidentified server in China are absolutely false,"" said Trend Micro in a statement. It added that it had completed an initial investigation which had confirmed that several apps, including Dr Cleaner and Dr Antivirus, had collected and uploaded ""a small snapshot of the browser history on a one-time basis"" at installation. The firm said this was done for ""security purposes"", in order to analyse whether a user had recently encountered adware or other threats. However, it added that it had decided to remove this function from the apps. In an update to the statement, Trend Micro said, ""We apologise to our community for concern they might have felt and can reassure all that their data is safe and at no point was compromised.""

Owners are being told to contact the companies responsible, which should fix the problem or issue a full refund. Models involved include: A spokeswoman for Swagway told the BBC that it would be retrofitting the X1s it received with new ""UL-certified"" battery packs. ""UL-Certification means that the product has been tested by Underwriters Laboratories, one of the largest consumer products testing labs in the world,"" she explained.

Customers are also being asked to return a further 5,000 Swagway hoverboards distributed in Canada. House fires This is not the first time the self-balancing scooters have been flagged as a safety risk. In December, the UK's Trading Standards agencies seized more than 38,000 hoverboards it said were at danger of overheating after several house fires were blamed on the products. The authorities had already said it was an offence to ride them on pavements and roads. In the US, Amazon pulled some boards from sale and began offering customers full refunds in January after the Consumer Product Safety Commission voiced its concerns.

"In a blog post put up late on 23 December, it said it was handling 90% of its typical call volume. Audio, video and instant messaging systems that run over the Skype network were now running normally, it said. Skype said the fault had been caused by a ""software issue"" on critical parts of its network. ""We take outages like this really seriously and apologise for the inconvenience,"" Skype chief Tony Bates told BBC News. In a blog post, the company said that it would offer compensation in the form of call credit vouchers to its paying customers. The only services left to fix were offline instant messaging and group video calls. It said the problems that took the service offline were not caused by a malicious attack. It hoped to publish a more in-depth explanation in the near future. Business failure In an earlier post, the firm said that the problem had been caused by a series of ""supernode"" failures. These ""act a bit like phone directories"", the firm said, routing traffic between users. ""If you want to talk to someone, and your Skype app can't find them immediately (for example, because they're connecting from a different location or from a different device) your computer or phone will first try to find a supernode to figure out how to reach them,"" it read. ""Under normal circumstances, there are a large number of supernodes available. Unfortunately, today, many of them were taken offline by a problem affecting some versions of Skype."" The firm said its engineers had tried to create ""mega-supernodes"" to get around the problem. BBC reader Igor Hnatko, who runs an outsourcing company in Kuala Lumpar, Malaysia, said his firm had been ""severely affected"" by the outage. ""It had made me realise to what extent my business is dependent on VOIP technology and Skype as a solution to keeping in touch with clients, and employees,"" he said.

"By James ClaytonNorth America technology reporter The update applies to all new content, including videos from President Donald Trump. The company had previously labelled potentially misleading election videos, adding links to accurate information. YouTube said ""enough states have certified their election results to determine a president-elect"". Democrats have criticised YouTube for not doing enough to take down fake news and conspiracy theories on the platform. Mr Trump and senior Republicans have repeatedly made unsubstantiated claims that the election was ""rigged"". Trump's lawyers have failed to provide evidence of this. The announcement comes after a ""safe harbour"" deadline - which sets a date by which states need to certify the results of the presidential election. ""Yesterday was the safe harbour deadline for the US Presidential election and enough states have certified their election results to determine a President-elect,"" said YouTube. It also said that the move was in line with its historical approach to US presidential elections. Examples it cited of videos it would now remove were uploads claiming that a presidential candidate won the election due to widespread software glitches or counting errors. Last month Reuters identified several YouTube channels making money from ads and memberships that were amplifying debunked accusations about voting fraud. YouTube said that it has taken down 8,000 channels since September, for uploading ""harmful and misleading elections-related videos for violating our existing policies"".

"By Mark WardTechnology correspondent, BBC News Then there is an elite for whom building a modern PC is mere tinkering. Instead, they opt for the much more difficult task of building their own microprocessor from individual components. They make it easier for themselves by emulating the relatively low-powered processors found in the first personal computers. That's a sensible step given that the microprocessors inside a contemporary PC have millions, if not billions, of transistors on board. Wiring or soldering those would take several lifetimes. Parts list But that takes nothing away from the complexity of building a processor from parts. Even a simple one can take months, often years, to put together. One of the first to do a DIY processor was Bill Buzbee who made one from TTL logical chips, 74 of them in all. Before microprocessors were invented, early computers used scores, sometimes hundreds of simple integrated circuits wired together to create a central processing unit. Such systems are known as Transistor to Transistor Logic (TTL) ""Back in the 70s when I first got involved in computers and electronics, TTL chips were what people used, so that's what I turned to,"" said Mr Buzbee. Despite starting his working life as a journalist, he became a programmer and embarked on the task to firm up his knowledge of how hardware worked. ""It started out to be a very small project and it grew to something much more elaborate,"" he said. Help and advice came from the many people who found his project blog, a journal he used to organise his thoughts about how to build the processor and incorporate that into a working computer. ""I have had a lot of help, most of it unsolicited, from electrical engineers,"" he said. Some of the parts for what would become Magic-1 were bought specifically for the job. But, true to the DIY philosophy, many others were lying around in Mr Buzbee's home. Using store-bought and found components, the design for the machine evolved organically. ""It's not so much that I designed the computer and got the parts for that,"" he said. ""I designed around what parts I had."" As it turned out, building the processor and its associated hardware was just part of the challenge. The novel machine needed feeding with software, including a compiler and assembler, if it was to do anything useful. ""The biggest part of the job by far was all the software,"" he said. ""The vast majority of the time was doing that."" Was it time well spent? ""I learned a fantastic amount,"" he said, ""I came into it with a reasonably good knowledge, but this opened up a lot of areas that I did not have much exposure to."" Mr Buzbee had the foresight to video the first working test of Magic-1 and his exclamation of ""Outstanding!"" as the machine does what it is supposed to sums up the project and its results. Making machines The trail blazed by Mr Buzbee has been followed by many others. Computer scientist Dr Harry Porter built his 8-bit machine from relays - electronic switches that are even simpler than the transistors used in Magic-1. Despite this, the machine has all the bits you would expect to find in a smaller processor. Relays are also a good deal bigger than transistors so the Relay Computer occupies four large wooden cabinets and makes a rhythmic clickety-clack racket when its 8-bit might is being used to crunch numbers. One of the most recent homebrew CPUs is the Big Mess o'Wires (BMOW) made by Steve Chamberlin from a whole lot of logic chips. Like many of the other DIY processor folks, he started small but. Over time, the design and his ambitions for it grew. ""My goal was only to tinker around with digital electronics projects of the sort I remembered fondly from university days,"" he said, adding that he expected that once it was built he would program and play with it via a terminal window connection to a modern PC. ""After I got the basics working, though, I kept revising my goals and adding more and more external systems,"" he said. The finished BMOW has a keyboard, VGA video, audio and is programmed using Basic. ""BMOW grew into a stand-alone computer system, independent of any PC, and roughly similar in capabilities to 8-bit computers of the early 1980s,"" he told the BBC. The journey from bits to finished computer taught him a huge amount about how computers work and the challenges that faced those early computer makers. ""I feel I have a much better appreciation for what it must have been like when Steve Wozniak designed the original Apple, or other homebrew systems of the day,"" he said.",Some people like to build their own computers. A smaller number like to modify them to boost the speed of the processor and make them more powerful.
"The Yahoo China home page now redirects users to a site run by Alibaba, which manages Yahoo's Chinese operation.

"By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor It follows suggestions third-party software had been used to steal intimate photos of celebrities - posted online last month - from iCloud. The action should stop the tool from being able to infiltrate Apple's internet storage service if the safety measure is implemented. However, the security facility remains an opt-in choice. One expert suggested that Apple should instead make it the default option. The process works by introducing an extra step after an account holder has typed their username and password into a device they have not used before. They are also required to enter a four-digit code that is either texted to a trusted mobile phone number or sent via Apple's Find My iPhone app. If the person does not enter the code, they are refused access to iCloud and are blocked from making an iTunes, iBooks, or App Store purchase. They can, however, use a 14-character recovery key to regain access to the account in the event their trusted device is lost or stolen. They are told to keep this in a safe place to avoid being locked out. While Apple had offered the two-step verification system in the past, until now it had not come into play when device owners used the firm's back-up service. That meant that even if people had switched on the two-step feature to prevent cyber-thieves logging into their accounts with a stolen or guessed password, the attackers could still download a complete back-up of their data by using Elcomsoft's Phone Password Breaker. Several hackers' forums contain discussions about using of pirated copies of Elcomsoft's ""forensic"" software, which is marketed as a tool for law enforcement agencies to access iCloud content without needing to be in possession of a suspect's iPhone or iPad. ElmcomSoft's Moscow-based owner told the BBC earlier this month that he believed his software had been used in the recent hacks, as it was ""the only one able to do that"". He has now acknowledged that Apple's changes guard against the technique he had used. ""I think that implementation is secure, and so there is no workaround,"" Vladimir Katalov told the BBC, adding that his program could no longer even get a list of devices and back-ups linked to a user's account. ""The other security improvement, which I like, is that now the owner of the Apple account gets a notification by email immediately when a back-up starts downloading - whether or not two-factor authentication is enabled."" However, he added that he still had concerns about Apple's security system. ""The recovery key is hard to remember. And as far as you are not going to use it frequently - it is not needed at all while you have the trusted device handy - there is a good chance that you lose it,"" he said. ""And if you lose your device too, there will be no way to get your data back. ""Secondly, the recovery key might be stolen. And someone who managed to get your Apple ID password and your security key could make a lot of trouble for you, not just downloading your selfies."" But another security expert downplayed the risk of lost recovery keys, and said that Apple should do more than just recommend people switch on the two-factor test. ""We've seen so much in recent times that single-step verification - ie passwords - is vulnerable, we're at the stage that two-factor authentication should be the default,"" said Prof Alan Woodward, from the University of Surrey. ""It's a case of turn it on by default, and let people turn it off if they really don't want it. ""And that applies to not just Apple, but companies like Microsoft and Google too."" Apple has told the Wall Street Journal that it ""plans to more aggressively encourage people"" to turn two-factor authentication on and use stronger passwords. ""When I step back from this terrible scenario that happened and say what more could we have done, I think about the awareness piece,"" chief executive Tim Cook told the newspaper. ""I think we have a responsibility to ratchet that up. That's not really an engineering thing.""","Apple has expanded its use of ""two-step verification"" checks to protect data stored online by its customers."
"Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent@BBCRoryCJon Twitter The focus of their report is on BT's Openreach division and its alleged failure to invest in fast fibre. But there are others with questions to answer - notably the government, the regulator, and the broadband users. Because if, as the report says, ""the UK is not adequately investing in critical telecoms infrastructure"", and is ""a laggard by international standards in providing fibre connectivity"", that cannot be entirely BT's fault. The structure of our telecoms industry and the direction of our broadband strategy are, to a large extent, determined by the regulator Ofcom and by government ministers. Over the last decade, you could sum up their policy with those old retailers' maxims ""pile it high, sell it cheap"" or maybe ""never mind the quality, feel the width"". In other words, they have determined - perhaps rightly - that we as consumers want to get hold of broadband as quickly as we can but pay as little as possible. The intensely competitive landscape here and Ofcom's pressure on prices are presumably why the UK scores well compared with other EU countries when it comes to geographic coverage, take-up and lower prices. Where we score badly is in providing the most expensive but future-proof connection, FTTP, fibre to the premises. BT is now beginning to ramp up investment in FTTP, as are rivals like TalkTalk and Sky, but the UK has a lot of catching up to do. Five years ago just about all the big players in the industry seemed convinced that nobody would want or pay for such a luxury service, so they were not going to waste money in a competitive environment. Perhaps the regulator should have been more focused on the long term, rather than promoting competition. Competition was not the priority though in handing out the cash to reach rural Britain under the BDUK programme. Instead, it seemed to be speed and convenience that drove the decision to hand out all that money to BT. While the rollout has proceeded mostly on schedule, there are real concerns about a strategy which has seen the easier areas served first and information withheld from community schemes, making it difficult for them to know where to invest. But the biggest failure in broadband strategy is surely what has happened to small businesses. They have been told by the government that fast broadband connections are vital to their future and to Britain's economic wellbeing. But ""the present system is unacceptable"", says the report, describing a situation where small businesses are given a choice of a ridiculously expensive leased line or waiting for months or years until BT decides to hook up their business park. Yes, blame BT - but the MPs say it is being ""perversely disincentivised"" to put more effort into rolling out fibre to business parks, and that must be a failure of regulation. There is also a revealing exchange between the committee and the former digital minister Ed Vaizey about a voucher scheme designed to help small firms get better broadband. The scheme had been such a hit that the funds soon ran out, and it was halted last year. The minister told the committee that he would like to revive it ""but this was unlikely to be supported by the Treasury"". Perhaps the new government's commitment to improving Britain's infrastructure will mean the new Digital Minister Matt Hancock has better luck with the Treasury. The argument over whether BT should be split up will continue, probably for years. But in the meantime, we all need to decide what Britain's broadband infrastructure should look like - cheap and cheerful, or fast and future-proof.","The MPs on the Culture, Media and Sport committee are clear - our UK broadband strategy is going down the wrong path and BT must shoulder much of the blame."
"By Dave LeeTechnology reporter, BBC News ""I remember it like it was yesterday, son. I was in the queue at the butchers, checking Facebook on my phone, and there it was… history in the making."" It may not be most people's perfect idea of sporting theatre - but when fans look back on the coming weeks, one thing many will remember is how London 2012 was the first 'social media' games. Just look at the numbers. Four years ago, during the Beijing Games, there were just 100 million people on Facebook. Now, the network has rocketed past 900 million. On Twitter, a similar story - six million users were on the service in 2008. Now, over 600 million have signed up. Among them, many brilliant athletes, including some sporting veterans. ""I've been on it for just a couple of weeks now,"" said Sir Clive Woodward, director of sport for TeamGB, about his new Twitter account . ""I use it to publicise things - it gets out immediately, you don't have to wait until tomorrow's newspapers."" At the last count, according to the IOC, there were 2,014 verified Olympians, both past and present, using social networks - all poised to offer their views and reactions. Sporting heroes So where will they all be? On Facebook, a specially created Olympics portal has been launched. This includes timeline profiles of some of the biggest stars. You can, for example, follow diver Tom Daley's life and career from the present day back to his birth. ""The investment of communicating their story stays with them forever,"" said Joanna Shields, Facebook's boss for Europe. On Twitter , official accounts for London 2012, the International Olympic Committee (IOC), individual sports and athletes will keep supporters up to date. ""Never before have fans had such direct access to their sporting heroes,"" said Lewis Wiltshire, head of sport for Twitter UK. ""Athletes on Twitter answer questions, respond to 'good luck' wishes, talk to fellow stars, and share behind-the-scenes perspectives that people otherwise wouldn't have access to."" The most comprehensive effort comes via the IOC itself in the form of its Olympic Athletes' Hub . It offers a searchable directory of every verified Olympian on social media. Profile pages collate their activity across various networks, meaning every update - be it on Facebook, Twitter, or, soon, Google Plus - can be tracked in one place. When fans interact with sports stars through the site they can receive bonus content, such as an instructional rowing video from Matthew Pinsent. The IOC is also active on Instagram, Foursquare and Tumblr. Out of line But allowing athletes to express themselves to such a large audience may not always be a good thing. ""It's not a perfect world,"" admits Sir Clive. ""TeamGB is over a thousand people. It's not only athletes, you've got coaches and support staff. The chances of somebody saying something that's a bit out of line is probably pretty high. ""But we're trying our best to educate. That's all you can do - you can either shut the door and pretend it's not there and keep your fingers crossed, or you can really go down the education route."" TeamGB has produced an instructional video for athletes - fronted by Dame Kelly Holmes - warning about the risks ""loose"" tweeting could have on their reputations. ""One of my favourite sayings when speaking to athletes is 'how do you want to be remembered?'"" Sir Clive added. ""They're role models 24-7, and they're role models when they're on Twitter."" Athletes will also need to be mindful of strict guidelines from the IOC about what they can and can't post - particularly when it comes to videos and images from within Olympic venues. Raw emotion Momentary lapses in common sense aside, social media is set to allow an unprecedented glimpse into the highs and lows of being Olympian. One athlete who has charted a full range of emotions on the service is British sprinter Jeanette Kwakye. Her Olympic dream was shattered by an Achilles injury. It was a personal journey shared by her many Twitter followers. ""My timeline was full of my teammates who had made the team,"" she remembered. ""I put a statement out there saying 'this is exactly how I feel'. It was very raw, it was very up to the minute, it just gave people an insight to see there were two sides of the story. With the opening ceremony just over a week away, Ms Kwakye said she would use social networks to get behind the athletes - and she urged other TeamGB fans to do the same. ""Although some athletes will opt not to tweet during the games, I'm sure a lot of them will be reading tweets that come their way. So it will be so nice to get a hashtag culture of support."" At Facebook, a different, altogether cheekier hope - the possibility that athletes will turn to the network to get to know each other and even end up changing their relationship status. ""That would certainly make it really interesting!"" Facebook's Ms Shields said. ""Wouldn't that be cool? I don't know... I think their coaches would probably say 'behave yourself'.""","""Dad, where were you when Jess Ennis won gold at London 2012?"""
"By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor The sequel was released in November 1989. And watching it back nearly 26 years later, it's impressive to note how many tech trends it predicted, even if it also contained its fair share of misfires. Getting around ""Where we're going, we don't need roads..."" - well, that's one promise that didn't work out. Flying cars have always seemed to be just over the horizon. Boston-based Terrafugia, for example, promised to start selling a model in 2012, but is still trying to get its business off the ground. But while BTTF was overly optimistic about vertical take-offs becoming the norm, it did nail one detail. Listen to the sound effects used for its automobiles as they pass, and you hear the near-silent hum that's become associated with Toyota's Prius and other electric-powered four-wheelers. Throwing your rubbish into a car's Mr Fusion energy converter to provide it with power remains fanciful. But there have been moves towards powering vehicles with waste. Bristol and Bath recently started running buses powered by treated thrown-away food and sewage, and there are efforts elsewhere to convert agricultural waste into a petrol supplement. Furthermore, Biff's payment of his taxi ride with a thumb-print isn't totally dissimilar to how we now hail cars and cashlessly pay for them using Uber, Hailo, Lyft and innumerable other pick-up services. Even the film's iconic hoverboard chase scene is no longer totally outlandish. Lexus showed off a working hoverboard of its own in August, albeit one that relied on a hidden metal track being buried into the ground. More recently, skateboarder Tony Hawk was filmed trying out a rival version, called Hendo, based on similar magnet-based technology. (The less said about non-hovering hoverboards the better.) Barcode registration plates, however, have made little progress beyond the odd April fool. Looking good The tech world's current fascination with wearable tech was foreshadowed by Marty's talking jacket. And while today's clothes can't yet blow-dry us when we get wet, some fashion pioneers are experimenting with weaving electronics into their fabrics. So, BTTF's message-flashing police hats have a parallel in CuteCircuit's tweet-displaying dresses, and Nike has even filed a patent for self-lacing shoes similar to those featured in the film. When it comes to our own bodily care, we can't yet exfoliate away the years with a Doc-style ""rejuvenation clinic"" facial. But the 6.7 million botox injections and 1.2 million chemical peels carried out in the US last year suggest many are at least trying. Rise of the robots BTTF's drones may only make fleeting appearances, but feel very ""of the moment"". Media organisations, including the BBC, have started deploying camera-enabled aircraft to get new perspectives on the news - even if they might not be comfortable sending them into the kind of crowded situation USA Today's model films in the movie. Dog-walking drones are also a real thing - at least if you believe everything you see on Vimeo and YouTube. Another type of robot featured in the film is a mechanical car fuel attendant. The Netherlands has already tested such a device a few years back, with the TankPitstop project, and Tesla is developing something similar for its electric vehicles. Entertainment We've, thankfully, been spared Holomax sequels to Jaws. But the film industry hasn't given up on the idea of 3D technologies - its latest pitch is a laser-projection system said to deliver ""brighter, crisper and clearer"" images. Rather neatly, the innovation premiered in London earlier this month with Robert Zemeckis' latest film The Walk - he is, of course, also the director of the BTTF trilogy. Back to the Future II was closer to the mark when it came to home entertainment. A roll-up flatscreen shown in the McFlys' home is reminiscent of the flexible panels LG recently showed off at trade shows, which are rumoured to be featuring in commercial products soon. Meanwhile, voice-controlled televisions are already a reality thanks to smart TVs from Samsung and Sony as well as set-top boxes from Amazon and Apple. Smartglasses but no smartphones... We get little hint at what Marty Jr sees via his hi-tech specs in the film, and their brand, JVC, is a much smaller force in consumer electronics than it once was. But several of today's bigger names are betting on various forms of the tech, whether it's Microsoft's Hololens, Facebook's Oculus Rift virtual reality headset or version two of Google Glass. The film's biggest miss, however, is arguably its lack of a smartphone. Marty Jr is even seen using an AT&T payphone at one point - all the more ironic since the company was first to offer the iPhone. It's not that BTTF's filmmakers didn't envision a data-connected world - a Skype-like video chat program features at one point showing off not only the caller but also private details about them - but repeatedly communication occurs via a TV rather than a handheld display. Likewise, it's hard not to feel the film missed a trick by using a newspaper to warn of Marty Jr's impending arrest, instead of a touchscreen. Stanley Kubrick's 2001 - released two decades earlier - had already featured its own ""newspads"". And a campaigner trying to restore Hill Valley's clock tower even seems to be using a tablet in one of Back to the Future II's other scenes. An offline future It's hard to be too critical, however, when you consider that the World Wide Web was only invented the same year that the film was released, and Tim Berners-Lee did not create its first browser until the following year. That might explain why CD-Roms and their larger counterparts Laser Discs feature so prominently in piles of rubbish. Similarly, in an age before email even got its name, it's perhaps not surprising that the film's futurists imagined we would want to fax from the pavement. But even that does not quite explain why the McFlys' home has quite so many fax machines. Other hits and misses Computer-controlled ovens are still a relative rarity - although a robotic chef was indeed one of the highlights of a recent start-up showcase in San Francisco. Sadly, pizza hydrators are still the stuff of pepperoni-fuelled dreams - and selfie-taking fridges have proved to be scant compensation. BTTF does score a hit with computer-controlled door locks - Yale was the latest to release such a product earlier this month. But the idea of an Ortho-lev machine holding George McFly upside down seems like a rush of blood to the writers' heads - until you realise it was only included in the movie to disguise the fact that a different actor was portraying the character than in the first film.",It's Back to the Future Day - the date Marty and Doc crashed the future in the second of the three time-hopping sci-fi adventure films.
"The iPhone users argued that there is no alternative place to buy an iPhone app, but that Apple takes a 30% commission on every sale, so therefore they are being overcharged. They claim that this puts Apple in breach of anti-trust laws. Apple said that it was an agent for app developers and that it neither owned nor sold the apps itself. However, while app developers set their own prices, Apple collects the payments. One of the judges who ruled against Apple was President Donald Trump's controversial appointment, Brett Kavanaugh. ""Leaving consumers at the mercy of monopolistic retailers, simply because upstream suppliers could also sue the retailers, would directly contradict the long-standing goal of effective private enforcement in anti-trust cases,"" he said. The suit, filed by leading plaintiff Robert Pepper, dates back to 2011. According to statistics portal Statista, US customers spent $46.6bn (£36bn) on a combination of in-app purchases, subscription and premium apps in 2018.",A group of US consumers has been given the go-ahead by the Supreme Court to sue Apple over app prices.
"The thieves hijacked the website of finance security start-up Enigma and posted messages saying it was about to launch its own currency. Many people keen to cash in transferred ethereum to the thieves' account. In response, Enigma shut down its website and adopted stronger security policies to keep hackers out. In a statement posted to its Twitter account, Enigma said the thieves had carried out the scam after taking over the company's web domain, mailing lists and Slack messaging service account. By posting a message on the Enigma website and sending notices out via Slack and email, the malicious hackers convinced many people the security company was seeking early investors. The attackers played on the fact that early next month Enigma plans to run a crypto-cash-based fundraising exercise to bankroll its expansion. The criminal hackers asked for investments to be paid in ethereum and are believed to have amassed about $500,000 worth before the scam was spotted and shut down. Enigma said none of its infrastructure had been used for the scam and none of its funds had been stolen by the attackers. It said it had now regained control of its compromised accounts. It has also adopted stronger security measures internally to prevent hijacks. Enigma has also stopped using Slack and moved to the secure messaging program Telegram. ""We've moved up a number of critical security steps and taken additional measures to protect the community going forward,"" Tor Bair, a spokesman for Enigma, told Wired. ""We're now very well aware of the potential threats and are taking no chances."" Enigma added it was helping to investigate the scam and who was behind it with the help of other crypto-cash and security companies.","Cyber-thieves are believed to have stolen about $500,000 (£390,000) in the Ethereum crypto-currency, with an investment scam."
"The arrangement was revealed in papers filed to a California court by both companies on Thursday. The dispute began in 2011 when Apple said Samsung was using some of its patented technologies without permission. The payment does not mean the end of the row as, next year, a US court will decide if Apple deserves more damages. Patent exam A joint case management statement filed to the California court revealed that Samsung had agreed to pay Apple within 10 days of receiving an invoice. The payment is part of a bigger $1bn damages award that Apple was granted in 2012 by a jury that considered the case. That total was reduced on appeal to $930m. Further legal action split this total into two parts - a $548m chunk for technology patents and a $382m chunk for allegations that Samsung copied Apple's packaging materials. A jury is due to decide on the second damages award in 2016. Despite agreeing to pay the first part of the settlement, Samsung said it reserved the right to get its money back if there were further developments in the case. The US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) is currently reviewing some of the patents Apple used in the court case. In a statement, Samsung said: ""While we've agreed to pay Apple, we remain confident that our products do not infringe on Apple's design patents, and we will continue to take all appropriate measures within the legal system to protect our products and our intellectual property."" Apple has disputed Samsung's right to a refund if the patents are ruled invalid. One of the patents in the case, covering ways to add the ""pinch to zoom"" feature to smartphones, has already been ruled invalid by the USPTO. Apple is appealing against this decision. Soon after the USPTO made the decision to invalidate the pinch patent, Samsung lodged a call to review the entire case with the US appeals court. This call was rejected. ""After years of not getting a cent, more than half a billion dollars is significant,"" wrote patent expert Florian Mueller in a blogpost. However, he added, the continuing uncertainty about the validity of some Apple patents and Samsung's plans to file fresh appeals meant the case was a long way from reaching resolution.",Samsung has agreed to pay Apple $548m (£362m) as part of a deal to settle a long-running patent dispute.
"Dave LeeNorth America technology reporter In short, it involves “pivoting” - as they say - to a more private social network. One which focuses on closed spaces, like groups or messaging, rather than the public News Feed. He unveiled this plan in March, a year after the Cambridge Analytica scandal hit. At the time, I noted that critics were concerned that the shift would mean Facebook was abdicating some of its responsibilities. Making Facebook more private would arguably not remove the problems of abuse - though it would make it harder for outsiders to find instances of Facebook’s failures. Recent stories have demonstrated that concern was perhaps justified. On Monday, ProPublica revealed the existence of a private Facebook group which contained disturbing jokes allegedly posted by US Border Patrol agents. The investigative site said comments included mockery of migrants that had died in custody, as well as aggressive, sexist remarks about prominent female politicians. The group has existed for more three years and has almost 10,000 members. A Facebook spokesperson told the BBC: ""We want everyone using Facebook to feel safe. Our community standards apply across Facebook, including in secret groups. We're co-operating with federal authorities in their investigation."" Separately, a report last month from California-based investigative group Reveal exposed groups where police officers, from more than 50 different departments across the country, shared racist memes, islamophobia and conspiracy theories. And the Washington Post detailed a flurry of groups offering bogus cancer treatment “advice”, such as to ""use baking soda or frankincense” instead of chemotherapy. These groups are able and allowed to flourish - the Post reported at least two with more than 100,000 members. Facebook said it provides related news stories to posts that might contain misinformation, but we don’t have any statistics on how effective this measure is. (Facebook has, however, banned some women who had shared mastectomy scars as an act of solidarity and encouragement with others facing their own battle with cancer.) Hidden from view What makes these examples of abuse more significant than what we’ve seen in the past? They show how Facebook’s strategy has the ability to push its problems into the shadows. ProPublica was only able to observe the Border Patrol group thanks to someone sending them screenshots - otherwise it was entirely hidden from view. Reveal had to use specially-written software code that cross-referenced members of hate groups against users who were signed up to legitimate pages about police work. The Washington Post reporter was able to access some groups, but was swiftly banned and blocked when it became clear who she was. Even Facebook finds it more difficult to find itself accountable when it comes to groups. The site has said its ability to use algorithms and AI to detect hate speech and misinformation still falls short, and therefore it still relies heavily on users reporting inappropriate content. In groups, this of course becomes far less likely: the inappropriate content is the reason people joined the group in the first place. And Facebook has shown limited willingness to proactively look for these kind of abuses itself. Groups have, of course, been a feature on Facebook since the early days. But never before have they had such prominence. Facebook, as directed by its leader, is aggressively pushing users to use groups more often. There’s an advertising campaign - which includes hand-painted murals - and a new button placed front and centre in its mobile app. Private is the new public. “This vision could backfire terribly,” warned French journalism professor, Frederick Pilloux, in 2018. “An increase in the weight of 'groups' means reinforcement of Facebook’s worst features - cognitive bubbles - where users are kept in silos fueled by a torrent of fake news and extremism.” Make no mistake: few, if any, of the problems Facebook is “working hard” on at the moment would have come to light were it not for external pressure from journalists, lawmakers, academics and civil rights groups. The examples I’ve raised here pose a question: is Facebook fixing itself, or merely making it harder for us to see it's broken? _______ Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC Do you have more information about this or any other technology story?

"By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter So began a sequence of events that saw Ibrahim Diallo fired from his job, not by his manager but by a machine. He has detailed his story in a blogpost which he hopes will serve as a warning to firms about relying too much on automation. ""Automation can be an asset to a company, but there needs to be a way for humans to take over if the machine makes a mistake,"" he writes. The story of Mr Diallo's sacking by machine began when his entry pass to the Los Angeles skyscraper where his office was based failed to work, forcing him to rely on the security guard to allow him entry. ""As soon as I got to my floor, I went to see my manager to let her know. She promised to order me a new one right away."" Then he noticed that he was logged out of his work system and a colleague told Mr Diallo that the word ""Inactive"" was listed alongside his name. His day got worse. After lunch - and a 10-minute wait for a co-worker to let him back into his office - he was told by his recruiter that she had received an email saying his contract was terminated. She promised to sort out the problem. The next day he had been locked out of every single system ""except my Linux machine"" and then, after lunch, two people appeared at his desk. Mr Diallo was told that an email had been received telling them to escort him from the building. His boss was confused but helpless as Mr Diallo recalls: ""I was fired. There was nothing my manager could do about it. There was nothing the director could do about it. They stood powerless as I packed my stuff and left the building."" At the time, he was eight months into a three-year contract and over the next three weeks he was copied into emails about his case. ""I watched it be escalated to bigger and more powerful titles over and over, yet no-one could do anything about it. From time-to-time, they would attach a system email. ""It was soulless and written in red as it gave orders that dictated my fate. Disable this, disable that, revoke access here, revoke access there, escort out of premises, etc. ""The system was out for blood and I was its very first victim."" It took Mr Diallo's bosses three weeks to find out why he had been sacked. His firm was going through changes, both in terms of the systems it used and the people it employed. His original manager had been recently laid off and sent to work from home for the rest of his time at the firm and in that period he had not renewed Mr Diallo's contract in the new system. After that, machines took over - flagging him as an ex-employee. ""All the necessary orders are sent automatically and each order completion triggers another order. For example, when the order for disabling my key card is sent, there is no way of it to be re-enabled. ""Once it is disabled, an email is sent to security about recently dismissed employees. Scanning the key card is a red flag. The order to disable my Windows account is also sent. There is also one for my Jira account. And on and on."" Although Mr Diallo was allowed back to work, he had missed out on three weeks' worth of pay and been escorted from the building ""like a thief"". He had to explain his disappearance to others and found his co-workers became distant. He decided to move to another job. His story should serve as a cautionary tale about the human-machine relationship, thinks AI expert Dave Coplin. ""It's another example of a failure of human thinking where they allow it to be humans versus machines rather than humans plus machines,"" he said. ""One of the fundamental skills for all humans in an AI world is accountability - just because the algorithm says it's the answer, it doesn't mean it actually is.""","""It wasn't the first time my key card failed, I assumed it was time to replace it."""
"It said the machine would be the ""smallest Xbox ever"". The firm's UK, US and French Twitter accounts are among those to have subsequently confirmed local launch dates of 10 November. Company watchers have said the advertised price is significantly lower than had been expected. Microsoft has said the machine is set to cost £250/$299/€249. It is £50 more than the lowest-priced version of the firm's existing Xbox One range. The company has yet to give a launch date or price for the larger and presumably more powerful Xbox Series X. Beyond a photo that appears to show a large air vent on the Xbox S's side, Microsoft has yet to reveal how exactly the console will differ from its larger sibling. But there has been speculation it will: The move might help Microsoft woo consumers who might otherwise wait for the price of the Xbox Series X and Sony's PlayStation 5 machines to fall before deciding which platform to adopt. ""The Xbox Series S in my view, represents a great value compromise in a world of ever-increasing costs for cutting-edge technology,"" commented Adam Campbell, founder of POC in Play, an organisation that promotes people of colour working in the gaming industry. ""It could be a real winner for the average gamer and an advantage against Xbox’s main rival."" Sony has previously said it plans to sell a version of the PlayStation 5 without a disc drive but has yet to say how much it will cost. Microsoft already offers an ""all digital"" version of its current console. Although the firms sell them for a lower cost than those with built-in disc drives, they can quickly make up the shortfall because owners are dependent on their online stores, from which they take a cut. Microsoft's announcement comes days before the launch of a service that will let subscribers play top-end Xbox games on Android smartphones. However, xCloud's subscription cost and the fact that Apple has not allowed it to work on iPhones could be stumbling blocks for the experiment.",Microsoft has confirmed that it will release a second next-generation console after a leak prompted it to unveil the Xbox Series S.
"The deleted links include pages about European criminals, a musician and an amateur chess player. The Wikimedia Foundation, which operates the site, said the internet was being ""riddled with memory holes"" as a result of such takedowns. The action follow a European Court of Justice ruling in May. The judges involved decided that citizens had the right to have links to ""irrelevant"" and outdated data erased from search engine results. A fortnight ago Google briefed data regulators that it had subsequently received more than 91,000 requests covering a total of 328,000 links that applicants wanted taken down, and had approved more than 50% of those processed. The search engine is critical of the court's decision, but has set up a page that people can use to request removals. At a press conference in London, the Wikimedia Foundation revealed that Google had notified it of five requests involving Wikipedia that it had acted on, affecting more than 50 links to its site. A dedicated page on Wikipedia states that they include: ""We only know about these removals because the involved search engine company chose to send notices to the Wikimedia Foundation,"" the organisation's lawyers wrote in a blog. ""Search engines have no legal obligation to send such notices. Indeed, their ability to continue to do so may be in jeopardy. ""Since search engines are not required to provide affected sites with notice, other search engines may have removed additional links from their results without our knowledge. This lack of transparent policies and procedures is only one of the many flaws in the European decision."" EU regulators have expressed concern that Google is notifying website administrators of the links it removes, suggesting this undermines the point of the law. While the links do not appear on Google.co.uk and other versions of the search engine created for specific EU countries, they do still appear on Google.com, which can be accessed in Europe. Data requests The Wikimedia Foundation has also published its first transparency report - following a similar practice by Google, Twitter and others. It reveals that the organisation received 304 general content removal requests between July 2012 and June 2014, none of which it complied with. They included a takedown request from a photographer who had claimed he owned the copyright to a series of selfies taken by a monkey. Gloucestershire-based David Slater had rotated and cropped the images featured on the site. But the foundation rejected his claim on the grounds that the monkey had taken the photo, and was therefore the real copyright owner. The foundation also revealed it had received 56 requests for data about its users. It said it had complied with eight of these requests, affecting 11 accounts. All of these resulted in information being passed to US-based bodies. ""If we must produce information due to a legally valid request, we will notify the affected user before we disclose, if we are legally permitted and have the means to do so,"" the foundation said. ""In certain cases, we may help find assistance for users to fight an invalid request.""","Wikipedia has begun naming links to its online encyclopaedia that have been removed from EU search results under ""right to be forgotten"" rules."
"By Dougal ShawBBC News If all the videos you took of your children growing up were damaged and you could keep only the pictures or the sound, which would it be? I liked to tantalise myself with this question before I had children, and I imagined surprising people by saying that - despite being a video journalist - I would choose the sound. There is something more evocative about it, particularly the voice. To hear again a deceased relative, for example, is more arresting to me than to see a picture or silent video. However, what I've actually found since becoming a parent is that there is another way of recording the fleeting moments of childhood, the results of which are more precious to me than either video or sound. My preferred method still involves the smartphone, but it is focused on the power of words. To explain the inspiration behind my method I need to recall my own childhood. When I was around 10 or 11 years old, I became intrigued by a book I found on my parents' bookshelf. It was called Conversations with Children, an anthology of transcripts made by a child psychologist called R D Laing, who recorded what his children had said. It was full of all the wonderful, crazy, uninhibited ideas you might expect. It was both entertaining and thought-provoking because Laing took the chance to explain the common patterns of emotional and intellectual development experts find in children. He explained how during childhood we gradually come to understand concepts that determine our place in the world and what is possible within it: size, geography, time, empathy, ownership, societal norms, death. I determined that when I had children I would record something similar myself. In 2009 I acquired my first child and Steve Jobs's third iPhone. So I was part of the first generation of parents to have easy access to a stills camera, video recorder, audio recorder and digital notepad all in one handy device. The early iPhones, having a fairly low resolution, didn't capture video very well. But in any case, when my daughter started to speak her first words, I found that I had a strong impulse to write down what she said rather than film her - remembering Laing's inspirational book. To begin with, I wrote her early words in an ornate, hardback book that I bought specially for the purpose, befitting the words' importance, I thought. But this presented problems. I soon became worried about losing it. And it took time to find it when there was something to write down, meaning I might forget what had been said in the meantime. I found it more convenient to write down the words in the Notes app of my iPhone, which I could always whip out of my pocket. Once a month or so I could email the notes so I had a back-up copy. Later, cloud computing would help. I had never in my life kept a diary, but suddenly it felt vital to record the experiences unfolding around me as accurately as possible. Some pitfalls immediately became apparent on appointing myself the family's digital scribe and archivist. My fumbling on the phone was sometimes misconstrued as untimely and indulgent internet surfing - an injustice when I was actually engaged in the noble task of recording events for posterity. You have to disengage temporarily from family life to make a decent stab of recording it accurately. Of course I wanted to keep as accurate a record as possible. But can words, recalled by a human, be as reliable as recorded video or sound? One thing I've found from hours spent filming and recording audio at work as a BBC News video features journalist is that the most poignant moments are very difficult to capture. You are lucky to have the mechanical equipment on and recording during that telling event that unfolded so quickly around you. But by using that capturing device that is always on but invisible, known as our memory, any event, any candid, revelatory moment that unfolded suddenly out of the mundane, can be recorded and cherished. The trade-off is you lose the 100% mechanical guarantee of accuracy. There have been times when something wonderful was said so perfectly by my children, that I was determined to write down their precise words at the first opportunity. But inevitably I would be confounded by a thousand preoccupations that looking after children throws your way, resulting in the mental agony that I couldn't guarantee to myself that I'd recorded the words correctly. Longer, drawn-out conversations, of course - like an argument between two siblings over who has the larger spoon at breakfast - can't, unfortunately, be recorded verbatim. Unnatural reactions Another issue I've encountered at work is the reaction of humans to being recorded. As soon as the red light is on and the subject is invited to speak, everybody to some extent acts unnaturally, from the member of the public (nervous) to the media-trained professional (too polished, verbose and over-confident). The most revealing comments - even when a story is completely uncontroversial - are made off-camera, when a person is relaxed and has forgotten the recording device is there. This doesn't matter for the uninhibited toddler. But certainly from around five years old, a child has developed enough self-consciousness and a sense of identity to change behaviour when they realise they are being filmed for others and for posterity. You can tell this from the way they now produce a staged smile for a photograph. This phase of child development is recorded in my own notes. I begin to find references, from around the age of five, to the whole note-recording process, including requests for things to be written down because the subjects themselves realise what they have said is funny or otherwise noteworthy. Occasionally there is an objection to the whole enterprise, for being embarrassing or boring. Of course I'm sure I'm not the first parent to have written down the choice words their children have spoken. But I am one of the new generation to benefit from having the smartphone to aid the enterprise. In an age when parents are obsessively filming, photographing and sharing to social media, I think it's worth remembering the power of this simpler, in some ways more intimate, method. It's something I came to appreciate even more as I witnessed my children learning to read and write themselves: the joy of being absorbed in a book you are devouring, the creative possibilities opened up by writing. Both are so much more fulfilling than passively consuming an endless stream of games and videos on a mobile device. Future-proof Recording childhood through a digital record of words also carries some practical benefits. It avoids the nightmare of trying to sync videos from your phone and then organise and archive them in a safe place. And it is also more future-proof, because you have to wonder whether, in decades' time, the video file formats you used will still be readable. Today my children are nine and seven years old. The endearing, hilarious, uninhibited, sweet, surreal words still flow - although now they are more of a manageable trickle. My book stands at 135 pages long. When I look back on the notes, the power of these words is already greater than I could have imagined when I started the project. To reread them stirs memories, recalling sights and sounds from the moment they were spoken, in a very vivid way. Perhaps one day when I am frail in a care home this most precious book can be read to me. Perhaps by my own children, if they visit. And they will know that I was there and I heard every word. And that I cared enough to record it.

"Germany's justice minister has drafted a law that seeks to impose the fines as part of efforts to police toxic chat. Heiko Maas said the voluntary efforts of social networks to tackle the problem had not gone far enough. The proposal requires sites to run 24-hour helplines and to delete flagged content within seven days. 'Utterly impossible' Social media firms such as Twitter and Facebook were getting better at handling illegal content, said Mr Maas, but both had a long way to go. Mr Maas quoted research which suggested Twitter deletes only 1% of the hate speech it is told about by users, and Facebook, 39%. ""This isn't sufficient yet,"" said Mr Maas. Racism and hate speech are believed to have become more prevalent on German social media following the arrival of large number of refugees in Germany. Any content that was ""clearly criminal"" would have to be removed within 24 hours under conditions outlined in the draft law. If, after an investigation, content is found to be criminal then that must be removed in seven days. The people who posted the illegal content must also be told about its deletion. The proposed law would require each network to run fully staffed, round-the-clock reporting systems and to name an individual responsible for handling complaints. That person could face an individually levied fine of five million euros if companies break laws governing what can be published. Mr Maas said the law could apply to fake news articles if they proved to be slanderous, defamatory or libellous. Facebook did not comment directly on the proposal but said tests it commissioned showed it removed a higher percentage of illegal content than Mr Maas claimed. The social network said it expected to have 700 people employed in Berlin by the end of 2017 overseeing its efforts to review flagged content. German digital trade association Bitkom criticised the proposed law. It told the Financial Times that the requirement to remove material within 24 hours on sites that handle more than one billion posts per day was ""utterly impossible to implement in operational terms"".",Social media firms in Germany could face fines of up to 50 million euros if they take too long to remove illegal content including fake news.
"The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), which tracks abuse sites, is passing data to start-up Elliptic, which helps Bitcoin exchanges monitor transactions. The data comes from transactions carried out on sites the IWF monitors The IWF said the ""pseudo-anonymity"" offered by bitcoins made them an increasingly popular form of payment. Money web ""We are seeing it being used on the more dedicated commercial abuse sites that we monitor on a regular basis,"" said Sarah Smith, IWF's technical researcher. Ms Smith said the IWF had first noticed the virtual currency being used in 2014 alongside other payment systems, but its use on abuse sites was growing alongside other illicit use of the virtual cash. Bitcoins' ""pseudo-anonymity"" made it a very attractive payment system in criminal circles, she added. The IWF's work to disrupt abuse sites had left it with a list of Bitcoin addresses associated with sites selling abuse content and their customers, said Ms Smith. This list and any other addresses the IWF finds are being passed to tech company Elliptic to help in its work to curb criminal use of bitcoins. ""This is the first time anybody has started identifying these crimes in Bitcoin and flagging them up in a system like ours,"" said James Smith, head of Elliptic, adding that it was a ""great step"" towards eliminating illicit use of bitcoins. Elliptic analyses the Bitcoin blockchain - the virtual currency's central ledger in which every deal done with the digital cash is recorded - to spot stolen coins, to trace transactions that seek to hide their criminal origins or to conceal the illegal uses to which they are put. It passes information about the web of dodgy transactions to exchanges and other merchants to help them avoid doing business with ""known bad actors"" and to stop them being inadvertently enrolled in money-laundering schemes.",Bitcoins used to buy images of child sex abuse could soon be tracked and blocked as two companies share data on how the virtual currency is spent.
"By Mark WardTechnology correspondent, BBC News How did the attackers get their code into those apps? By being really sneaky. Instead of targeting individual apps, whoever created the malicious code implanted it in a version of the software tools used to make apps for Apple tablets and phones - a toolset called Xcode. Many developers, and big companies, apparently used the booby-trapped version because it downloaded quicker in China than the official version from Apple. Is it just a problem in China? No, but the vast majority of the apps found to be harbouring the malicious code are made wholly for China or are versions customised for the region. However, further analysis is revealing that a few used widely outside China are also affected. The list is growing all the time and so far about 50 apps are known to be vulnerable. What does the nasty code do? It can grab the unique identification numbers on a phone or tablet and get at other information about that device and who is using it. The malware also lets its creator communicate with a compromised phone to send fake alerts, hijack web links or read data. So far, there are no reports of attacks exploiting the booby-trapped code in the wild. What should I do if I am at risk? Stay calm. Check the list to see if you are using a vulnerable version, If so, uninstall it. Check the website of that app maker and look for information about how to get a safe version. Be on the lookout for unsolicited alerts or if web browsing via an Apple device is redirected. It also might be worth resetting iCloud and other passwords set up or used via your tablet or phone. Do this on a separate computer and not on a potentially vulnerable device. Some security firms are warning that if one group or person has managed to subvert Apple tools, others might be able to do the same. More App sTore malware might be on the way. Who was behind this attack? We don't know. We do know that mobile malware makers are very active in China because there have been a lot of attacks on jailbroken phones. It is the world's biggest market for smartphones which means lots of potential victims. But this attack bucks the trends in mobile crime for several reasons. Firstly because of its scale. Millions of victims means an admin headache for any attacker keen to monetise the malware. While there are a lot of mobile attacks they tend to go for smaller groups that produce a manageable stream of data. Secondly, malware makers prefer to stay hidden. Ideally they want their malware to lurk on a handset for weeks or months so they can slowly siphon off small sums of cash, steadily steal saleable information or feed in ads. This attack has made a very big impact and got people looking for the malware it spawned. Thirdly, it looks like the booby-trapped version of Xcode has been posted to Github - a place where software developers share code so others can use it, update it or change it to suit their own ends. This is odd because malware makers do not tend to share their creations. Text alongside the shared code ""apologises for the problems brought upon everyone by the XcodeGhost incident"" leading some to question whether it was malicious or a mistake. Why do they do it? Money. Most phones are linked to a payment system so criminals are keen to find ways to tap into that stream of cash. This often means mobile attacks are aimed at people in the same nation as a criminal. The App Store is a tempting target for malware makers because, before now, Apple did a good job of securing it. Plus many Apple users have significant disposable income that attackers are keen to siphon off. There are persistent rumours that some security researchers have made huge sums by selling previously unknown iOS vulnerabilities to governments. What do we know about Chinese hackers? We know that malicious hackers are very active in China and, like any modern nation, it has a busy cybercrime economy. In addition, many crime groups outside the nation pipe their attacks through compromised machines in China to make it hard for law enforcement to trace them. China also has a large number of hacker groups that operate as proxies of the state. These carry out all kinds of attacks beyond China's borders. China has persistently denied any official involvement in these cyberassaults. However, the scale of the state apparatus that oversees the web in China makes many people sceptical that these groups could operate without tacit approval. The attack is embarrassing as it was discovered just before a diplomatic meeting involving the US and China at which hacking, industrial espionage and cybercrime are due to be discussed.","Malicious code has been found in dozens of popular apps in Apple's App Store exposing perhaps millions of people to data theft and phishing. The attack originated in China and, so far, it looks like the biggest number of victims are found there."
"In addition, networks will be forbidden from activating new ""fake"" devices bought after 1 October. Government officials said the move was designed to protect consumers from hazardous materials and to safeguard mobile payment systems. They added it should also help them track users and limit violence ahead of March's general election. The action had originally been scheduled to take place at the end of 2011, but was twice delayed to give subscribers a chance to replace their devices. However, the Ministry of Information and Communications has said this would not happen again. The government said three million users were using counterfeit handsets as of June. Official data suggests the country had 29 million mobile phone subscribers at the end of March. Duplicated codes The Communications Commission of Kenya (CCK) defines fake handsets as ""copies of popular brands and models made from sub-standard materials"" that have not been licensed by the organisation. They are sourced from China and other parts of Asia, as well as Nigeria and South Africa. The CCK said ""sub-standard components"" were often used which had not been put through safety checks and might emit higher than recommended radiation levels. They have proved popular since they are often sold at a heavy discounts to legitimate models, thanks in part to the fact that retailers avoid paying import taxes. But the commission said they had caused an increase of dropped calls for all users because of ""their inability to connect seamlessly to the mobile networks"". Law enforcement agencies had also complained that some of the devices used duplicated IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identifier) codes, making it difficult to track down users suspected of using their handsets to plan crimes. In addition, when the government publicised the switch-off in June it also linked the move to efforts to restrict fraud. ""In this era of mobile banking, use of counterfeit devices, which are manufactured without due consideration to the recognised security standards, may expose our mobile money systems as well as the wider banking and financial system to unnecessary risks,"" said the communications secretary Dr Bitange Ndemo. ""The government cannot allow this to happen and thus our decision to have all unregistered SIM cards and counterfeit handset mobile phones phased out by 30 September 2012."" Election violence The move was initially opposed by the Consumers Federation of Kenya, a campaign group which said the action would punish users who were not to blame for the fact fakes were sold. But last month the organisation dropped a theat to go to court to block the switch-off after a study suggested most Kenyans supported the effort. Sunday's deadline also means counterfeit models can be barred from networks ahead of the election on 4 March 2013. About 1,300 people were killed and hundreds of thousands forced from their homes because of clashes following 2007's disputed presidential election. There is concern the vote could spark further violence, and the CCK has suggested that ensuring all mobiles were registered could act as a deterrent. ""As the general elections draw near, we... have an obligation to ensure that the mobile telecoms industry is not used to perpetrate instability and to incite violence,"" said Francis Wangusi, the commission's director general. Precious metals Users can send a free SMS message containing their 15-number IMEI code to check that their handset is recognised as genuine. The fact millions of devices will need to be replaced presents phone manufacturers with an opportunity to boost sales. But there are also been worries that abandoned handsets could end up in landfill sites, damaging the environment. To minimise the risk Nokia and Samsung have partnered with a local recycling company and mobile service providers to allow users to safely dispose of counterfeit models at collection points in major cities. ""Mobile phones contain many valuable and useful materials that can be recycled, including precious metals and plastics,"" said Bruce Howe, general manager for Nokia East Africa. ""For every one million phones recycled, it is possible to recover nearly 35kg of gold and 350kg of silver, which can be re-used in the production of future electronic goods."" The firm added that it believed Kenya's move was a model that could be adopted elsewhere in Africa and beyond. Uganda has already said that it planned similar action.",Kenya has confirmed that a switch-off of counterfeit mobile phones will take place at the end of the month.
"""Olympic tickets"" came second in Google's annual zeitgeist report, which lists 2012's most searched-for terms. London was the most searched-for city in the UK, while Rio, host of the next Summer Olympics, was the most searched-for travel destination. Skyfall reflected its box-office success, as the top trending movie. Singer Whitney Houston, who died in February, was the most searched-for person, followed by ""Kate Middleton"", the Duchess of Cambridge. The people list looked very different on rival search engine Bing, which revealed its top 2012 searches a few weeks ago. Topping its global list was reality TV star Kim Kardashian, followed by singer Justin Bieber. Kim Kardashian also topped Yahoo's most searched-for list. Sprinter Usain Bolt was the most searched-for Olympian, according to Google, while the most searched-for British star of the Summer Games was tennis player Andy Murray, followed by diver Tom Daley and athlete Jessica Ennis. On Bing's list, Bolt only made it in at number nine, with tennis player Serena Williams, athlete Lolo Jones and basketball player LeBron James making its top three. Nostalgia trip Cyclist Victoria Pendleton was the most searched-for reality TV star, following her appearance on Strictly Come Dancing, while Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt beat London Mayor Boris Johnson to the top politician's spot, according to Google. Cbeebies show Mike the Knight beat US hit Homeland to the number one spot for TV shows, with another home-grown hit, the Great British Bake Off, also making the top 10. Some of the most interesting results are revealed in Google's more esoteric searches. Topping the ""what is"" poll was ""love"", followed by the far less romantic ""iCloud"" and ""3G"".

It added that the two most retweeted messages were President Obama's tweet of himself hugging his wife after winning the US vote, and a picture pop star Justin Bieber posted of himself with a fan to say goodbye after she died of brain cancer.","""The Olympics"" may have seemed like a safe bet for the top search term in the UK this year - but, according to Google, it was eclipsed by ""Euro 2012""."
"By Zoe KleinmanTechnology reporter, BBC News Despite a dazzling array of new devices on display at the recent Mobile World Congress in Barcelona: phones that fold, phones with buttons, phones with enormous batteries, expensive phones, budget phones, 5G-ready phones… they aren't exactly flying off the shelves. Samsung's overall operating profits were down by 60% year-on-year for the first quarter of 2019. Apple slashed its iPhone sales forecasts at the start of the year, blaming a slowdown, particularly in China. It has since repositioned itself to focus on services rather than gadgets, unveiling a new TV streaming platform, gaming portal and credit card at a star-studded event in March attended by Oprah Winfrey and the actor Reese Witherspoon - with not a new device in sight. Sales in China, the world's biggest phone market, were down 20% year-on-year in February 2019. That's their lowest in six years, according to figures released by the state-affiliated research unit China Academy of Information and Communications Technology. Sales had already been slowing in Europe, says Marina Koytcheva, technology markets analyst at CCS Insight, and elsewhere, with the possible exception of India and Africa. ""I don't think I have seen the market with such a negative outlook in the last 10 years,"" she says. ""I don't think we will ever again see the growth of five or 10 years ago."" There are several reasons why. Innovation (or lack of) The top-end handsets have increased in price dramatically in recent years. In 2017, Apple boldly smashed the $1,000 (£775) price point with the iPhone X, followed by Samsung with the Galaxy Note 8. ""In less than a year, the $1,000 phone has become entirely normal,"" noted Vlad Savov on tech website the Verge in August 2018. Critics of the phone industry argue that at the same time, innovation has stalled. Each new handset might have a slightly better camera, slightly faster processors than the last, but for the average consumer, one black rectangle is pretty much being replaced by another. In the last few weeks, both Huawei and Samsung have unveiled a new take on the black rectangle - the folding phone. The Huawei Mate X folds out into an 8in device. It has split screen abilities, no notch and is 5G ready. When it was unveiled, the audience gasped loudly at the 2,299 euros ($2,600; £1,996) price tag. For those with that cash to spend on a new phone, is it exciting enough to break the global ennui? ""There will be a small number of big enthusiasts who will buy these phones but they will have to fall in price quite a lot to make an impact,"" says Marina Koytcheva. ""They will have to start selling in large numbers."" That will only happen if the device can prove itself useful. ""It's impressive innovation,"" says Ms Koytcheva . ""But why do you need it?"" And here's another potential red flag: Samsung has now delayed the launch of its Galaxy Fold following reports of broken screens. Big screens, small pockets The traditionally male-dominated tech sector has been accused of ignoring at least 50% of its target market - women - in not acknowledging that women's hands and trouser pockets are generally smaller than men's while flooding the market with ever larger devices. When Apple announced it was discontinuing its iPhone SE, which has a 4in screen, Caroline Criado-Perez, author of a new book called Invisible Women, tweeted that the tech giant had ""failed to update the only phone it makes that fits the average woman's hand size"". ""Weak applause all round from my arthritic hands,"" she continued in the now-deleted thread on Twitter in September 2018. 5G future 5G - the next generation of mobile internet - could give phone sales the vital injection they need. Promises made for it include being able to download a 15-minute video in one second, potentially making home broadband redundant and getting all your smart gadgets properly connecting with each other. However, there are no 5G devices on the market yet. They are on their way - although global security concerns threaten to derail the rollout schedule. Chinese firm Huawei is one of the few manufacturers of the infrastructure required for 5G and there are concerns from several countries, led by the US, over whether it can be trusted. Mobile provider O2 said Huawei makes up only 5% of its UK 5G infrastructure, but it would take time and money to remove it all if the government orders it to do so. ""In October 2018, we expected 5G to have some positive effect on the market this year,"" says Marina Koytcheva. ""We thought it would support it, but 5G is coming more slowly than we hoped."" Phone freedom And finally - a growing number of people are choosing to step away from their phones altogether. Last year, France introduced strict rules around the use of smartphones in schools, banning them for all pupils under the age of 15. Apple, Google and Facebook also released tools that show you the extent of your screentime - a move which was greeted with amused horror, and some criticism. ""It's like locking an alcoholic in a booze cupboard and then helping them count how many bottles they've consumed,"" said Catherine Miller, director of policy at the think tank Doteveryone. The phone industry's response to this desire to detach has been to unleash so-called companion phones - smaller handsets with more basic functions, designed to keep people connected without keeping them hooked. Now whether the solution to you spending less time on your big phone involves you buying a smaller phone is perhaps debatable but it shows the industry is at least listening, having devoted years to producing devices specifically designed to maintain our interest. Marina Koytcheva thinks the smartphone market is ultimately stabilising after a frenzied few years but predicts that 2019 is going to be ""a difficult year"". ""Yearly sales of 2 billion mobile phones seemed so close just a few years ago, but might become a distant dream for the industry,"" she wrote in a report on declining sales. ""Our new five-year outlook is for 1.9 billion units on an annual basis until 2023.""","The days when people camped outside stores to get their hands on the latest smartphone may well be numbered, if recent sales figures are anything to go by."
"By Chris FoxTechnology reporter Sterile male mosquitoes cannot produce offspring when they mate with females. By crowding out other males, they reduce the mosquito population. But spreading them is difficult in areas without roads, so technology organisation WeRobotics has been developing drones to do the job. It will trial the idea in 2018. ""Mosquitoes carry many diseases such as malaria, dengue fever and Zika virus. It makes them one of the biggest animal killers worldwide,"" Adam Klaptocz, WeRobotics co-founder, told the BBC. ""There are lots of methods to control mosquito populations - fumigation, insecticide - but they all have downsides. Insecticide is not good for environment and needs to be constantly deployed."" Releasing sterile insects had been an effective method of population control for a variety of species, he said. Often the sterile insects are released from backpacks carried by the scientists, but it is difficult to spread them over a wide area - and they cannot simply be dumped in one location. WeRobotics was approached by international aid organisations to help produce a solution. ""A lot of the places where these diseases exist are also places where roads do not exist. The drones could spread the mosquitoes where there are no roads,"" said Mr Klaptocz. But one of the challenges is packing hundreds of thousands of fragile mosquitoes into a payload without damaging their thin legs and wings. ""A mosquito that comes out of a drone damaged - or dead - is not going to mate with females,"" said Mr Klaptocz. To protect the insects, they are first cooled to 4-8C, putting them into a sleep-like state that stops them moving around. The next challenge is releasing the insects gradually over a wide area, without waking the whole lot up at once. To do so, the team has designed a rotating platform with holes in, through which individual mosquitoes fall. They land in a holding chamber where they wake up, and can fly out into the wild. ""Community engagement is also a key part of the release campaign,"" Mr Klaptocz told the BBC. ""We may be spreading mosquitoes in areas where they are seen as a vector of death. We need to speak to the local population before a single mosquito is released."" The drones are still in development, but the non-profit company hopes to trial its technology in Latin America in 2018. Mr Klaptocz hopes to focus on areas at risk from Zika virus first.",Drones that scatter swarms of sterile mosquitoes over wide areas are being developed to help stop the spread of diseases such as malaria.
"Dave LeeNorth America technology reporter The 2017 incident left NHS staff reverting to pen and paper after being locked out of computer systems. Park Jin Hyok is said to be linked to the Lazarus Group. The hacking collective is also blamed for the hack on Sony Pictures in 2014. The US Department of Justice alleged the North Korean-backed cyber group had caused major damage. ""The scale and scope of the cyber-crimes alleged by the complaint is staggering and offensive to all who respect the rule of law and the cyber norms accepted by responsible nations,” said the Assistant Attorney General for National Security, John Demers. “The complaint alleges that the North Korean government, through a state-sponsored group; robbed a central bank and citizens of other nations; retaliated against free speech in order to chill it half a world away; and created disruptive malware that indiscriminately affected victims in more than 150 other countries, causing hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars’ worth of damage.” North Korea routinely denies being involved in hack attacks attributed to them. Mr Park is charged with one count of conspiracy to commit computer fraud and abuse, and wire fraud. Prosecutors said Mr Park was believed to be in North Korea. ""North Korea won't be handing over this guy any time soon,"" said Martyn Williams, a North Korea observer and journalist. ""So it likely won't mean much on that level, but it is a symbolic step for the US government to take. ""It helps put meat on the bones of the numerous reports that said North Korea was responsible and is a relatively rare move for the US government."" Fake emails The attribution of cyber-attacks is often very difficult because of the ability of skilled hackers to hide their tracks. The 180-page complaint document goes into detail about why US prosecutors believe Mr Park was heavily involved in the targeted action. It attempts to join the dots by linking various social media aliases with email accounts later used to target those in the financial and entertainment industries. The document includes screenshots of fake emails designed to look like legitimate notes from Facebook, prompting a user to ""simply log in again"" to verify an account. Following the link would bring the victim to a spoof site designed to covertly collect their credentials. Another example was a screenshot of an email from a ""college student"" seeking to send her resume to a Sony Pictures executive - the accompanying link brought the victim to a malicious site. Not all of the group's work was successful, however. The FBI said it had found evidence of a failed attempt to gain access to defence contractor Lockheed Martin. British police assisted the FBI with its investigation. ""The collaboration between UK and US law enforcement has been strong and effective,"" said Steve Rodhouse, head of operations at the National Crime Agency. ""And these charges show that we will not tire in our efforts to identify those who believe they can hide behind a computer and cause havoc across the world, regardless of their motivation or status.""",US prosecutors have charged a North Korean man alleged to have been involved in creating the malicious software used to cripple the UK’s National Health Service.
"Fans will finally get to see a range of yet-to-be-announced titles that are currently in development for the highly anticipated platform. The showcase is one in a series of updates to the console that Sony is set to reveal over the coming months. The Japanese firm will stream the event live at 21:00 BST on YouTube and Twitch. The event was initially set to go ahead on 4 June, but Sony postponed due to the on-going Black Lives Matter protests across the US. All of the new video games showcased at the event will be played on a 4K TV to give a fully-rounded picture of the console's graphic capabilities. Gamers will also be hoping to see the console's custom Solid State Drive (SSD) in action. Sony is hoping it will make loading screens a thing of the past, allowing for large-scale open-world games with little to no barriers. ""We can reasonably expect to see first-party software in action from real PS5 hardware,"" Mark Reed, managing director at Heaven Media told the BBC. ""Days of pre-rendered footage and trailers are coming to an end and Sony knows that gamers expect to see real games on real hardware,"" he added. However, the system itself is expected to remain under wraps until a later date. Price point Sony has sold more than 108 million PS4 units around the world since its launch in November 2013, according to data from Ampere Analysis. Microsoft's Xbox One, which launched during the same period, has sold 49 million units to date. Timi Ofarn, co-head of gaming platform The Nerd Council, told the BBC that PS5's price point would probably play a key role in determining if Sony could maintain its position as market leader. ""If they repeat past mistakes such as the ones they made with the PS3 at launch, we’ll definitely observe a swing in consumer buying,"" suggested Mr Ofarn. The PS3 hit the market in 2006 at a substantially higher price point than any of its rivals, and had a slower start than expected as a result. ""In the end, however, I believe it will come down to the games Sony are offering at launch as to whether we’ll see a shift in Sony outselling Microsoft,"" he added. So far very little is known about PlayStation 5, other than Sony confirming it will be released around Christmas. There are increasing concerns about the availability of stock due to the Covid-19 pandemic slowing down production around the world. ""Demand will be very high indeed for the new hardware,"" said Mr Reed. ""Stock may be an issue, but both companies have committed to launching this year."" The chief executive of Sony Interactive Entertainment, Jim Ryan, claimed earlier this month that the PS5 would represent ""the best in the industry"". He said: ""Studios, both larger and smaller, those newer and those more established, all have been hard at work developing games that will showcase the potential of the hardware.""",Sony will give gamers their first look at the PlayStation 5 during a special event later on Thursday.
"By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor The firm is marketing the steel handset's 5in (12.7cm) screen as offering 17% greater resolution than Apple's higher priced iPhone 5S. It adds that the wristband acts as an ID authenticator, allowing the phone to be unlocked without a password. One expert described the Mi 4 phone as ""another winner"" from a firm that seemed to have ""unstoppable momentum"". Xiaomi (pronounced shiow-me, and meaning little rice) showed off the new kit at a launch event in Beijing. It also revealed that it had sold 57.4 million phones since going into the smartphone business three years ago. In addition, the firm disclosed that its first batch of mobiles to go on sale in India had sold out in 38 minutes earlier in the day. However, it did not say how many were bought. Earlier this month, Samsung Electronics forecast a drop in profits due, in part, to ""increased competition"" from Xiaomi and other rivals in China. The South Korean firm cut the pay of its top executives as a result. Market research firm Canalys recently ranked it as the world's sixth-largest smartphone vendor and China's third-biggest, after Samsung and Lenovo. Low cost, high spec While Xiaomi is little known in the West, where it does not yet sell devices, BusinessWeek magazine recently described it as a ""brand that consumers truly lust after"" in China and other emerging economies. The private-owned company was formed in 2010, and initially only offered its MIUI user interface as add-on software for Android devices. However, it only took it a year to announce its first handset, which included high-end components at a relatively low price - something it achieved by keeping advertising to a minimum and mainly selling its devices online, a strategy it has continued ever since. In 2013, it caused a further stir when it announced that Hugo Barra - one of Google's top Android executives - was leaving the search giant to become Xiaomi's global vice president. ""It seems to have woven together a killer combination of great product at a great price, with an audience that spreads the word for the firm via social media very effectively,"" said Ben Wood, lead researcher at telecoms consultancy CCS Insight. ""Its software offers a very clean and colourful user interface that is constantly being updated, sometimes on a weekly basis. ""The company incorporates changes that have been suggested by customers, and one of the nice touches is that it lets customers know if their ideas are implemented. ""So, it is being incredibly inclusive in terms of getting its users to define the direction of not only the software but also the hardware in some respects."" Activity tracker Unlike most handset makers, Xiaomi's online marketing for the Mi 4 plays up the source of its parts, boasting a ""high colour saturation"" screen from Sharp and the ""fastest"" 13 megapixel rear camera from Sony. The design is reminiscent of Apple's iPhone 5 and marks the Chinese firm's first metal-framed build. It is powered by a quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 2.5Ghz processor - the same as used by the UK edition of Samsung's Galaxy S5. However, Xiaomi offers 3 gigabytes of RAM memory, 50% more than Samsung's device. It is also significantly cheaper, costing 1,999 yuan ($322; £189) for the version with 16GB of storage and 2,499 yuan ($402; £235) for the 64GB edition. The wristband is also keenly priced at 79 yuan ($13; £7.50) - less than a tenth of cost of Fitbit's rival Flex bracelet in China. In addition to unlocking the phone via Bluetooth, the water resistant Mi Band can track activity and sleep, and act as an alarm clock, but lacks a screen. Xiaomi says it lasts up to 30 days between charges. In addition to China and India, the company currently sells its devices in Singapore, the Philippines, Taiwan and Malaysia. It has also announced plans to expand into Thailand, Indonesia, Turkey, Russia and Mexico this year. However, it recently told the Wall Street Journal that an ambition to add Brazil to the list was taking longer than hoped because the South American country's laws meant it would have to assemble devices locally. Mobile's rise The Mi 4 announcement coincides with official figures that indicate more people in China now access the net using a mobile device than via a PC. The China Internet Network Information Center said on Monday that the country had 632 million net users at the end of June - a 2.3% rise on last year's figure. Of that number, 83% used a mobile device and 81% a PC. According to a forecast by research firm IDC, China is now on course to account for about one third of all smartphone shipments by 2018.",China's fast-growing electronics firm Xiaomi has unveiled a new flagship smartphone and companion wristband.
"GTA creator Take-Two issued a ""cease and desist"" letter to Open IV toolkit's creators, saying it aided piracy. Open IV's Russian developers said they did not have time or energy to go to court so have stopped distributing it. Gamers have filled GTA forums with criticism of Take-Two for shutting down the long-running mod toolkit. One player said he hoped the legal claim was a joke, another said it was a ""sad day"" for GTA fans and a third said Take-Two had removed a ""massive selling point"" for the PC version of GTA. Legal limbo ""Almost ten years of my life were dedicated to @OpenIV and now this time is over,"" tweeted Open IV lead developer Good-NTS after deciding to shut down the project. In a message posted to the GTA Forums website, Good-NTS said the team had received a ""cease and desist"" letter on 5 June alleging that it allowed ""third parties to defeat security features of its software and modify that software in violation Take-Two's rights"". He wrote that fighting the claim in court would take months of time and effort and, even if they won, would not help the company more forward. ""Spending time just to restore status quo is really unproductive, and all the money in the world can't compensate the loss of time,"" he said. As a result, Open IV would no longer be available for download. Anyone using the kit is now greeted with a message explaining what has happened when they start up a modified version of GTA. Players are urged to uninstall the software to ""avoid possible legal issues"". The kit has proved hugely popular as it let people who own the single-player version of the game fiddle with its data files to customise objects, models and textures. The tool first appeared in 2011 and a new version for GTA V was released in 2015. In a statement, GTA creator Take-Two said: ""Take-Two's actions were not specifically targeting single player mods. ""Unfortunately OpenIV enables recent malicious mods that allow harassment of players and interfere with the GTA Online experience for everybody. We are working to figure out how we can continue to support the creative community without negatively impacting our players."" ""Game mods have always existed in a legal gray area, and they have often operated via the tacit blessings of rights holders,"" wrote David Kravets, senior editor at new site Ars Technica.","Players of Grand Theft Auto are up in arms after legal threats forced the closure of a popular toolkit used to make add-ons or ""mods"" for the game."
"All the big five movie studios have told Google to remove Android apps that ""pirate"" content, reports Reuters. The rogue apps were taking images and clips from films such as The Hobbit as well as popular TV shows like Glee. About 90% of Oscar-related apps use material that may not have been properly authorised, a survey suggests. 'Growing problem' Brand monitoring firm IP Lasso's study of 100 Oscar themed apps found 90 made use of material they might not have licences to reproduce. Reggie Pierce, head of IP Lasso, told Reuters: ""With the rise of the second screen comes a new band of villains who pose a serious threat to the entertainment industry's move to mobile."" Mr Pierce said film studios were ""actively monitoring"" app stores for programs that did not have licences or permission for the movie and TV show images or clips they use. A spokesman for the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), which represents film studios, told the news agency that apps for smartphones were a ""growing problem"" that needed to be addressed. Most recently action was taken against an Android app called Hobbit 3D Wallpaper HD that let people use stills from the film as a background screen on their handset. Google removed the app soon after being notified about its unlicensed use of images. In the past, film studios have pursued Google, Apple and others over apps that use content from films such as Ted, Spiderman and Green Lantern. The MPAA spokesman said many apps that pirated content were malicious in other ways. ""They also pose risks to consumers from malware and often fail to provide viewers with the quality product they could often get through a growing number of legitimate sources,"" said the spokesman. Ciaran Bradley, head of handset security at security firm Adaptive Mobile, said copyright infringement on phone apps was nothing new and had been seen since the days of ring tones and other extras. However, he said, the MPAA risked overstating the threat posed by apps on official marketplaces. ""When using unofficial channels consumers can expose themselves to more risk, especially if they download free or pirated versions of apps that are normally charged for,"" he said. ""but this applies to all pirated apps not just ones containing Hollywood content.""",Film studios are starting to target mobile applications that use copyrighted images and film clips without permission.
"They will give young people the right to demand social networks delete any personal data they had shared prior to turning 18. The Queen said the UK would retain its ""world-class"" data protection regime. The proposed Data Protection Bill will reflect plans described in the Conservative Party manifesto ahead of the general election in June. In a document further detailing its plans, the government said its key priorities were: The government also said it would implement the General Data Protection Regulation - new EU data protection rules due to come into force in 2018. It said the new UK bill would ensure the country met its obligations while a member of the EU, and would help the UK maintain its ""ability to share data with other EU members states and internationally after we leave the EU"". The new bill will replace the Data Protection Act 1998. Responding to the speech, a spokesman for the technology industry trade body techUK said: ""We support the government's commitment to maintain the UK's world-class protection of people's personal data.

"By Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News The work will involve setting standards for the financial sector in terms of resilience to the type of cyber threats which could undermine the UK economy. The new body - now renamed the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) - was unveiled last year by the Chancellor. It is designed to bring the UK's cyber expertise into one place. Ciaran Martin, currently a senior official at GCHQ, will be the NCSC's first head. ""We need to have a one-stop shop that people inside and outside government can go to,"" Matthew Hancock, the Minister for the Cabinet Office told the BBC, saying that the NCSC will aim to be the authoritative voice on information security in the UK. The new centre is designed to deal with criticism of the current arrangements as too opaque. Wider access GCHQ is the lead agency on cybersecurity but because it is a secret intelligence service based in Cheltenham, it has not always been accessible or set up to share information and communicate more broadly. The new centre is designed to remedy that problem by having a foot in both the closed intelligence world and the public and corporate space. The centre will work with regulators - such as the Bank - to provide advice for the private sector. It will also work with other government departments, critical national infrastructure and the broader business community and the public. The greater the potential risk to the country, the closer the centre is likely to be involved with a particular department or business. In the event of future cyber breaches such as that of Talk-Talk last year, it is likely to be the Centre which acts as the focal point for communication and advice. Those involved stress that the role of government will be to protect the country from cyber-attack and promote good practice but that the liability for any attack that does take place will still rest with whoever owns the data. The NCSC will be based in London and is expected to fully open for business in October. Alongside Ciaran Martin, Dr Ian Levy, currently Technical Director of Cyber Security at GCHQ, will join as Technical Director.","The first task of Britain's new cybersecurity centre will be to work with the Bank of England, the government has announced."
"The vote on the Copyright Directive comes before the European Parliament on 20 June. It aims to rebalance copyright controls for the net age but critics say it will stifle freedom of expression. Net veterans have signed an open letter against the directive and others have made tools to aid lobbying efforts. Lobbying call The wide-ranging directive has emerged from a process started in 2014 to ""modernise"" copyright rules so they support what people do online and make it easier for some organisations, such as schools, to use protected material. Article 13 of the Copyright Directive has given rise to the most protests. Critics say this requires web services to filter everything people put online to ensure what they post does not impinge on any copyrighted material. Web creator Sir Tim Berners-Lee, net pioneer Vint Cerf, Jimmy Wales from Wikipedia, and many others sent an open letter to the European Union this week urging it to scrap the article. In the letter they warned that if Article 13 were to be passed as it is now drafted, it could restrict online life. ""The damage that this may do to the free and open internet as we know it is hard to predict, but in our opinions could be substantial,"" said the letter. ""The cost of putting in place the necessary automatic filtering technologies will be expensive and burdensome, and yet those technologies have still not developed to a point where their reliability can be guaranteed,"" it said. In addition, the Copyright 4 Creativity (C4C) group, which is campaigning against Article 13, this week launched the Save Your Internet site that makes it easier for concerned citizens to email, phone or send tweets to MEPs. Backed by many academic and creative organisations, the C4C group claims Article 13 could ""break"" the internet by putting net firms, rather than users, in charge of what appears online. A detailed analysis of the impact of the Copyright Directive was published this week by Create - a body set up by the UK's research councils to gather and publish research about issues affecting the UK's creative community. It said Article 13 was at odds with established practice that has emerged from cases heard at the European Court of Justice which have been ""against general monitoring"". ""In economic terms, the proposal threatens the benefits of user-led innovation for cultural practices that are rapidly changing,"" it said, adding that a more cautious approach should be taken.",Opponents of proposed European copyright reforms are stepping up efforts to convince politicians to vote against the measures.
"By Dave LeeNorth America technology reporter ARM instructed employees to halt ""all active contracts, support entitlements, and any pending engagements” with Huawei and its subsidiaries to comply with a recent US trade clampdown. ARM's designs form the basis of most mobile device processors worldwide. In a company memo, it said its designs contained “US origin technology”. As a consequence, it believes it is affected by the Trump administration's ban. One analyst described the move, if it became long-term, as an “insurmountable” blow to Huawei’s business. He said it would greatly affect the firm's ability to develop its own chips, many of which are currently built with ARM’s underlying technology, for which it pays a licence. These are used in the Chinese company's 5G base stations and computer servers in addition to its smartphones. Cambridge-headquartered ARM had been described as the UK's largest tech firm until its takeover by a Japanese fund. It employs 6,000 workers and lists eight offices in the US. In a statement on Wednesday it said: ""ARM is complying with the latest restrictions set forth by the US government and is having ongoing conversations with the appropriate US government agencies to ensure we remain compliant. ""ARM values its relationship with our long-time partner HiSilicon and we are hopeful for a swift resolution on this matter."" Huawei has issued a brief statement of its own. ""We value our close relationships with our partners, but recognise the pressure some of them are under, as a result of politically motivated decisions,"" it said. ""We are confident this regrettable situation can be resolved and our priority remains to continue to deliver world-class technology and products to our customers around the world."" What is ARM? ARM is a chip designer founded in 1990. In September 2016 it was acquired by Japanese telecoms giant Softbank, but remains based in Cambridge, UK. ARM does not manufacture computer processors itself, but rather licenses its semiconductor technologies to others. In some cases, manufacturers only license ARM's architecture, or ""instruction sets"", which determine how processors handle commands. This option gives chip-makers greater freedom to customise their own designs. In other cases, manufacturers license ARM's processor core designs - which describes how the chips' transistors should be arranged. These blueprints still need to be combined with other elements - such as memory and radios - to create what is referred to as a system-on-chip. As a result, when you hear talk of a device being powered by a Samsung Exynos, Qualcomm Snapdragon or Apple A11 chip - or one in a Huawei smartphone - it is still ARM's technology that is involved. ARM's US headquarters are in San Jose, California, and the firm has offices in Washington, Arizona, Texas and Massachusetts. Read more: What is ARM and why was it worth $24bn? ‘Unfortunate situation’ ARM’s staff were informed of the decision on 16 May, following the US Commerce Department’s move to add Huawei to its “entity list” of companies with which American firms could no longer do business. The BBC has also seen a company memo dated 18 May detailing the implications of the export ban. On Monday 20 May, US government officials issued a 90-day reprieve on some of the restrictions in order to minimise immediate disruption. But ARM believes that the temporary licence involved does not apply to it. A spokesman for ARM declined to offer any additional clarity about the current status of its Huawei contracts. According to one memo, ARM staff were instructed to suspend all interactions with Huawei and its subsidiaries. It advised staff to send a note informing Huawei (or related) employees that due to an “unfortunate situation”, they were not allowed to “provide support, delivery technology (whether software, code, or other updates), engage in technical discussions, or otherwise discuss technical matters with Huawei, HiSilicon or any of the other named entities”. ARM staff that come into contact with employees at industry events must “politely decline and stop” any conversations about the business, the guidance said - stressing that individuals could be held personally liable for breaking the trade rules. The ban also appeared to apply to ARM China, the China-based company in which ARM Holdings owns a 49% stake. It was set up as a joint venture with a Chinese investment consortium last year in order to enable ARM to develop, sell and offer support for its products in the region. 'Insurmountable obstacle' Huawei told reporters on Tuesday that its “plan B” for software would be to develop its own operating system, something it has already been working on for some time. However, it will be significantly more difficult for the firm to source home-grown components of sufficient quality. Huawei currently sources some of its chips from HiSilicon, which it owns. However, while produced in China, HiSilicon’s chips are built using underlying technology created by ARM. While HiSilicon and Huawei are free to carry on using and manufacturing existing chips, the ban would mean the company could no longer turn to ARM for assistance in developing components for devices in future. HiSilicon's upcoming processor, Kirin 985, is due be used in Huawei devices later this year. According to a source at ARM, it is not expected to be affected by the ban. However, the next iteration of the chip has not yet been completed - and is likely to need to be rebuilt from scratch, the source said. Huawei also uses ARM's designs for its recently unveiled Kunpeng chips. These are used to power its TaiShan-series computer servers, which are designed to provide cloud computing and storage to clients. In addition, the company told analysts in January that the Tiangang chip at the heart of its 5G base stations is also ARM-based. ""The problem of the whole telecoms industry is that so much of it is based on the exchange of technology between different companies - whether that's chip companies, software providers or the makers of other hardware,"" commented Alan Burkitt-Gray, editor-at-large of the telecoms news site Capacity Media. He added that Huawei would likely face other problems licensing 5G-related tech from others, and in turn US-based companies would now be unable to licence the Chinese company's 5G inventions. ""This will carve out a chasm in the industry between Huawei-originated intellectual property and the rest of the world's,"" he said. ""It's just a total mess and it's happened at a critical time for the rollout of 5G."" The relationship between ARM and Huawei engineers is tight - earlier this month Huawei announced its intention to build a research centre only 15 minutes from ARM’s headquarters in Cambridge, UK. ""ARM is the foundation of Huawei’s smartphone chip designs, so this is an insurmountable obstacle for Huawei,” said Geoff Blaber, from CCS Insight. ""That said, with an abundance of companies in Huawei’s supply chain already having taken action to comply with the US order, Huawei’s ability to operate was already severely affected.” What is not yet clear is whether ARM is acting on its own interpretation of the US rules, or whether it has been advised by the Commerce Department. ""If that interpretation is correct, that’s going to affect every semiconductor company in the world,” remarked analyst Lee Ratliff, from IHS Markit. ""They’re not going to be able to easily replace these parts with new, in-house designs - the semiconductor industry in China is nascent.” _______ Additional reporting by Leo Kelion Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC Do you have more information about this or any other technology story?

"By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter It is a point not lost on Education Secretary Michael Gove, who wants to radically overhaul the ICT curriculum by next September. He wants to do two quite opposite things: modernise and go back to basics. The retro approach would see pupils return to the ""beneath the bonnet"" lessons of the 1980s when schoolchildren had little choice but to learn to code because computers were altogether less intuitive. As part ofBBC News' School Report project, pupils at the thoroughly modern Lampton School in Hounslow have been investigating what children think about the current curriculum and plans to change it. In a survey of 100 pupils, the school reporters found mixed feelings about the changes. Thirty-five percent disagreed with Mr Gove's view of ICT as ""dull"", while 28% thought it was a good idea to make changes. The rest were undecided. In part it is down to the fact that Lampton has embraced ICT. While nationally only about a third of ICT teachers are trained specialists, at Lampton all four are. As a result they have been teaching programming in the classroom for a while. ""We changed the curriculum a long time ago to make it more interesting. It depends on the school and how much presence they give to the subject,"" said David Lawley, an ICT teacher at the school. Use of Game Maker software in class has already inspired Year 8 coding wizard Will to create his own game at home. For him the idea of doing more is highly appealing. ""Coding is a great way of learning. When you've done something good like a game you get to take it home and play on it,"" he told the School Reporters. But for others the most basic skills are more than enough. ""You don't need more unless you want to do ICT in your career. People are already addicted to computer games without having to make their own,"" said Year 8 pupil Hira. David Carpenter is an ICT teacher at Chiselhurst and Sidcup Grammar School. He thinks there are always way to make potentially dull topics interesting. ""We do a module based around superheroes. the kids have to work out which supervillain destroyed the database. They love it and don't even realise that they are learning about databases,"" he said. Digital leaders Mr Gove was unavailable for interview but Schools Minister Nick Gibb sent the children a statement. ""It is important that the ICT curriculum taught in schools is inspirational and challenging,"" he said. ""It needs to equip young people with a real understanding of how computers work and the programming expertise that underpins the software. ""We want young people to be leaving school with the ability to create their own apps and to help our world-leading computer software industry to maintain that lead."" He did not address the question of how the government would make up for the shortfall in specialist teachers. But the George Spencer Academy in Nottingham may hint at part of the solution. Teachers there have acknowledged that often it is the children who are the experts. A group of so-called digital leaders, aged 11-16, are running workshops for teachers on how to use programs such as Prezi, cloud-based presentation software similar to Powerpoint. ""They are using technology all the time and are up to date with technology that we haven't used yet,"" said English teacher Hayley Randall. ""They can offer us innovative ideas to make our lessons more interesting."" Piece of Pi? Many think there is a sea-change occurring in education at the moment. The Raspberry Pi mini-computer is designed to encourage children to take up programming, and has captured the imagination of many technology enthusiasts. With its £22 ($35) price-tag it is affordable even on pocket-money budgets. The machine is supplied without monitor, keyboard or mouse and runs a freely available operating system and a ""start-up"" educational coding tool. Children are expected to cut their coding teeth largely through creating their own games and other functions on the cheap machine. IT entrepreneur James Parsons says strong demand for the device suggests that young people are ""hungry"" to code. But he says other radical changes are needed. ""Currently the ICT taught in schools is more to do with how to use programmes rather than how to create them,"" he said. ""The web has democratised business opportunities: if you can code and understand programming, you give yourself a huge advantage"" Young experts It was a point that Google chief executive Eric Schmidt appeared to endorse on a trip to the UK last year. He told his audience that the country's failure to teach software development meant it was ""throwing away your great computer heritage"". Prof Steve Furber, designer of the BBC Micro, is very much part of that heritage. The Micro was the cornerstone of technology in schools during the 1980s. As part of their investigation, the Lampton school reporters interviewed Prof Furber via Skype and asked him how he would change the curriculum. ""Digital literacy - using programs such as Excel, Word and Powerpoint - everyone needs to be able to do that, but they also need to realise that there are far more creative things than using a program someone has written for you,"" he told them. ""These days it is important to have a good idea about how computers work, whatever skills you go on to pursue."" In a report for the Royal Society,Prof Furber called for ICT to be scrapped entirely, and replaced with a compulsory digital literacy module and optional courses in computer science and more business-focused IT. But how, the School Reporters asked him, would it be taught when only a third of current ICT teachers were actually specialists? ""What we would hope is that when schools are identifying teachers, they look for those with the right specialist qualifications,"" said Prof Furber. Technology is getting more and more user-friendly. Children are now commonly referred to as ""digital natives"" because they have grown up with gadgets their parents could only dream of. The question going forward will be whether teachers and the school curriculum can keep pace with this new generation of super-users.","Technology is central to most young people's lives, but there is a disconnect between how they use it at home and how they are taught it."
"The Blackberry Leap is not the company's first all-touch phone - but it may come as a surprise, since its chief executive said last March his focus was going to be ""very keyboard-centric"". The Canadian company has also revealed it is bringing more of its software to rival platforms. Sales of Blackberry phones are falling. The company shipped 7.9 million devices last year, according to research firm Gartner. That was a big drop on 2013's figure of 18.6 million units, which in turn was well down on 2011's tally of 51.5 million handsets. A separate study by research company eMarketer indicates the number of UK-based Blackberry users is set to dip to 700,000 this year, having been as high as 2.5 million in 2013. Crowded market Blackberry's Leap runs on its proprietary 10.3.1 operating system and features: The specifications place it firmly as a mid-range, rather than premium, handset. Blackberry says it believes the phone will appeal to ""career-building"" young professionals and businesses that value security and privacy. But one expert thought the device might struggle to find a market, bearing in mind Microsoft, LG, Motorola and Sony were among other companies to have released rival mid-range phones over recent days, adding to an already crowded market. ""Looking at how Blackberry sales have fallen off a cliff, it seems to me difficult to see how it will come back from that, particularly when you're at an event like Mobile World Congress and seeing so many other mid-range, middle-of-the-road handsets,"" said eMarketer analyst Bill Fisher. ""Blackberry is not doing enough to differentiate itself at a time [when] we're seeing a plethora of such phones in this space."" Ben Wood, from the CCS Insight consultancy, was only slightly more positive. ""Blackberry will find it tough to compete with the iPhone and Android devices, but the Leap will be essential to offer a more rounded portfolio of phones,"" he said. Blackberry also briefly teased a more distinctive device at its press conference - a curved-screened phone with a keyboard that slides out from below its screen. However, it did not name the model or provide further details. Software bundles The other part of Blackberry's strategy is to provide access to its services to rival platforms. The company announced it would offer three new different bundles of services - called Experience Suites - for a fee, to iOS, Android and Windows Phone handsets. These provide access to its calendar, secure email, Universal Search, password management and virtual-keyboard tools, among others. ""[Customers] want Blackberry's legendary security and core productivity and collaboration capabilities while still being able to choose a device that matches their lifestyle and personality,"" said the company's chief executive John Chen. The pitch comes at a time when Google, Microsoft and Apple are touting their own apps and services as being business-friendly. But one expert said the Blackberry Experience Suites could prove popular. ""There's definitely still a demand and fondness from the business community for Blackberry products,"" said Chris Green, from the Davies Murphy Group consultancy. ""You can't underestimate how much the business world likes the Blackberry platform, so doing more to integrate it with their back-end systems to run apps on other devices will go down well."" Mr Fisher added that it might even bring some users back to the company's own phones. ""Blackberry's software is good, so potentially there could be a halo effect if people see they like the apps and are then attracted back to the hardware,"" he said. ""There's money to be made in software, but if you can monetise that in your own operating software and hardware, there's even more to be earned. ""But is it too late for that [for Blackberry]? Possibly.""","Blackberry has announced a touch-screen phone without physical keys, at the Mobile World Congress trade show."
"By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor ""Tablets will rule the future,"" one analyst said three years ago, forecasting sales would swell to 375 million in 2016. Nobody is that bullish anymore. The tablet sector recently suffered its first drop, according to tech consultancy Canalys - down 12% over the final three months of 2014 compared with the same period the previous year. Apple - the market leader - sold 15% fewer iPads over 2014 as a whole compared with 2013. Barcelona's Mobile World Congress (MWC) will attempt to reinvigorate interest next week - a Sony leak indicates its will unveil a model with ""industry-leading battery performance"". But research house Gartner is now saying the sector's growth will be limited to 259 million sales next year, meaning PCs will continue to be more popular. Tablet stats: Worldwide tablet sales : (source: Gartner) Apple's iPads are the bestselling brand. Between 3 April 2010, when the original went on sale, and 27 December 2014, the end of the Apple's last financial quarter, the US company sold: (source: Apple) Cheap ""brand X"" tablets - such as Tesco's Hudl - have proved popular. Combine the various companies together, and they outsell their better known competitors. In 2014, their respective market shares were: (source: Strategy Analytics) Despite being outsold by phones, tablets punch above their weight when it comes to internet shopping. A study of purchases made in the UK indicates that over 2014 the two classes of categories generated: (source: eMarketer - data excludes travel and event tickets) Tablets v phablets One suggestion is that the experts got carried away with the early rush to the tills. ""The initial growth that got people excited was inflated by the fact that early-adopters adopted faster than usual,"" Carolina Milanesi, chief of research at KWP Comtech tells the BBC. ""In other words, the initial sales curve was steeper than that for smartphones, and this led to the idea that tablets would do much better than they have. ""What happened, though, was that it became apparent that the value proposition to your average Joe on the street wasn't clear. People asked, 'Why do I need to get this when my phone already does a lot of the same things?'"" For those that did buy, and love running apps on a larger screen, there may also be little pressure to upgrade. ""We're getting bigger and bigger phones - the iPhone 6 Plus is big, the latest Samsung handsets are big - so there's less differentiation between the two categories,"" says Michael O'Hara, from the GSM Association, which hosts MWC. ""And operators offer less subsidies for tablets [because most are bought without a Sim card], so that's also probably a factor in the refresh cycle."" By spreading the cost of a new handset across the lifetime of a contract, operators not only make it seem relatively cheap to switch to a new smartphone, they also protect the profit margins of top-end mobiles. By contrast, Android-device manufacturers, in particular, have felt the need to make the prices of their tablets more keen. This becomes apparent if you try to buy the devices from them off-contract. For example: All of which gives the device makers an added incentive to focus their marketing spend on their phones rather than their tablets. Read and watch Furthermore, many of the things that drive consumers to buy new phones - better cameras, built-in footstep trackers, fingerprint sensors, touch-and-pay facilities and extended battery life - don't have the same appeal if offered on tablets, since the bigger devices are less likely to be used outdoors. And despite the efforts of Microsoft, Apple and Google to convince us that their latest models can be used to make complex spreadsheets, videos, music and more, many want to use them to consume media rather than create it. ""If you just want to read stuff and watch Netflix on your tablet at home, some of the early tablets are just as good as the latest devices,"" says Stuart Miles, founder of the gadget review site Pocket-lint. ""If you are intrigued by a tablet, you've probably already bought one, so there really needs to be a paradigm shift, a change in what it offers you, to convince you to upgrade."" That's not to say innovation is limited to making tablets thinner. Lenovo recently unveiled the Yoga Tablet 2 Pro, which features a built-in projector and subwoofer. The pitch is that this could be useful for presentations and letting groups watch movies together, although reviewers suggest the low resolution and brightness of the projector limits its appeal. Perhaps more intriguing is the fact that the Yoga's screen is 13.3in (33.8cm) - much bigger than the norm. Microsoft has also gone large with its 12in (30.5cm) Windows-powered Surface Pro 3, Samsung has introduced a 12.2in (31cm) tablet and there are rumours Apple is working on a similarly proportioned iPad. Bigger, better? When it comes to tablets, Ms Milanesi thinks size will count if consumers, schools and businesses are to consider them PC-replacements. ""If you are working with productivity apps, like Office, having a bigger screen helps,"" she says. ""Plus, if you don't want to use an external keyboard, having a larger screen gives you more real estate so less of it is covered when you type. ""It also helps with multitasking - having your Twitter feed or email on one side and being able to write a document on the other side, or students having a text book on one side and writing on the other - it's just more flexible."" However, she notes, the shift also makes tablets considerably less comfortable to carry around. Tim Coulling, an analyst at Canalys, suggests IBM's tie-up with Apple to create business-focused apps also points the way towards tablets being used more commonly in the workplace. ""There are a lot of job functions where tablets make perfect sense - for service workers out in the field, for example, or point-of-sale devices in shops,"" he says. The release of Windows 10 later this year may also drive demand. But, Mr Coulling adds, the days of rapid growth may be over. ""The tablet market isn't going to crash, but we're reaching a plateau now that it's become saturated,"" he says.","Not long ago, we were assured the iPad and its ilk were destined to dominate our everyday lives."
"The suspensions and shutdowns were part of a concerted effort by Twitter to clear up the platform, said the paper. Many of the accounts are thought to be used by trolls or remotely controlled bots that abuse the service. Twitter declined to comment on the Post story but said it was making an effort to ""improve"" public conversation on the social network. Cat and mouse Juan Guzman, a researcher at UCL who has exposed hundreds of thousands of bots on social media, said Twitter had neglected tackling automatic tweet generators for years. ""Until recently, Twitter did not think bots were a problem on its platform and did not lead a strong bot-detection effort,"" he told the BBC. ""It was only after Brexit and the 2016 election, where these bots became a liability and Twitter, as well as Facebook began taking them seriously."" Del Harvey, Twitter's head of trust and safety, told the paper that it was now erring more on the side of ""preserving safety"" rather than supporting free speech at all costs. ""One of the biggest shifts is in how we think about balancing free expression versus the potential for free expression to chill someone else's speech,"" said Ms Harvey. ""Free expression doesn't really mean much if people don't feel safe,"" she said. A spokesman for Twitter said the Washington Post report was ""nothing new"" and added that the account suspensions were part of its ""ongoing work to improve the health of the public conversation on Twitter"". The spokesman pointed to a blog by Yoel Roth and Ms Harvey, which talked about how Twitter tackled spam and bots on its service. It had also taken action against 142,000 applications that had pumped more than 130 million ""low-quality, spammy"" tweets into Twitter, he added. Last month, Twitter also acquired Smyte, a company specialising in technology that helps people tackle spam, abuse and fraud. But Mr Guzman, who has helped create the Astroscreen software to spot bots, said it was only going to get harder for Twitter to spot and remove the junk accounts. ""There is a cat-and-mouse game between the botmakers and social networks, whereby botmakers quickly update their methods to avoid detection,"" he said. ""With breakthroughs like conversational AI, you'll see bots in the future being harder to detect."" The Washington Post report has been cited as one cause of Twitter's stock price recording an 8.5% fall - its biggest in three months. Morningstar analyst Ali Mogharabi said the fall was probably prompted by the assumption that a lower user count would mean less advertising cash.","Twitter has shut down up to 70 million fake and suspicious accounts since May, according to the Washington Post."
"The annual analysis of data breaches by Verizon uncovered a huge rise in politically motivated attacks. Verizon found that 58% of all the data stolen during breaches in 2011 was purloined by these groups. Hacktivists were hard to defend against, it said, as their attack strategies were much harder to predict. The Verizon report catalogued 855 incidents around the world in which 174 million records were stolen. Data defences ""Hacktivism has been around for a some time but it's mainly been website defacements,"" said Wade Baker, director of research and intelligence at Verizon. ""In 2011 it was more about going to steal a bunch of information from a company."" The hacktivist attacks were spearheaded by the Anonymous hacker group and its tech-savvy offshoots Antisec and Lulzsec. These activists scored a significant number of successes by knocking out websites and stealing large amounts of data from private companies and government agencies. ""Data theft became a mechanism for political protest,"" said Mr Baker. He added that it was hard to develop specific defences against these attacks because they used tactics and techniques crafted for each occasion. He said the attacks by hacktivists were not very common but often netted huge amounts of data when they did penetrate defences. In contrast to that stolen by hacktivists, about 35% of data pilfered from large companies was taken by organised criminal groups which wanted to sell it or use it to commit another crime. Mr Baker said cybercriminals continued to be a huge threat to large companies, and constantly battered their internet defences looking for weaknesses. These attacks, he said, tended to be opportunistic and capitalised on any loopholes and vulnerabilities they found. While few firms were going out of business or suffering lasting damage because of a data breach, he said, companies still had work to do to ensure they knew they were safe. ""The ability to detect a breach is quite poor across the board,"" said Mr Baker.","Hacktivists stole more data from large corporations than cybercriminals in 2011, according to a study of significant security incidents."
"By Zoe Kleinman and Cristina CriddleTechnology reporters The firm is increasing the number of products which will contain its own in-house developed M1 chip, as the sector struggles with a global semiconductor shortage. It finally unveiled its much-anticipated tracker tile, the AirTag, which will launch at the end of April. And it announced its first significant update to the iconic iMac desktop computer in recent years. It also showcased a new iPad Pro, complete with M1 chip and 5G connectivity. What was not discussed, but was later shared by Apple, was the roll-out of the latest version of its operating system, iOS 14.5, which will include a controversial update limiting what app owners can see about user activity outside of their own apps without permission. It's a popular business model for ""free"" internet services, including Facebook, which use the data they gather on their members' online habits to target advertising. AirTags AirTags have been highly-anticipated by Apple fans. They are small round disks which can be attached to anything, and transmit a Bluetooth signal to a home gadget - an iPad or iPhone - to alert the user to their location. The original Tile tracker, a rival product, launched following a successful crowdfunding campaign in 2014. AirTags will cost £29 ($29 in US) and are due to launch on April 30, said Apple engineering program manager Carolyn Wolfman-Estrada. They work with all devices containing the U1 chip, which includes the iPhone 11 (which launched in 2019) and later models. She also said they were designed to ""track items not people"", with features such as rotating identifiers and audible alerts from unknown tags built in to protect privacy. iMac Colleen Novielli showed off new super-thin iMacs in seven different colours, built with Apple's new M1 chip, and a 24in, 11.3 million pixel screen, along with a revamped camera and other upgrades. One of Apple's older products, the iMac has not seen a significant revamp for years. However, it only has a top RAM (the device's short-term memory) of 16GB, putting it on a par with the older Mac Mini. ""It is little surprise Apple has resisted updating the iMac over the last few years, given the transformational impact the M1 architecture has had on the overall design,"" commented Leo Gebbie from CCS insight. ""This is an endorsement of Apple's multi-year, multi-billion-dollar investment in creating its own silicon platforms which now power all its key devices."" 5G comes to iPad The M1 chip, an ultra-wide camera and 5G data connectivity are all coming to the new iPad Pro, said product manager Raja Bose. The M1 chip will make the latest version's graphics performance 1,500 times faster than the original, he said, in a presentation which focused on the iPad's graphics and gaming benefits. The new model will also feature up to 2 terabytes of storage. According to analysts IDC, the tablet market overall grew in 2020 for the first time in seven years, with sales driven by consumers and education providers during the global pandemic. ""Tablets emerged as a reliable alternative for consumers to meet their needs for content consumption and provide access to remote schooling during the lockdown,"" said Daniel Goncalves from IDC. Mr Goncalves added that many households had bought extra tablets in the last 12 months, in order to keep up with their increased use. Apple also announced a new subscription podcast platform, in keeping with its move towards streaming services, first announced in 2019. And it showed off a new 4K Apple TV, with a re-designed Siri remote and HDR (High Dynamic Range). HDR offers a greater range of colours, making pictures more vivid and realistic. Sky launched an HDR service last year for a selection of its nature documentaries - but only to customers with specific premium subscriptions. This launch wasn't exactly chock-a-block with surprises. The move to Apple's own silicon has so far been a success. The new M1 chip Macbooks have had rave reviews - so it was only a matter of time before Apple switched its other products over to the new design. The new iMacs and iPads will be the fastest and most powerful ever - though it would of course be preposterous if they weren't. Interestingly Apple also announced its much speculated AirTags. You'll be able to attach it to your keys or your dog's collar, anything. If you lose them, you'll be able to find it using your phone. This looks very much like a product already on the market, Tile - though AirTags appears at first view to have a different tracking system. This is another example in the long line of Big Tech companies borrowing/copying ideas from smaller companies, and it's these kinds of moves that many US lawmakers don't like. And this launch was interesting too for what wasn't discussed. It was speculated that Apple might launch its new app tracking transparency feature - and we now know the latest version of its operating system, iOS 14.5, is due out next week. Apple wants to limit how companies follow you on the internet on Apple devices. It says it wants to protect its customer's privacy. Platforms like Facebook, that relies heavily on ad revenue, is against the move. However this evening's event was all about the products.",Apple has shown off its latest product line-up in its first big event of 2021.
"He made the comment in an interview with news channel CBS, in which he also talked about his controversial behaviour on Twitter. In September, the SEC decided to sue him for alleged securities fraud. This followed a tweet in which Mr Musk wrote that he had secured funding to take Tesla off the stock market and make it a private company. The SEC said the claim was ""false and misleading"". Mr Musk said he and Tesla had chosen to pay the $20m (£15m) settlement fine because while he did not respect the regulator, he did believe in the justice system. As part of the settlement, he also had to step down as Tesla's chairman and was told that his tweets should be monitored. Days later, he took to Twitter to mock the regulator, describing it as the ""Shortseller Enrichment Commission"" and praising its ""incredible work"". In a newly released interview with CBS, he told reporter Lesley Stahl that he ""preferred"" not having a title but added that his tweets were still unsupervised. ""The only tweets that would have to be, say, reviewed would be if a tweet had a probability of causing a movement in the stock,"" he said. ""Otherwise it's, 'Hello, First Amendment,' he added, referring to the US right to free speech. Elon Musk is well known for his fiery tweets. He described the social media platform as ""a warzone"".

"The YouTube video was shot on the Apple campus in September when the young woman met her father for lunch. The video was widely shared after being spotted by tech news sites and blogs that watch Apple. She said her father was fired for breaking Apple's strict policy that bans filming on its campus. Apple has not yet confirmed that the man has been fired nor responded to a request for comment. No grudge News of the firing emerged when Brooke Peterson posted a follow-up video explaining why the original, in which she was seen trying out the iPhone X, was no longer available. Ms Peterson said Apple had asked for the ""innocent"" video to be taken down and said that its posting had led to her father being fired. Although Ms Peterson removed the video from her YouTube pages it has been widely copied online. The video shows Ms Peterson trying out the iPhone X while eating lunch with her father. This demo also inadvertently revealed some Apple employee only QR codes and a text file of codenames for unreleased Apple devices. ""At the end of the day when you work for Apple, it doesn't matter how good of a person you are, if you break a rule, they just have no tolerance,"" said Ms Peterson. ""Apple really did like my dad. And they let him go. Because he broke a rule,"" she said. ""It was an innocent mistake, and he fully apologises."" Mr Peterson is believed to have been employed at Apple for four years and worked on the iPhone's radio frequency and wireless technologies. Ms Peterson added that the family bore Apple no grudge and that her father was going to be ""OK"".",Apple has reportedly fired one of its engineers after his daughter posted a video of the iPhone X before the official launch.
"By Dan SimmonsClick presenter Created by entrepreneur Will Donaldson, Nomx says it uses the ""world's most secure communications protocol"" to protect email messages. But security analysts cracked the device's simple passwords and hacked its hardware and software. Defending itself, Nomx disputed the way the tests were done on its gadget. Hardware exposed The Nomx personal email server costs from $199 - $399 (£155 - £310) and its publicity material claims it is designed to handle email communications for consumers. It says that using a dedicated personal server, users can help to stop messages being copied and hacked as they travel to their destination across the net. BBC Click asked security researcher Scott Helme and computer security expert Prof Alan Woodward, from the University of Surrey, to scrutinise Nomx. They were asked to assess whether it did let people send messages in a way that was secure against hacking and interception. The investigation started by taking the device apart to find that it was built around a £30 Raspberry Pi computer. As the operating system for the Pi sits on a removable memory card, Mr Helme was able to download the device's core code so he could examine it closely. This allowed Mr Helme to run it as if he were the administrator for the device. He discovered that the software packages it used to handle mail were not proprietary and many were very old versions, five years old in one case, harbouring unpatched security bugs. Default passwords found in the code included ""password"" and ""death"". Mr Helme also found many problems with the web interface Nomx uses to administer the secure email service. This was vulnerable to several widely known and easy to execute attacks that, if exploited, would give attackers control over a target's Nomx system. He also found a way to create a hidden administrator's account on the Nomx box that would allow any attacker to fully compromise the gadget. In addition, Mr Helme found more than 10 other issues with the Nomx box that left him ""horrified"" by its approach to security. The analysis was reviewed by Paul Moore - an experienced tester of secure hardware. Mr Moore said the Nomx was an ""overpriced and outdated mail server"" and used one of the ""most insecure PHP applications"" he had ever encountered. Update cycle In an emailed response to Click, Mr Donaldson thanked Mr Helme and Prof Woodward for finding and sharing information about Nomx's vulnerabilities. Addressing the issue of old software, he said Nomx planned to let users choose which updates should be applied to their device. ""We will selectively allow users to pick and choose when that becomes available but today we're not forcing any types of updates,"" he said, adding that updates can introduce vulnerabilities. ""Updates actually cause a cascading effect and now you're patching patches and that is not a good place to be in,"" he told Click. The default names and passwords found by Mr Helme were used to make it easy for customers to set up their device and they were encouraged to change it afterwards, he said. Mr Helme said the set-up process for the Nomx was far from easy and at no point was he told to pick a new password. Late on 27 April, Nomx published a strong defence of its product and disputed the way in which Mr Helme tested the device. Mr Donaldson said Mr Helme's tests were unrealistic, as they involved actions no typical user would undertake. Nomx said the threat posed by the attack detailed by Mr Helme was ""non-existent for our users"". Following weeks of correspondence with Mr Helme and the BBC Click Team, he said the firm no longer shipped versions that used the Raspberry Pi. Instead, he said, future devices would be built around different chips that would also be able to encrypt messages as they travelled. ""The large cloud providers and email providers, like AOL, Yahoo, Gmail, Hotmail - they've already been proven that they are under attack millions of times daily,"" he said. ""Why we invented Nomx was for the security of keeping your data off those large cloud providers. ""To date, no Nomx accounts have been compromised."" The BBC Click show dedicated to this investigation will air on 29 April on the BBC News Channel and iPlayer, where it will also be available afterwards.","A BBC Click investigation has thrown doubt on claims that the small, personal email server Nomx can provide ""absolute security""."
"By Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent But the company knows it lacks one thing - even in China it isn't seen as a cool brand. Eight years ago, Lenovo's takeover of IBM's PC division transformed a virtually unknown brand into a global contender. It has built on that acquisition, renewing products like the Thinkpad, and in October, the research firm Gartner said the Chinese company had finally overtaken the long-term market leader HP. But at Lenovo's headquarters in Beijing they know the contest is not over and they now have a new task - to build a brand which consumers love as well as respect. ""My goal is that one day Lenovo can be recognised as one of the hundred most valuable brands in the world,"" says Arthur Wei. This fast talking marketing executive who came to Lenovo from HP has already taken the company from nowhere to number one in the Russian market, and has been rewarded with a major role at headquarters. Olympic designer In an exhibition centre showcasing Lenovo's products over the years, Mr Wei proudly plays me a video of a recent launch, where a new laptop was unveiled in a glitzy fashion show attended by a crowd of excited celebrities. This, he indicates, is where a company that for years made dull beige boxes at keen prices is heading now. But upstairs in Lenovo's design centre is the man who is vital to changing consumer perceptions of the business. Dressed casually in jeans and a grey turtle neck sweater, Yao Yingjia is Lenovo's equivalent of Apple's design guru Sir Jonathan Ive. Mr Yao was the first industrial designer to be brought into the company in the 1990s. In 2008, he led the team which designed the Olympic torch for Beijing and he now heads a team which obsesses over the look and feel of every new product. Caressing the Yoga Thinkpad - a laptop which converts into a touchscreen tablet - he talks in terms that sound remarkably similar to those employed by Apple's Sir Jonathan: ""It's creating a new emotion,"" he says. ""It really touches the customer."" The Yoga is a good indicator of the thinking of a company that rejects the idea that the PC is dead but talks of a ""PC plus"" strategy. Recognising that much of the innovation is now in the mobile computing area, Lenovo has been building a strong position in China's smartphone and tablet market, and is now moving into other territories. It describes its approach as ""protect and attack"" - protect its lead in markets like China, while attacking new territories and product areas. ""It took us four years to become number one in Russia by utilising the attack strategy,"" says Mr Wei. ""We're also number one in India, and in Germany and Japan. So the attack strategy not only works in emerging markets but in mature markets too."" Foreign favourites Yet for all this success, go out on China's teeming shopping streets and Lenovo's brand still seems to need some polishing. The devices that attract attention and envy are those made by Samsung - whose Galaxy Note appears to be the smartphone of choice for young IT professionals - and of course Apple. Chinese consumers have been snapping up Lenovo smartphones, but at far lower prices than what they seem willing to pay for an iPhone or a Samsung device. In a Beijing apartment, we gathered a small focus group of three savvy consumers who worked in IT and asked them to name their favourite gadgets. Each had an iPad, and on the coffee table there were phones made by Samsung, Nokia and Apple - but none named a Lenovo device as something they would show off to their friends. When I asked them why that was the case, one man explained it like this. ""I would brag about it, but only because it's a Chinese product - we have lower standards for homemade products."" Made in Hong Kong Back at Lenovo's HQ, a guide showed me around an exhibition devoted to Lenovo's history. It starts with a replica of the post-room or security cabin where a handful of people, all members of China's Institute of Computing, started the company in 1984. Then there is the first product, an accessory for PCs allowing them to display Chinese characters for the first time - a big moment for early computer users in China. But getting a licence from the government to make computers proved tricky, and it was in Hong Kong that the first PCs under the brand name Legend were produced. The exhibition comes right up to date with the smiling faces of the men who hatched the IBM deal, and then the products that have emerged since. Mr Wei, who spent his early career abroad working for American firms before heading home top China, says Lenovo's success has been about continually reinventing itself. ""If you keep pushing yourself as a start-up company, you're fighting for survival even though you're number one,"" he says. ""That's the reason this company has a chance to win."" For executives like Mr Wei and Mr Yao, being number one is not enough. They want consumers the world over to brag about owning Lenovo products, and they believe they are well on the way to making that happen.","China's Lenovo is on a roll. It has just been named the world's number one PC seller, and it has rapidly won the number two spot in mobile phones in its home market."
"The trousers are intended to stop thieves hacking into radio frequency identification (RFID) tagged passports or contactless payment cards. According to security experts this type of theft is a growing problem. The jeans are designed by online clothing company Betabrand and use a silver-based material to block signals. They are due to go on sale in February. Security software maker Norton teamed up with San Francisco-based Betabrand in October to make the jeans and a blazer. The jeans will retail at $151 (£96) and the blazer at $198. Digital forensic firm Disklabs has used similar technology to make a wallet, which, like the Betabrand jeans, blocks RFID signals. ""There is technology readily available for anyone to snatch other people's credit and debit card data within seconds,"" said Disklabs boss Simon Steggles. ""These apps simply copy the card with all the information on it."" His firm also designs ""faraday"" bags which block mobile signals. Such bags are often used by police now to store mobile phones taken from suspects. Last month the BBC reported that several police forces around the country had admitted that some mobile phones confiscated from suspects had been remotely wiped because they had not been stored in a secure way. Wearable hacks Ethical hacker Ken Munro is also acutely aware of the problem of RFID hacking. His firm, Pen Test Partners, has developed him a proof-of-concept RFID-blocking suit. Made of cloth woven with metal fibres, the suit was not cheap to make but is washable. ""If we are not explicitly blocking these signals there are a lot of things that can go wrong, from stealing contactless payment card details to more life-threatening issues,"" he told the BBC. He thinks the RFID jeans may not be a sufficient defence against hackers. ""The pockets are shielded but nothing else. Stuff in your pockets is easy to shield with a wallet or similar. Our suit is different - the entire thing is shielded."" This becomes important as more and more RFID technology, such as wearable insulin pumps or in-chest monitoring devices, becomes standard, he said. ""These are the devices where tampering or hacking over radio frequency could be life-threatening,"" he said. ""I'm not sure that medical device manufacturers have given enough thought to security.""",A pair of jeans containing material that blocks wireless signals is being developed in conjunction with anti-virus firm Norton.
"Hamburg's privacy commissioner said that the technology was collecting users' biometric information and ordered the data be deleted. The commissioner has the power to levy a fine of up to 300,000 euros (£261,000). Facebook said it would be considering the claim, but rejected the accusation that it had broken the law. In a statement, a company spokesperson added: ""People like the convenience of our photo tag suggest feature which makes it easier and safer for them to manage their online identities."" Private database Facebook introduced facial recognition to its photos application in June. The system suggests the identity of users' friends while they are tagging images. The site came under fire at the time based on the erroneous belief that the technology could be used to identify strangers. In reality, it is restricted to a user's friends. However, the concerns of Hamburg's information commissioner, Dr Johannes Caspar, centre around the fact that the social network is building a private database of faces. ""The risks of such a collection of biometric data is immense,"" said Dr Caspar. The commissioner's office told the BBC that it would be seeking an explanation from Facebook and that if no satisfactory response was received it would pursue an official hearing. It is not the first time that Dr Caspar's office has tackled Facebook over privacy-related issues. In July 2010 the commissioner initiated legal proceedings over the use of email addresses belonging to people who hadn't joined Facebook. Their contact details were being uploaded to the site by friends who were members. As a result, Facebook changed the feature in Germany to notify users that the site might use the contacts to send unsolicited messages to their friends.",Facebook is being accused of violating German privacy laws with its facial recognition system.
"The closures follow an announcement in May, when Reddit said it would be enforcing its anti-harassment policy more vigorously. More closures of other chat forums, or sub-reddits, would follow if they too were abused in the same way, it said. The action has been widely criticised, with some saying it marks a significant policy shift for the site. Many Reddit members responded by flooding the site with images related to the banned forums or directing abusive comments to the site's administrators. Banning behaviour The closures were announced in a post placed on Reddit, saying the sub-reddits had been banned because they had broken community rules on harassment and the forum's volunteer moderators had not taken action to stop the behaviour. The sub-reddits directed abuse towards overweight, black and trans people as well as gamers. The post said Reddit's operators wanted as ""little involvement as possible"" in overseeing what people said to each other on the site. However, they said they would intervene when privacy and free expression were threatened or if people suffered abuse. In a separate explanation, Reddit added that the sub-reddits had not been banned because of the opinions expressed within them. Instead, it said, those forums had been used to recruit gangs of people who had then subjected someone to sustained harassment. And this ""brigading"" had affected the lives of people being picked on, who ""worry for their safety every day, because people from a certain community on Reddit have decided to actually threaten them, online and off, every day"". ""We're banning behaviour, not ideas,"" it said. Other forums that people found distasteful or annoying would not suffer bans unless they too prompted offline action against people, Reddit said. It encouraged Reddit users to report sub-reddits engaged in sustained abuse. The announcement and bans sparked a huge debate on the site, with the main discussion thread garnering almost 25,000 comments. Reddit members who commented said the ban was ""horrible"", ""not well thought out"" and a ""bad business decision"". Others argued that it was better to keep a ""bigoted community"" in a separate sub-reddit because shutting that down would mean the abuse would then spill over into other forums. Commentators pointed out that similar decisions to ban discussions by social news site Digg had started an exodus from that site and ultimately led to its demise.","Social news site Reddit has shut down five of its forums because they were being used to ""harass individuals""."
"During that six-month period, Facebook removed more than three billion fake accounts - more than ever before. More than seven million ""hate speech"" posts were removed, also a record high. For the first time, Facebook also reported how many deleted posts were appealed, and how many were put back online after review. In a call with reporters on Thursday, chief executive Mark Zuckerberg hit back against numerous calls to break up Facebook, arguing its size made it possible to defend against the network's problems. ""I don't think that the remedy of breaking up the company is going to address [the problem],"" he said. ""The success of the company has allowed us to fund these efforts at a massive level. I think the amount of our budget that goes toward our safety systems... I believe is greater than Twitter's whole revenue this year."" Fake accounts Facebook said the rise in the number of deleted fake accounts was because ""bad actors"" were using automated methods to create large numbers of them. But it said it spotted and deleted a majority of them within minutes, before they had any opportunity to ""cause harm"". The social network will now also report how many posts were removed for selling ""regulated goods"" such as drugs and guns. It said it took action on more than one million posts selling guns in the six-month period covered by the report. Prevalence For some types of content, such as child sex abuse imagery, violence and terrorist propaganda, the report estimates how often such content was actually seen by people on Facebook. The report said that out of every 10,000 pieces of content viewed on Facebook: Overall, about 5% of the monthly active users on Facebook were fake accounts. Appeals For the first time, the report reveals that between January and March 2019 more than one million appeals were made after posts were deleted for ""hate speech"". About 150,000 posts that were found not to have broken the hate speech policy were restored during that period. Facebook said the report highlighted ""areas where we could be more open in order to build more accountability and responsiveness to the people who use our platform"".","Facebook has published its latest "" enforcement report "", which details how many posts and accounts it took action on between October 2018 and March 2019."
"By Dave LeeTechnology Reporter Significant marches were held in Germany, Poland and the Netherlands against the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (Acta). Around 200 protesters gathered in central London outside the offices of rights holder representative groups. Demonstrators argued that Acta will limit freedom of speech online. However the agreement's supporters insist it will not alter existing laws, and will instead provide protection for content creators in the face of increasing levels of online piracy. The treaty has to date been signed by 22 EU members, including the UK, but has yet to be ratified by the European Parliament. A debate is due to take place in June. On Friday, Germany delayed signing the agreement in order to, a spokesman said, ""give us time to carry out further discussions"". 'In secret' Saturday's London demonstration was supported by the Open Rights Group, a vocal opponent to the treaty. The group's executive director, Jim Killock, argued that Germany's stance shows Acta negotiations were carried out ""in secret"" by EU ""bureaucrats"". ""Three member states in Europe are now looking like they don't want to sign,"" he told the BBC. ""That shows that politicians are only really starting to look at this now. All of a sudden, the whole thing is breaking down."" Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia have already delayed the process after significant pressure from mostly young people. ""The point today is to say Acta is undemocratic,"" Mr Killock added. ""It's lacked scrutiny, it's setting up dangerous new pressures to censor the internet to remove users and put pressure on [Internet Service Providers] to start policing for copyright."" More demonstrations were held in other UK cities, including Edinburgh and Glasgow. Anonymous hackers The anti-Acta movement has also been widely adopted by members of the Anonymous activist collective, which has claimed responsibility for putting high-profile government websites out of action, including that of the Polish prime minister. Speaking at the London protest Loz Kaye, leader of the Pirate Party UK, dismissed worries that aligning closely with Anonymous - some of whose members have carried out various illegal activities online - was harmful to their cause. ""What we've seen is a whole wave of people coming out on the streets right across Europe,"" he told the BBC. ""Some people have been called extreme, but equally, Amnesty International, Médecins Sans Frontières have spoken out. Even The Economist, which is hardly radical, has described the treaty as potentially draconian."" 'Greater transparency' The BBC contacted several key rights holder representatives prior to the demonstration - all of which declined to comment. The UK's Intellectual Property Office has maintained that Acta ""should not"" mean new laws relating to internet use. In a statement, Baroness Wilcox, parliamentary under-secretary for Business, Innovation and Skills, told the BBC: ""It was important for the UK to be a signatory of Acta as it will set an international standard for tackling large-scale infringements of [intellectual property rights], through the creation of common enforcement standards and more effective international cooperation. ""During the negotiations, we continually pushed for greater transparency as we believed that this would have led to a better understanding of the agreement by the public.""",Thousands of people have taken part in co-ordinated protests across Europe in opposition to a controversial anti-piracy agreement.
"Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent@BBCRoryCJon Twitter The two counties are the latest to announce how they'll spend their share of the £530m superfast rural broadband fund that the government announced back in 2010. But behind the excitable press release, there's growing dismay about the whole process of delivering fast broadband to rural areas, with the word ""shambles"" making a frequent appearance. People in areas promised a share of the superfast future are growing impatient with the lack of progress. Peter Green, who lives in the community of Eggesford in Devon, is typical. He got in touch to tell me of the frustrations of trying to run a holiday cottage business on a 500Kbps broadband connection - ""We tried to upload videos but it was pointless"" - and his fruitless efforts to find out just when the Connecting Devon and Somerset organisation might take his village into the 21st Century. A contract with BT was signed earlier this year, but he's still no clearer as to when or if that will help him. Here's the charge sheet against the government's efforts: You can see why rural broadband campaigners might be confused about the government's timetable. Back in 2009, the Labour government promised that everyone would get a minimum 2Mbps by 2012. But when the coalition government arrived, Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt said that wasn't good enough. He scrapped the 2012 target, and instead promised that Britain would have the best superfast broadband network in Europe - by 2015. What the market could not deliver - the final third of the country - would be hooked up thanks to that £530m fund from the licence fee, to be administered by a body called BDUK. But, as Mr Green in Devon and many others elsewhere have found, that timetable has now slipped. The process of putting each county's service out to tender has been painfully slow - 16 out of the 41 designated areas have yet to appoint a contractor - and many of the projects won't be completed until 2016. Whose fault is this? BDUK? The councils? BT? They all point the finger at the EU for investigating whether the government cash constituted state aid, but you might ask whether that could not have been foreseen. There also seems to have been far too much complexity in the bidding process. When I contacted Keri Denton, the Devon County Council executive who runs Connecting Devon and Somerset, she insisted that everything was now on schedule since the contract with BT was signed in January. Work on planning the rollout was in full swing, examining every duct, lifting every manhole, to calculate how far the fast network would stretch. I wasn't clear why some of that work could not have begun back in 2010 when the government funding was first announced, but she insisted that wasn't possible while the procurement process was ongoing. ""We would share that frustration,"" she said when I told her how painful it all looked to those waiting for the network. But she maintained that the end result would be a ""damned good deal"" for the councils, and for residents. BT, not surprisingly, agrees with that. The company insists that Britain is still on track to hit that 2015 target of the best superfast broadband in Europe - even if many of the rural projects won't be complete by then. Bill Murphy, the man running the operation, says there were other firms competing for some of the contracts in the early stages but ""they all found it very difficult to make a case"". When I put it to him that it might have been better and faster to have central government just hand the whole thing to BT from the start, with tight regulation, he disagreed. ""It is a long process, it does cost money to procure things locally, but the fact of the matter is that the only way you're going to get local buy-in is to do it locally."" It is the Department of Culture, Media and Sport which is getting most of the blame. It always looked strange that a department with little experience in this field should be in charge of such a major infrastructure project. Now it seems the Treasury agrees - a report on government infrastructure projects by the Commercial Secretary Lord Deighton is thought to be critical of BDUK, recommending a shake-up. Even Maria Miller, the current Culture Secretary, seems keen to distance herself from the work of her predecessor in this area. I understand that she feels now is the time, as the procurement process nears its conclusion, to bring in some more commercial expertise to BDUK, rather than leaving the civil servants in charge. In the meantime, Mr Green is still waiting to hear when his village will move out of the slow lane. ""We've been waiting years to get anything more than 500k and there's a total lack of information."" He points out that council taxpayers are also contributing to the scheme to the tune of more than £20m. ""It's a lot of money locally and we should be seeing something from it. We hear that broadband speeds are going up nationally but that's in the towns. In the rural areas we are stuck where we are."" Later this week there should be more news, both nationally and locally, on the progress of the superfast broadband project. But that ambition of showing the rest of Europe how to do it by 2015 now looks more challenging than ever.","An exciting press release landed in my inbox this week: ""Superfast Broadband One Step Closer For Thousands More Hertfordshire and Buckinghamshire Homes and Businesses."" This new technology could do for Buckinghamshire ""what the railways did for the Victorians"", promised the council leader quoted within."
"By Leo KelionTechnology reporter The Z30 features a 5in (12.7cm) screen and a relatively large battery, which, the company says, should last more than two days between charges. It is the first product to be released by the Canadian company since it announced last month that it was considering putting itself up for sale. Some analysts have suggested a deal could result in its handset division being shut down. They say the company's patents, software and cash reserves could make it worth about $5bn (£3.1bn). However, they add the hardware unit itself has ""negative value"" and any suitor might wish to do a deal in which they did not have to acquire it. ""Why would you want to own a platform that is obviously in decline?"" asked Colin Gillis, director of research at investment advisers BGC Financial. ""Android is clearly number one, Apple's iOS is number two, and now Windows Phone is number three. ""Blackberry's hardware and operating system themselves are fine, but there's not much more beyond that - it's not a meaningful platform."" App store gaps According to market-research company IDC, Blackberry accounted for 9.3% of all smartphones shipped to the UK during the first half of the year, thanks in part to interest generated by the launch of its new operating system BB10. But its position elsewhere is much weaker. The company only accounted for 1.7% of all smartphones shipped to the US and 0.1% to China, the world's biggest markets, during the same period, according to IDC. The announcement of the new handset indicates the company wish to emulate the several Android manufacturers who have found success with larger screens. Samsung and Sony are among the companies that have recently unveiled new so-called ""phablets"". But Blackberry faces the problem that its app store is still missing several of the big-name programs available for Google's operating system. One expert warned that the current uncertainty over its future might discourage software writers from filling in those gaps. ""The rumours might affect developers and that in turn might affect consumers - even if many are not aware of the problems that Blackberry currently finds itself in,"" said Tony Cripps, principal analyst at the telecoms consultancy Ovum. ""The same issue really surrounds a 5in Blackberry device as their other smaller ones. ""By going it alone as far as its platform and ecosystem strategy is concerned, it's pretty much left itself at great risk of not putting together an offering that is very appealing either to the end user or the third-party developers."" System update Blackberry said the Z30 would be released in the UK and Middle East next week, ahead of other regions. It is also releasing an update to its operating system - taking it to version 10.2 - which it said offered ""hundreds of refinements plus many new features"". These include the ability to preview and respond to messages without having to switch out of whatever app the owner is using, and the introduction of a ""priority hub"" that groups together information and emails that the device judges to be most important to the user. The firm said that the update should be available to owners of its existing Z10 and Q10 devices from mid-October.",Blackberry has announced its biggest smartphone to date.
"By Sam SheadTechnology reporter The console, which can be connected to a TV or used on the move, was released in the UK in March 2017. In China, computer games must be approved by the authorities before they can be sold to the public. Regulators there changed the way they vet games in February as part of an effort to clear a backlog. In order to sell the Switch in China, Nintendo has partnered with Chinese tech giant Tencent. It is being sold for 2,099 yuan (£200). Nintendo hopes to launch Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and Mario Odyssey in China soon, but has yet to get the green light. The company said it aims to offer between 10 and 20 first-party games for the Switch in China by the end of 2020. Thousands of gamers have discussed the machines's arrival on the Chinese social network Weibo, according to BBC Monitoring's Kerry Allen. Under the hashtag #NintendoSwitchHasArrivedInTheCountry, players have complained or made jokes about the country's strict gaming regulations. Users who have bought the console say there are several Nintendo games displayed on the menu, but only one is actually playable. They have also noted that it is only possible to buy games with Tencent's WeChat Pay at present, and that the simplified-Chinese language menus are hard for some to understand. China's war on games China had a decade-long ban on games consoles prior to 2014. Since then, the country has approved Microsoft's Xbox One and Sony's PlayStation 4 among others, and has slowly been signing off games for the platforms. However, regulators occasionally stop granting approvals for new games for months on end. Piers Harding-Rolls, a games analyst at IHS Markit, told the BBC that there was a large market for imported games as a result. ""Although it launches with one official authorised game, users are aware they can play other games on their Switches,"" he added. ""There's a big grey market for the Switch in China. They've been selling it since the Western launch."" IHS Markit forecasts about 100,000 Switch units will be sold in China by the end of 2019.","The Nintendo Switch has finally gone on sale in China, but Super Smash Bros is the only official Nintendo game available."
"Mr Bernstein was a well-known and loved e-sports player and had 960,000 followers on streaming site Twitch. His brother Gary Bernstein confirmed that Reckful had taken his own life, aged 31. Twitch said Reckful was a ""streaming pioneer"" and that it was ""devastated"" to hear of his death. Mr Bernstein had built his following in part by playing World Of Warcraft. When his death was reported on Thursday evening, fans held virtual memorials inside the game. Before his death, he had been working to create his own video game, called Everland. In January, he shared a video on YouTube in which he talked about his own struggle with depression and said he had lost one of his brothers to suicide. ""Byron was someone who talked about his struggles to help make room for others to the same,"" Twitch said in a statement. ""As we process this loss, we have to recognise that the stigma around mental health and treatment often prevents people from seeking and getting the help they need."" Paying respects by Steffan Powell, Radio 1 Newsbeat gaming reporter Never before has an event organised organically by gamers seen so many of the Mages, Warlocks and Warriors of Azeroth gather together in such numbers. Pictures of World of Warcraft players meeting in the game's central cathedral to pay their respects, in record numbers, show just how much the death of Reckful has affected people across the world. Not all had followed his journey from top-ranked player to game developer, but they came in any case - such was his impact on World of Warcraft and its community. For some, this was also a way to raise awareness of the stigma surrounding mental health. Reckful had openly discussed his personal struggles on his platform. Many of those kneeling to remember him in Stormwind Cathedral last night will have related to his experience. Today, many prominent members of the gaming community - from streamers to senior bosses at Twitch - are talking about how people need to be kinder to each other, and questioning what more needs to done to help people with their mental health. The games industry has been doing a lot of soul-searching recently, with many coming forward to share their experiences of sexual harassment at events and online. That soul-searching will no doubt continue, now with an added focus on mental health, as gaming communities figure out how to be a safer and more inclusive place. His former partner, a gamer known as Becca, said - in a blog post - that Reckful was ""amazing"". ""We need better support for those with mental needs. I remember Byron telling me how traumatised he was when he had the authorities called on him for being at risk of suicide,"" she wrote. ""Anyone that knew him knew how much it scared and affected him. This can't be how people feel about the places that should be keeping them safe.""","Tributes have been paid to video games streamer Byron Bernstein, known as Reckful, who died on Thursday."
"By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor Ofcom reported that just over half of parents it surveyed said they avoided what it termed ""sharenting"" altogether. A desire to protect the privacy of under-18s was the most commonly given reason, it said. But about one in five parents said they posted such images at least once a month, the regulator added. The figures are contained in the organisation's annual Communications Market Report. It is based on an online survey of 1,000 adults carried out in April by YouGov. Ofcom suggested that posting family videos and photos to social media had become a ""Marmite issue"" - a reference to the opinion-splitting food spread. ""Parents are really divided about whether it's sensible to share photos of their children online,"" Ofcom's consumer group director Lindsey Fussell told the BBC. ""The good news is that of those who do share, over 80% feel very confident about restricting who can see those photos... to friends and family, for example."" Of the abstainers, 87% said their offspring's lives should remain private, and 38% said their children would not want them to upload the material. But 52% of the sharers said their children were happy for photos and videos of themselves to be online, and only 15% had concerns about what their children might think when they grew up. Is too much TV making you tired? Most of those questioned acknowledged that they tended to accept social media and messaging apps' terms and conditions without reading them, and half acknowledged it was not always easy to erase imagery from the net once it had been uploaded. In light of the findings, the NSPCC children's charity urged parents to carefully consider the issues involved. ""Each time a photo or video is uploaded, it creates a digital footprint of a child which can follow them into adult life,"" said a spokeswoman. ""It is always important to ask a child for their permission before posting photos or videos of them. ""For very young children, think about whether they would be happy for you to post or if it will embarrass them. If you aren't sure, it's best not to post."" Selfie culture The study also examined the care people took over the images they upload of themselves. On average, it said, respondents took six photos of themselves for every selfie that they posted. Moreover, it said, the popularity of filters in Instagram, Snapchat and Facebook as well as a plethora of face-enhancement apps had helped encourage nearly half of all selfie-snappers to take over a minute to edit the pictures before posting them. The report also pointed to a disconnect between how people felt about their own self-portraits and what they thought about others': 61% of respondents said their own images were an accurate reflection of themselves, but 74% said at times other people's presented ""rose tinted"" versions of their lives. Facebook v YouTube The wide-ranging report also indicated that while there might be more Britons on YouTube (42 million) than Facebook (39.7 million), the latter appears to be more addictive. In the summer of 2016, the watchdog released a smartphone-tracking app of its own for Android devices and analysed the data generated for 1,200 volunteers. It revealed that on average the participants used Facebook's app 11.7 times a day. By contrast, the figure for YouTube was 2.6 times. Other results from the report include:","Parents are divided about whether it is right to post photos of one's children to social media, according to a study by the UK's communications watchdog."
"Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News@gordoncoreraon Twitter For more than three decades, hackers linked to Moscow are believed to have tried to steal US secrets online. Those breaches of US systems have done much to define how America sees cyber-space, and how it defends itself. And they have learnt it is not always possible to predict, or stop, Moscow's efforts. 1) Cuckoo's Egg The first person to trail foreign hackers taking sensitive US data was not a spy, but an astronomer who was worried about an unpaid $0.75. Cliff Stoll looked after the computer networks at his lab. In 1986, he noticed someone logging in to use the computer without paying. In the coming months, he would follow their trail and observe the unknown party searching for military-related data. In his book, Cuckoo's Egg, Stoll reveals how he eventually traced the login to a group of hackers in Germany, who had sold their access to the KGB, Moscow's intelligence service. It led Stoll to involve America's intelligence community. As the first country to move information online, Stoll's discovery was the first indication that the US was going to be a lucrative target for foreign hackers. 2) Moonlight Maze A decade later, in the mid 1990s, the first major cyber-espionage campaign conducted by a state intelligence agency was uncovered. Codenamed Moonlight Maze, some of the details remain classified. But this was a group of high-end hackers working ""low and slow"" to steal US military secrets through a backdoor. The hackers took vast amounts of information. And, for the first time, defence officials also feared they might leave something behind - to sabotage their systems. US investigators were confident they knew who was behind it. The attackers worked 08:00 to 17:00 Moscow time (but never on a Russian holiday) and Russian language was found in the code. Moscow denied everything, and stalled the investigation. Among those who worked on the investigation was Kevin Mandia - currently chief executive of security firm FireEye. Those involved say it was the first time they understood the sophistication of their adversary, believed to be a successor organisation to the KGB. 3) Buckshot Yankee Someone picked up something they should not have done and put it in a computer. A familiar story these days maybe - but, in 2008, the rogue USB stick loaded with malware - possibly found in a car park on a military base overseas - rocked Washington. It allowed hackers to penetrate classified US military systems which were supposed to be kept offline. It took four months for an analyst to spot the breach at US Central Command and the clear-up, codenamed Buckshot Yankee, took even longer. It was linked to the same group that was behind Moonlight Maze. The shock led directly to the creation of US Cyber Command within the Pentagon - a team set up to protect sensitive networks, but also to hunt adversaries online. 4) The Democrats In the subsequent years, China began to receive more focus - particularly with regard to stealing commercial secrets. But Russia had not gone away. During the 2016 US presidential election, it turned out that not one, but two, Russian intelligence service hacking teams were inside the Democratic party. The team from the foreign intelligence agency, the SVR, stayed undercover - but the military intelligence team from the GRU - Fancy Bear - had a different plan in mind. It leaked the material it stole, causing disruption and, arguably, playing a role in shifting the course of the election. The problem was no one had been prepared for this kind of ""information operation"". This time round, in the 2020 presidential election, companies and officials were on their guard for election interference from Russia. But what they didn't realise was that old-fashioned espionage was carrying on unnoticed - with Russian intelligence again believed to be the culprit. Once more Moscow has denied any role. 5) Sunburst The exact impact of the Sunburst breach, through the company SolarWinds, is not yet clear. Nonetheless, federal officials talk of a ""grave risk"" because of the sheer scale of possible compromise of departments, companies and organisations. It is not ""espionage as usual"", Microsoft President Brad Smith argues. But others disagree, calling it pretty much routine espionage. They add that the US is not just the victim, but also the perpetrator of these type of hacks. The Snowden revelations of 2013 showed the US (and UK) were more than capable of targeting other countries' secrets by compromising hardware and software from reputable firms - in a way that is not that different to this latest breach. The troubling question this hack may raise, though, is that - after more than 30 years of experience and massive investment - why did it still take so long to spot and stop the breach? The answer? In cyberspace the attacker normally has the advantage in finding a new way in before the defender can close off that gap. And as long as there are secrets online, the most capable spies - especially those in Russia - will be out to steal them.","The latest hack, allegedly by Russia , is a reminder that Moscow is America's oldest adversary in cyber-space."
"By Zoe KleinmanTechnology reporter, BBC News The lower capacity battery charged by 68% in two minutes - but is not big enough to run a smartphone for long. The higher capacity one charged by 48% in five minutes and could provide up to 10 hours of talk time, the firm said. Current battery life is a significant limiting factor in the performance of portable devices. Many tech firms and entrepreneurs are researching the issue. In March, Samsung announced that the batteries in its new Galaxy S6 handsets could power up to four hours of usage after a 10-minute charge. Israeli start-up Storedot unveiled a fast-charging device at the beginning of the year which it hopes will eventually be able to charge any smartphone battery in under one minute. Scientists are also researching alternative battery materials to the traditional lithium-ion such as aluminium and graphene. Huawei says it used heteroatoms - atoms which are not carbon or hydrogen - which the firm claims can increase charging speeds without affecting the battery's overall lifespan. ""Everyone in the world - consumers and all the manufacturers - would benefit from some unforeseen breakthrough in battery chemistry technology,"" Motorola president Rick Osterloh told the BBC in July. ""At the moment everyone is getting interesting incremental benefits from changes in lithium-ion batteries but fundamentally there hasn't been a Moore's Law type curve for battery improvements and I think that would be something everyone would benefit [from]."" Moore's Law, which became the bedrock for the computer processor industry, relates to the rate at which processor speeds increase - roughly doubling every two years.","Chinese tech giant Huawei has unveiled two prototype removable lithium-ion batteries that can recharge in minutes, using a bespoke charger."
"By David MeyerTechnology reporter The scheme was outlined at the Chaos Communication Congress in Berlin. The project's organisers said the Hackerspace Global Grid will also involve developing a grid of ground stations to track and communicate with the satellites. Longer term they hope to help put an amateur astronaut on the moon. Hobbyists have already put a few small satellites into orbit - usually only for brief periods of time - but tracking the devices has proved difficult for low-budget projects. The hacker activist Nick Farr first put out calls for people to contribute to the project in August. He said that the increasing threat of internet censorship had motivated the project. ""The first goal is an uncensorable internet in space. Let's take the internet out of the control of terrestrial entities,"" Mr Farr said. He cited the proposedStop Online Piracy Act (Sopa)in the United States as an example of the kind of threat facing online freedom. If passed, the act would allow for some sites to be blocked on copyright grounds. Beyond balloons Although space missions have been the preserve of national agencies and large companies, amateur enthusiasts have launched objects into the heavens. High-altitude balloons have also been used to place cameras and other equipment into what is termed ""near space"". The balloons can linger for extended amounts of time - but are not suitable for satellites. The amateur radio satellite Arissat-1 was deployed into low earth orbit last year via a spacewalk by two Russian cosmonauts from the International Space Station as part of an educational project. Students and academics have also launched other objects by piggybacking official rocket launches. However, these devices have often proved tricky to pinpoint precisely from the ground. According to Armin Bauer, a 26-year-old enthusiast from Stuttgart who is working on theHackerspace Global Grid, this is largely due to lack of funding. ""Professionals can track satellites from ground stations, but usually they don't have to because, if you pay a large sum [to send the satellite up on a rocket], they put it in an exact place,"" Mr Bauer said. In the long run, a wider hacker aerospace project aims to put an amateur astronaut onto the moon within the next 23 years. ""It is very ambitious so we said let's try something smaller first,"" Mr Bauer added. Ground network The Berlin conference was the latest meeting held by the Chaos Computer Club, a decades-old German hacker group that has proven influential not only for those interested in exploiting or improving computer security, but also for people who enjoy tinkering with hardware and software. When Mr Farr called for contributions to Hackerspace, Mr Bauer and others decided to concentrate on the communications infrastructure aspect of the scheme. He and his teammates are working on their part of the project together withConstellation, an existing German aerospace research initiativethat mostly consists of interlinked student projects. In the open-source spirit of Hackerspace, Mr Bauer and some friends came up with the idea of a distributed network of low-cost ground stations that can be bought or built by individuals. Used together in a global network, these stations would be able to pinpoint satellites at any given time, while also making it easier and more reliable for fast-moving satellites to send data back to earth. ""It's kind of a reverse GPS,"" Mr Bauer said. ""GPS uses satellites to calculate where we are, and this tells us where the satellites are. We would use GPS co-ordinates but also improve on them by using fixed sites in precisely-known locations."" Mr Bauer said the team would have three prototype ground stations in place in the first half of 2012, and hoped to give away some working models at the next Chaos Communication Congress in a year's time. They would also sell the devices on a non-profit basis. ""We're aiming for 100 euros (£84) per ground station. That is the amount people tell us they would be willing to spend,"" Mr Bauer added. Complications Experts say the satellite project is feasible, but could be restricted by technical limitations. ""Low earth orbit satellites such as have been launched by amateurs so far, do not stay in a single place but rather orbit, typically every 90 minutes,"" said Prof Alan Woodward from the computing department at the University of Surrey. ""That's not to say they can't be used for communications but obviously only for the relatively brief periods that they are in your view. It's difficult to see how such satellites could be used as a viable communications grid other than in bursts, even if there were a significant number in your constellation."" This problem could be avoided if the hackers managed to put their satellites into geostationary orbits above the equator. This would allow them to match the earth's movement and appear to be motionless when viewed from the ground. However, this would pose a different problem. ""It means that they are so far from earth that there is an appreciable delay on any signal, which can interfere with certain Internet applications,"" Prof Woodward said. ""There is also an interesting legal dimension in that outer space is not governed by the countries over which it floats. So, theoretically it could be a place for illegal communication to thrive. However, the corollary is that any country could take the law into their own hands and disable the satellites."" Need for knowledge Apart from the ground station scheme, other aspects of the Hackerspace project that are being worked on include the development of new electronics that can survive in space, and the launch vehicles that can get them there in the first place. According to Mr Farr, the ""only motive"" of the Hackerspace Global Grid is knowledge. He said many participants are frustrated that no person has been sent past low Earth orbit since the Apollo 17 mission in 1972. ""This [hacker] community can put humanity back in space in a meaningful way,"" Farr said. ""The goal is to get back to where we were in the 1970s. Hackers find it offensive that we've had the technology since before many of us were born and we haven't gone back."" Asked whether some might see negative security implications in the idea of establishing a hacker presence in space, Farr said the only downside would be that ""people might not be able to censor your internet"". ""Hackers are about open information,"" Farr added. ""We believe communication is a human right.""",Computer hackers plan to take the internet beyond the reach of censors by putting their own communication satellites into orbit.
"By Dave LeeTechnology reporter, BBC News For Knight Rider creator Glen Larson, who has died aged 77, he will have at least seen some, if sadly not all, of his imaginations become reality. The show's tagline, uttered over that irresistible theme tune, declares the show ""a shadowy flight into the dangerous world of a man who does not exist"". Like David Hasselhoff's Michael Knight character, much of the technology found under the bonnet of Knight Industries Two Thousand - Knight's car, known simply as Kitt - didn't exist. At least, not in 1982. Here are some of the most memorable - many of which are found in many cars on the road today. Self-driving/Auto collision avoidance Michael Knight normally had a lot on his plate, and so it was generally useful to be able to palm off some simple tasks - like driving - to Kitt. To prevent the obvious pitfall of crashing into things, Kitt would deploy auto collision avoidance technology. The car would scan what was happening around it to make sure it reacted quickly. Twenty years later, auto collision detection technology is a widely implemented safety feature. The European Commission has said that by 2015, all new commercial vehicles should be fitted with devices that could, they hope, dramatically decrease the number of fatalities on European roads. Ford, GM, Toyota and many others are funding huge swathes of research and development in the area. When to see it: Episode 108, Trust Doesn't Rust Anamorphic equaliser Perhaps Kitt's most distinctive feature was the red bar of light that would ebb and flow on the front of the car. Aside from merely looking good, it was actually carrying out an important function - the anamorphic equaliser was described by the programme-makers as a series of ""electronic eyes"". It allowed Kitt, and therefore Knight, to see in X-ray vision or infra-red. Unfortunately, the bar was also thought to be Kitt's weakest point, its Achilles heel, because it was not protected by the car's bulletproof armour. In this regard, modern day technology hasn't quite reached the heights of Kitt - yet. The likes of Mercedes Benz have fitted some of their higher-end vehicles with technology that allows the driver to see better in the dark (other than, obviously, turning on lights). Using infra-red, the road ahead is ""lit up"" in a way that is invisible to humans, but can be interpreted by a computer to give better visibility. Other systems use thermal radiation given off by animals and humans to allow a different way to ""see"" in the dark. When to see it: Throughout the series Homing device If Knight was struggling, and needed Kitt, he could summon the car via a homing beacon hidden in a gold pendant he kept around his neck. Kitt would roar into life and come and rescue him. Today, Google's vision of a future of driverless cars has a similar feature. Instead of a gold pendant, the car is summoned via a person's smartphone. And Google's cars won't exactly rush to your side - with a top speed, for the time being, of 25mph. Much more sensible, but far less cool. When to see it: Episode 218, A Good Knight's Work Medical scanner It's no good Kitt being highly advanced if the man it's supposed to protect is, well, dead. And so one of the first futuristic features we're shown on Knight Rider is Kitt's ability to detect Knight's vital signs. The car can tell if someone riding in it is ""injured, poisoned, undergoing stress or other emotional behaviour"". How did it get this information? Why through the seat of course! Step forward Ford, with its ECG Heart Rate Monitoring Seat. Six embedded sensors are able to monitor vital signs and detect whether a driver is, for example, having a heart attack. If a problem is detected, the chair could activate the car's other safety features - like collision avoidance - to bring the vehicle to a slow stop. When Kitt was given an upgrade for a new series in 2008, it was even able to administer help by pumping out extra oxygen. When to see it: Episode 1, Knight of the Phoenix Electronic jammer Sadly, in the real world, technology isn't always used for the most exciting purpose. Take jamming, for example. With Kitt, Knight used various forms of electromagnetic or microwave jamming to create serious mischief - moving objects, hacking cash machines to spit out money, and taking control of nearby cars. In the real world, however, jamming is more likely to be used by truckers to hide what they're up to. GPS jamming is an increasing concern for traffic authorities the world over - companies use GPS to keep track of where their vehicles are. Drivers, not fond of the monitoring, and sometimes prone to a spot of moonlighting, have been known to use the £30-a-pop jammers to spoof the system. Not to be recommended (it's illegal, and potentially very dangerous). When to see it: Episode 109, Inside Out Hydrogen hybrid Kitt may have been a loud hulk of a machine - but it was at least environmentally-friendly. And what powered Knight's brutal turbo engines? Hydrogen, the zero-emission fuel of choice for today's most popular clean cars. But it didn't just rely on Hydrogen. The car's sophisticated (it's a secret, apparently) engine was able to use a mixture of fuels, including petrol. A hybrid, if you will - just like the Toyota Prius, the car that has become the biggest-selling hybrid globally. Kitt's fuel efficiency was said to be in the region of 65 miles (100km) per gallon. When to see it: Throughout the series Thanks, but no thanks... Not all the innovations in Kitt have found their way to real-life, and nor would you want them too. In one episode, Kitt is able to assess the body shape of Bonnie, one of the main female characters, who was wearing overalls. While in episode 15, we see Knight print out the information he needed, straight from the dashboard. You'd think, these days, he'd just have it on his phone.

"A judge in San Francisco granted the electronics giant a subpoena that would allow it to see a list of IP addresses. The software, used to crack the PS3's operating system, was posted on the website of George Hotz, who is also known as Geohot. Sony is suing Mr Hotz, claiming his hacks breach copyright laws, and could allow users to play pirated games. Court documents, obtained by Wired magazine, show that the company successfully petitioned to obtain IP addresses from the web-hosting company Bluehost. The details could be used to trace the real-world geographical locations of users who accessed George Hotz's website, Geohot.com. However, it may not be Sony's intention to take legal action against those found to have downloaded the software crack. Illicit conduct Sources with knowledge of the case said there was unlikely to be the appetite for a prolonged and expensive series of legal challenges. Rather, the subpoena document suggests that Sony wants to discover the number and location of the downloaders in order to establish jurisdiction in its case against Mr Hotz. ""SCEA [Sony Computer Entertainment America] needs to determine how rampant the access to and use of these circumvention devices has been in California in order to rebut Mr Hotz's suggestion that his illicit conduct was not aimed at the forum state,"" the document reads. The subpoena also grants Sony the right to access information relating to the case from Twitter, Google Blogspot and YouTube. Restraining order The company had previously been granted a restraining order against Mr Hotz, banning him from revealing techniques to manipulate the PlayStation 3's operating system. The 21-year-old, along with a number of other individuals, is charged with violating several copyright-related laws, including the Digital Millennium Copyright Act He is also accused of offences under the United States' Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. Mr Hotz denies that he set out to help software pirates, claiming instead that he was championing the 'home brew' community - users who write their own software for the PS3. Sony has said it is now able to remotely identify users who are running hacked PlayStation 3 consoles and that it will ban persistent offenders from using its online services.",Sony has been given permission to obtain details of people who downloaded files needed to hack the PlayStation 3.
"The Virus Alert system keeps an eye on the websites customers visit to stop them accidentally going to places riddled with viruses. The ICO admonished the ISP when the service was debuted because customers were not told it was going ahead. Talk Talk said the trials would be with customers that have opted in to use it. In a blog posting, Clive Dorsman, managing director of Talk Talk Technology, wrote that trials of the system with a limited number of customers would start in a ""few weeks"". The malware watching service first came to light in early September following a Freedom of Information request to the Information Commissioner to see if it had been notified about the system. In response, Information Commissioner Christopher Graham said he had been in touch with Talk Talk to express his concern that customers were not told they were being enrolled into the system. Some compared the malware watching technology to the controversial ad system Phorm, which planned to target adverts based on a person's browsing habits. Talk Talk defended the security system saying that it did not log browsing habits and only scanned pages people wanted to visit to ensure they did not stray onto sites booby-trapped with malware. In its blog posting, Talk Talk said it talked with ""relevant public bodies"" over the service and had received a lot of feedback about its plans. In a statement the ICO said: ""We have advised Talk Talk on the safeguards which are necessary to comply with the Data Protection Act and the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations."" It warned: ""We expect them to make sure they are effective in practice.""

"In a 1,500-page document, the company laid out its ambitions to ""improve the urban environment"" with a variety of high-tech innovations. Waterfront Toronto, the body that will decide if the bid is successful, has questioned the proposals. Meanwhile, some citizens want the plans to be scrapped entirely. 'Lab rats' The partnership between Sidewalk Labs and Waterfront Toronto was announced in 2017 and the plans to revitalise a disused part of the city was intended to be a model for future urban development. But citizens expressed concerns about becoming ""lab rats"" and questioned Sidewalk Labs's motivations in building a city ""from the internet up"". A group called simply Block Sidewalk held meetings to express growing concern about having a huge technology company making decisions about city life. The group has called a meeting on 3 July to discuss the plans. Sidewalk Labs chief executive Dan Doctoroff remained upbeat about its intentions, saying it wanted to create ""something extraordinary"" on Toronto's eastern waterfront. ""The proposal aims to create the neighbourhood of the future in the right kind of way with people at its centre and with cutting edge technology and forward-thinking urban design,"" he said. 'Different perspective' The Master Innovation and Development Plan outlines a range of innovations - from thermal and advanced energy grids, to factory-based construction of timber buildings, to a dynamic mobility network with heated bike lanes and adaptive traffic lights. But in an open letter, Waterfront Toronto chairman Stephen Diamond's response seemed lukewarm, saying there were key areas where the two organisations had ""very different perspectives"". This included the scale of the plan, which he said was ""much larger"" than the original 12-acre (48,500-sq-m) site, and its proposals to collect and store data, which he said required extra information to ensure they complied with applicable laws. Sidewalk Labs said it had spent 18 months consulting more than 20,000 Toronto citizens.","Sidewalk Labs, a sister company of Google, has published its plans to build a smart city in Toronto, sparking fresh controversy."
"Based at Tesco's Oranmore store, County Galway, the drones will deliver ""small baskets"" of goods to the local area. The drones, supplied by Manna, which already runs medicine delivery trials in Ireland, will launch next month. Flying at 50mph (80km/h), they can deliver up to 4kg (9lb) of shopping - in a cargo cassette lowered from the drone - a mile away in three minutes. Manna had planned a takeaway food delivery trial in March but changed its focus to medicines during the coronavirus pandemic. It now delivers prescriptions and other essential supplies in the town of Moneygall. Noise concerns In 2016, retail giant Amazon made its first commercial drone delivery in the UK - from its fulfilment centre in Cambridge to a local resident, within 13 minutes of the order being placed. And in April 2020, the UK government announced much larger unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) would deliver essential hospital supplies from the mainland to the Isle of Wight. But some drone trials have been opposed by residents who say the aircraft are too noisy and intrusive. And, last year, an Institution of Mechanical Engineers report indicated only a quarter of UK adults supported the idea of drone deliveries, because of safety and noise concerns.",A Tesco drone delivery trial will see small items dropped off at customers' homes within 30 minutes of ordering.
"Dave LeeNorth America technology reporter The company said it was open to emerging technologies but many companies were not acting in ""good faith"" when extolling the virtues buying into virtual currencies. Recently, a wave of new currencies have emerged, seeking to piggyback Bitcoin's huge increase in value. Facebook urged users to report any ads the company's security measures missed. It admitted it would not always catch every ad for a crypto-currency. “We want people to continue to discover and learn about new products and services through Facebook ads without fear of scams or deception,"" wrote Rob Leathern, product management director for Facebook Business. ""That said, there are many companies who are advertising binary options, ICOs and crypto-currencies that are not currently operating in good faith.” US blocks coin offering by 'scam' bank US regulator halts initial coin offering Bitcoin - risky bubble or the future? An ICO - initial coin offering - encourages people to buy into new crypto-currencies before they launch in the hope they are one day worth a lot more money as the coin becomes more popular. Some companies have used ICOs as a way to raise great sums of money, but without the regulatory burden associated with raising cash though more traditional investment channels. Because of this, many ICOs have simply disappeared, with little recourse for the ""investor"" - a loose term, since those who pay into ICOs do not typically get a genuine stake in the new company. Deception worries Using Facebook ads to generate ""buzz"" around a new scheme could be a particularly effective method, especially when paired with celebrity endorsement. Retired boxer Floyd Mayweather was criticised last year for promoting a cryto-currency that later became the target of a lawsuit alleging deception. Mr Mayweather has not been accused personally. Raising money using an ICO has been banned in South Korea and China, and regulators in other countries are warning against getting involved. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) this week said it had seized the assets of a firm that said it had raised $600m in its ICO. Facebook said its new policy was ""intentionally broad"" and would evolve over time. It states: ""Ads must not promote financial products and services that are frequently associated with misleading or deceptive promotional practices, such as binary options, initial coin offerings, or crypto-currency."" Under the new policy, advertising using phrases such as ""New ICO! Buy tokens at a 15% discount NOW!"" or ""Use your retirement funds to buy Bitcoin!"" would not be permitted, Facebook said. For Facebook, the move is the latest attempt to protect the integrity of its advertising platform, which over the past 12 months has been under fire for enabling Russian propaganda and other inappropriate content.",Facebook has said it will block any advertising promoting crypto-currency products and services.
"A study quizzed people at flat earth conferences and found most cited videos viewed on the site as a key influence. They were won over by videos which claimed to amass evidence proving the Earth was not a spherical planet. YouTube needed to do a better job of ensuring visitors get accurate information alongside such videos, said the researcher behind the study. ""There's a lot of helpful information on YouTube but also a lot of misinformation,"" Prof Asheley Landrum from Texas Tech University, who carried out the study, told The Guardian. The algorithms the site used to guide people to topics they might be interested in made it easy to ""end up down the rabbit hole"" of misinformation, said Prof Landrum. ""Believing the Earth is flat is of itself is not necessarily harmful, but it comes packaged with a distrust in institutions and authority more generally,"" she added. The study involved interviews with 30 attendees at two conferences. Questioning revealed YouTube had suggested the flat earth videos after attendees had watched other clips at home about conspiracy theories. Some said they only watched the videos to criticise them but were won over by the arguments being advanced. The results from Prof Landrum's study were presented at the annual meeting of the Association for the Advancement of Science this weekend. Prof Landrum said there was a need for scientists and science advocates to produce their own YouTube videos that answered and debunked the claims of flat earthers and conspiracy theorists. ""The only tool we have to battle misinformation is to try and overwhelm it with better information,"" said Prof Landrum.","YouTube is playing a significant role in convincing some people that the Earth is flat, research suggests."
"Details of what caused the service to be unusable for millions of users prior to Christmas have been posted on the firm's blog. The two events combined to create a cascade of problems that managed to knock out much of the network underpinning the phone service. Skype is assessing how its network is built to stop the problem recurring. Traffic cascade Writing on the Skype blog, Lars Rabbe, chief information officer at the company, said the problems started on 22 December, when some of its servers that handle instant messaging started getting overloaded. This meant that the responses they sent to Windows machines running Skype were slightly delayed. Unfortunately, a bug in one version of Skype for Windows meant this delay caused the program to crash. About 50% of all Skype users ran the buggy 5.0.0.152 version of the software, said Mr Rabbe. This caused problems for Skype because of the way the network supporting it is organised. Some of the data travelling round Skype's network are passed through all those machines logged on to the service. Those participating machines act as what Skype calls ""supernodes"" and carry out some of the administrative tasks of the global network and help to ensure calls get through. With a huge number of these machines offline because of the crash, the rest of the network quickly became overloaded. Mr Rabbe wrote that the disappearance of the supernodes meant the remaining ones were swamped by traffic. ""The initial crashes happened just before our usual daily peak-hour and very shortly after the initial crash,"" wrote Mr Rabbe, ""which resulted in traffic to the supernodes that was about 100 times what would normally be expected at that time of day."" Traffic levels were so high that they blew through the safe operating specifications supernodes usually use. As a result, more supernodes shut down. Compensation offer The ""confluence of events"", said Mr Rabbe, led to Skype being offline for about 24 hours as engineers put in place hundreds of dedicated supernodes and gradually brought the service back to life. To ensure the outage does not happen again, Mr Rabbe said Skype would look at its update policy, to see if it should automatically move users to newer versions of its software. A version of Skype for Windows that is free of the bug already exists, but is not automatically given to users. It said it would also look at its network to improve capacity and get on with an investment programme that would boost this resilience. Mr Rabbe apologised again on behalf of the company and added: ""We know that we fell short in both fulfilling your expectations and communicating with you during this incident."" Skype has offered compensation to customers in the form of vouchers for pre-pay users and a free week of service for subscribers.",Server overloads and a bug in Skype for Windows caused the two-day outage for the net phone firm.
"Apple and Amazon have both responded publicly to claims made by Bloomberg Businessweek which described the cyber-attack. ""There is no truth to these claims,"" said Apple's statement. The UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) said it had ""no reason to doubt"" Apple and Amazon's assessments. Bloomberg has yet to respond to a BBC request for a comment about the repeated denials from Apple and others. Earlier it said: ""We stand by our story and are confident in our reporting and sources."" Full disclosure Published on 4 October, Bloomberg's story alleges that Chinese spies managed to insert chips on servers made in China that could be activated once the machines were plugged in overseas. The servers were manufactured for US firm Super Micro Computer Inc. The story suggested that Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Apple were among 30 companies, as well as government agencies and departments, that used the suspect servers. Shares in Chinese tech firms including Lenovo and ZTE fell sharply following the publication of the Bloomberg report. The news agency's story, which Bloomberg said resulted from a 12-month investigation, relied on unnamed and unidentified sources which, it said, included insiders at both Amazon and Apple. Bloomberg linked to the denials given to it by the tech firms and Super Micro Computer when it approached them with its evidence. Now Apple has published its statement in full on its media site saying it had ""repeatedly explained"" to Bloomberg reporters that they were wrong. Apple said it had conducted ""rigorous internal investigations"" based on the evidence given to it by Bloomberg reporters and had found ""absolutely no evidence"" to support their claims. It said: ""On this we can be very clear: Apple has never found malicious chips, 'hardware manipulations' or vulnerabilities purposely planted in any server."" It added that it was not operating under any ""gag order"" or any other confidentiality restriction that stopped it sharing information. Amazon published a blog that also said the spy chip story was ""untrue"" saying it had never found ""modified hardware or malicious chips"" on its systems. The NCSC responded to questions about the alleged spy chip attack by saying it was aware of media reports but had ""no reason to doubt the detailed assessments made by AWS (Amazon Web Services) and Apple"". It urged anyone with ""credible intelligence"" about the allegations to get in touch.",A report alleging that Apple and Amazon had data stolen by Chinese spies has been strongly disputed by both tech firms.
"James Comey spoke to US politicians as the war of words between the FBI and Apple intensified. The FBI has asked Apple to unlock the iPhone of Syed Rizwan Farook who killed 14 people in December 2015. Apple has refused, saying the protection of personal data was ""incredibly important"". New world ""This is the hardest question I have seen in government and it's going to require negotiation and conversation,"" Mr Comey told the House Intelligence Committee. ""I love encryption, I love privacy, and when I hear corporations saying we're going to take you to a world where no one can look at your stuff, part of me thinks that's great,"" he said. However, he added, law enforcement saved lives, rescued children and prevented terror attacks using search warrants that gave it access to information on mobile phones. ""We are going to move to a world where that is not possible anymore,"" he said. ""The world will not end but it will be a different world than where we are today and where we were in 2014."" People needed to understand ""the costs associated with moving to a world of universal strong encryption"", he added. Mr Comey said it should be left to Congress and others to decide about what counted as reasonable law enforcement access to encrypted data. He also said if Apple did unlock the phone it was ""unlikely to be a trailblazer"" for many future cases. The speed with which the technology in smartphones changes meant any defects Apple exploited to get at data would not be present in newer gadgets. Despite this, he added that it would be ""instructive"" for other courts. At another hearing Microsoft President Brad Smith said it would be filing an amicus brief to support Apple's position. Mr Smith told a House Judiciary Committee that Microsoft ""wholeheartedly"" supported Apple on the issue of resisting calls to unlock the phone. Earlier this week Microsoft founder Bill Gates said the row should prompt a debate about the access that law enforcement gets to data in terror investigations. The row between Apple and the FBI over the phone of Farook blew up last week when the bureau asked the electronics firm for help to unlock the smartphone. Farook and his wife Tashfeen Malik killed 14 people and wounded 22 others during the attack in San Bernadino. So far, Apple has refused to unlock the phone. In an interview aired yesterday with US TV network ABC, Apple boss Tim Cook said the FBI was asking it to make ""the software equivalent of cancer"". He added: ""Some things are hard and some things are right. And some things are both. This is one of those things."" Apple has until 26 February to formally respond to the FBI order.","The FBI director has said the row over access to a dead murderer's iPhone was the ""hardest question"" he had tackled in his job."
"Dave LeeNorth America technology reporter It's really rather good, I think. Paul Wedgwood, chief executive of games studio Splash Damage, was highlighting what he sees as an unquestionable absurdity: women are sometimes portrayed in games ludicrously and inappropriately dressed for the situation they are in - as if heaving cleavage was a more effective defence than body armour. ""We must not forget that we are entertainment,"" he added. ""There's nothing wrong with sexualising men or women, because that is called for in certain narratives and with certain casts. ""Just rarely is it necessary when someone is holding an AK-47."" Splash Damage, based in Bromley, UK, is a independent games studio that has worked on all manner of what you might consider to be uber-masculine titles. Games like Doom, Wolfenstein and Gears of War. He and his colleagues were at the E3 games expo to promote Dirty Bomb, a first-person shooter in which you take control of a large cast of mercenaries deployed to a London ravaged by severe radiation. It's a game that has been quietly complimented on its portrayal of women. They're strong. They're fearsome. They're sexy. And they're dressed… here's the breakthrough... like soldiers. Proactive protagonists Mr Wedgwood makes it seem so simple. But we can't get away - and we've been writing about it for years - from gaming's diversity issue, one that evolves constantly as new titles and trends emerge. Two years ago at this event, there was considerable uproar when it was revealed that the new Assassin's Creed title would feature four playable characters, but not a single woman. Developer Ubisoft didn't help the matter by saying that plans for a female character were shelved as developers would have to ""re-do a lot of animation"". Two years on, this year's E3 should have, in theory, given us some idea whether the upset over Assassin's Creed - as well as a more general, widespread call for change - led to a greater effort from big publishers to reassess their direction. Two years is ample lead time to conceive, design and develop a game that would be ready for viewing at E3 2016. By some counts, there are fewer playable female characters in this year's new titles. But that's maybe not a fair reflection. Both Sony and Microsoft rolled out big new titles with prominent female characters. Recore (Xbox One) features Joule Adams, an agile heroine who calls upon several robotic sidekicks - named Mack, Seth and Duncan - to explore a mysterious, isolated world. In Horizon: New Dawn (PlayStation 4), you play Aloy. She finds herself up against dinosaur-like robots with not much more than a bow, arrow and knife. And Mass Effect: Andromeda (cross platform) appears to have a female character as the default, though you can play as a male if you wish. Club play The key point from the E3 games line-up is that the female character-led games aren't niche or quirky efforts, but blockbuster titles with huge budgets. But it would be naive to say the issue of diversity in gaming starts and ends with a different line-up of characters. Improving diversity in ""games"" is different from improving diversity in ""gaming"". At this year's E3, Microsoft launched Gaming for Everyone, a scheme that hopes to group gamers by the type of experience they are looking for - an attempt to provide an alternative to the sometimes harsh discourse that many might find uncomfortable or maybe just irritating. ""One of our ideas is around looking for groups or clubs on Xbox Live,"" explained Letty Cherry, Xbox's head of PR. ""It's giving people all of the different choices to create games the same way that they play them. Do they feel it's a safe environment? Do they feel it's a comfortable environment? ""If a woman wants to play a game and she only wants to play with other females, great. We have so many different ways of having choice. We're not trying to ostracise anyone."" Fifa's story The debate around diversity in gaming tends to initially gravitate towards issues around gender, but it of course can also be about race, ethnicity and sexuality. Progress with race can perhaps be best seen in EA's latest incarnation of its Fifa football series. In Fifa 17, you can play a story mode in which you control a promising young, black footballer from Clapham, London. Meanwhile, the new instalment of action game Watch Dogs will also feature a black lead character - Marcus Holloway, a young hacker from Oakland, California. But while there is a thriving lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) gaming community, games are often lacking in openly gay prominent, playable characters that move past stereotypes. ""We are working on it,"" adds Microsoft's Ms Cherry. ""I think there is way more we could be doing. We are climbing a mountain and we have many more steps. ""The industry has tonnes of work to do to make it more welcoming for everyone.""

"The beak, made of medical-grade titanium, replaces the loggerhead turtle's jaws, half of which were sheared off in the accident. Detailed scans of the injured creature's head were used to generate the design of the prosthetic beak. If the prosthetic is not rejected by the turtle, the animal will be returned to the sea shortly. The 45kg (99lb) creature was taken to the sea turtle Research, Rescue and Rehabilitation centre at Pamukkale University in Denizli, Turkey soon after being found badly injured at sea. Initially staff at the centre nursed it back to health by feeding it by hand but realised another solution was needed if the turtle was ever going to be able to fend for itself. The rehabilitation centre contacted Turkish company BTech Innovation, known for custom-making medical prosthetics and implants for humans, to see if it could help. BTech used CT scans taken by vets to produce a design that fitted perfectly to the injury site and restored the turtle's ability to feed. The turtle, named Akut-3, is currently convalescing at the recovery centre to ensure that it has adapted to its metal jaw. The animal is not the only reptile to have benefitted from 3D printing recently. In March, a tortoise in Denver was made a customised prosthetic plastic shell by a student at Colorado Technical University, after her original one had deteriorated due to a poor diet.",A 3D-printed beak has been fitted to a sea turtle injured by a collision with a boat's propeller.
"Dave LeeNorth America technology reporter And as competitors such as Google and Apple try to catch up in the home, Amazon is pushing into a new market with Alexa for Business. Office workers will be able to use the firm's Echo smart speakers to set up meetings with colleagues, book conference rooms and other basic tasks. But the critical question isn't whether the technology works, but whether people will trust it in a business setting. ""Without a doubt privacy and security is the number one issue,"" said Geoff Blaber, analyst at CCS Insight. ""Arguably that’s more important than the functionality."" Companies will undoubtedly be cautious about putting Alexa into meeting rooms and offices where sensitive information is being discussed. Echos are always listening, and while Amazon says they don't collect information until activated with the ""Alexa"" wake word, there are times when this happens by accident. Furthermore, the firm stores recordings in order to make its cloud-based service ""smarter"". And it has suggested that in the future it might share transcripts with third-party developers looking to make apps - known as ""skills"" - for the platform. So, to help overcome any nerves, Mr Blaber said it made sense for Alexa to start with mundane office tasks, such as ordering more printer paper, before anything too adventurous. Specific uses At AWS Re:invent, Amazon's annual cloud computing conference, the firm said it was working with major enterprise software companies, including Concur - which handles a lot of travel and expenses for businesses - and Salesforce. Adopters will also be able to create their own customised skills. A typical example might be to provide directions around a building, or to answer questions about the business. ""It will begin with very specific use cases and then build from there,"" said Mr Blaber. He added that partnerships with car-makers, fridge manufactures and others meant that Alexa could ultimately serve users throughout their day. ""The stronger the position, the more it can start to weave those parts together - connect your office life, your home life, your daily commute."" With an estimated 11 million Alexa devices already sold, bringing the system into the workplace has always been a logical next step. ""Not only did they launch first, but the investment that Amazon is making in Alexa is unparalleled at the moment,"" said Mr Blaber. ""Five thousand employees working on Alexa - I think it’s borne out of the fact they don’t have a position in mobile phones.""",The Alexa voice assistant has been Amazon's remarkable runaway hit this past year.
"The new feature called ""fleets"" is similar to vanishing posts on Snapchat and Instagram Stories. The changes prompted the hashtag #RIPTwitter to trend as users complained the new feature would make the micro-blogging site too similar to other social media platforms. So far Twitter is only testing the function in Brazil. Kayvon Beykpour, the company's product lead, said the new feature would allow people to post thoughts they might have felt uncomfortable sharing publicly. He said posting on Twitter can feel ""permanent and performative"" which can intimidate some users. ""We're hoping that Fleets can help people share the fleeting thoughts that they would have been unlikely to Tweet,"" he wrote in a seven-part post on Twitter. The vanishing messages will appear when a user's profile picture is clicked. Users will not be able to reply, like, or publicly comment on any of the disappearing messages. Some Twitter users made plain their reservations. Mr Beykpour acknowledged that Fleets did sound a lot like the Stories features from Facebook and Instagram. He said Twitter was making a ""few intentional differences"" to its version. The company did not say when Fleets would be rolled out globally.","Twitter is testing a feature that will allow some tweets to disappear after 24 hours, it announced on Wednesday."
"Workers must return to their desks for at least three days a week, chief executive Tim Cook wrote. Some staff members will be given the option to work the remaining two days remotely. Teams that require ""in-person"" work will return for four or five days. Apple also told staff they will be able to apply for the chance to work remotely for two weeks a year. However, managers will need to approve remote work requests. Mr Cook said that despite a smooth transition to remote working, it was not an adequate replacement for in-person collaboration. ""For all that we've been able to achieve while many of us have been separated, the truth is that there has been something essential missing from this past year: each other,"" he said in the document, seen by The Verge. ""Video conference calling has narrowed the distance between us, to be sure, but there are things it simply cannot replicate."" He added: ""I know I'm not alone in missing the hum of activity, the energy, creativity and collaboration of our in-person meetings and the sense of community we've all built."" Apple has gone from strength-to-strength during the pandemic with its overall revenues jumping 50% year-on-year largely because of a surge in iPhone sales. The company has also been more conservative regarding its working from home policy than other tech giants. Facebook announced last year that its employees could work from home full-time as long, as they get approval from their manager. Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey also made headlines when he announced a similar policy in May 2020. But Google recently announced a similar bid to get more people back into offices for three days a week.","Apple wants its employees to return to offices by September, a company-wide memo sent to staff on Wednesday said."
"The survey found the salary difference stretched across different languages, countries and experience levels. The debate over whether it is better to use spaces or tabs to indent code has raged among programmers for years. Indents act like paragraph markers and help define how programs work. The result was ""surprising,"" said David Robinson, data scientist at Stack Overflow which carried out the survey of 12,400 developers. 'Pepsi or Coke question' He at first thought it was just a quirk of the survey rather than a real phenomenon and said he could not explain why the difference emerged. He even encouraged others to go through the data themselves to see if they could find a factor he had missed. ""Spaces versus tabs is the Pepsi or Coke question for developers,"" said Jordan Poulton, a spokesman for London's Makers Academy that teaches people to code. ""It's almost impossible to draw an objective conclusion about which is the best,"" he said. Mr Poulton said there were some computer languages, such as Python, in which indenting was essential but in others, such as Ruby, it only helped to make it easier to work out the structure of the code. Whether tabs or spaces were used could have an impact, he said, when hand-written code was turned into working software. This process is handled by a separate program called an interpreter or compiler. Some of these can crash if they encounter something, such as a tab, when they were only expecting spaces. Professional developers typically set up their coding editor to use either tabs or spaces to show the relationships between functional elements, he said. Code can get harder to read if viewed in an editor expecting tabs and getting spaces or vice versa.","Computer programmers who use spaces as part of their coding earn $15,370 (£12,000) more per year than those who use tabs, a survey of developers has revealed."
"Ginx eSports TV will be available via Sky's television service and will air footage from tournaments as well as produce original content. It plans to show Valve's Dota 2 international competition as well as global tournaments for Counter Strike. But one expert wondered where the audience for the channel would was going to come from. Competition time In a statement, Ginx boss Michiel Bakker said the channel aimed to give esports ""significant mainstream TV exposure"" that would complement the online streaming of gaming that many watch. He said he hoped that making the channel available to Sky's millions of customers would help people discover esports for the first time. It would also give established fans a different perspective on competitions and tournaments, he added. The channel will face significant competition for its audience as many gamers prefer to watch gaming streams online. Many follow regular gamers on the Twitch streaming service, on YouTube and Facebook or via sites run by game makers to broadcast top tournaments. Earlier this year, Activision Blizzard bought the Major League Gaming firm as the start of a plan to make competitive gaming more accessible. Increasing numbers of established broadcasters are also starting to put gaming tournaments on mainstream channel. Last year, the BBC aired the highlights of the quarter finals of Riot Games' League of Legends world championships. And, in the US, the sports network ESPN has also started to focus more on pro-gamers. A report published earlier in 2016 by Deloitte predicted that global revenues from esports will rise by 25% this year to $500m (£353m). Its regular audience will likely top 150 million people globally, it predicted. Alec Meer from gaming news site Rock, Paper Shotgun wondered who would be watching the tournaments and gaming-themed shows. ""It is difficult to imagine what the channel could possibly do to entice people away from watch-anywhere esports with favoured commentators and streams on YouTube and Twitch and back to broadcast TV,"" he said. Many young people had simply ""abandoned"" TV in favour of web video, he added. ""Perhaps it's in with a chance if it can bag exclusive rights, as with football, but even if it does there's so much other esports out there that there's simply no way of cornering the market,"" Mr Meer told the BBC. ""Good luck to 'em,"" he said. ""It's nice to see more gaming on TV for sure, but I rather suspect it's far too late at this stage.""",The UK will soon have its first 24-hour TV channel dedicated to competitive gaming or esports.
"The average broadband speed in the UK stands at 28.9Mbps (megabits per second), a 27% increase on the average speed last year, the study indicates. But it was weighted towards urban areas, where users enjoy services three times faster than in rural areas. Speeds in the countryside had ""not improved"" said one expert. An Ofcom spokesperson said: ""Most people's broadband is getting faster, but too many people still can't get a good, reliable service."" Dan Howdle, editor-in-chief of broadband comparison site Cable told the BBC: ""Ofcom's report is quick to highlight the increase in UK broadband speeds as an overall average and goes as far as to split things down into urban, semi-urban and rural contexts. ""However, digging into the report it becomes clear that, though never specifically stated, the headline increase is heavily weighted by urban roll-out and uptake. ""In fact, the average speed offered to those living in rural areas, by contrast, has not changed since 2014 and barely since 2013. In other words, for those who live rurally the situation has simply not improved."" The Countryside and Landowners Association's director of policy Christopher Price said that the report shone a light ""on the shocking inequality in broadband provision"". ""The figures from Ofcom indicate that a massive 75% of fixed broadband connections in rural areas are receiving an average actual speed of less than 10Mbps,"" he said. ""The government's commitment to a universal service obligation for broadband of 10Mbps by 2020 is a positive step, but these figures show how far we still have to go to reach this crucial milestone."" The report indicated that 42% of homes are now signed up to superfast services. Users of such services - defined as offering speeds up to 30Mbps or more - get actual average speeds of 56.8Mbps, suggesting that paying more for a faster service is worth it. The study also looked at average upload speeds - important for people sharing large files or using real-time two-way video communication - and found that they stood at an average of 3.7Mbps, a 0.8Mbps increase compared to 2014. The data, collected from over 2,000 volunteers using a hardware measurement unit on their broadband router, measured speeds in November 2015.",The latest report from Ofcom on UK broadband speeds suggests that there is still a wide disparity between urban and rural areas.
"The company blamed the Face ID glitch on a lockout mechanism triggered by staff members moving the device ahead of its unveil. Yahoo News was first to report the details. Apple's software chief dealt with the hiccup by moving on to a back-up device, which worked as intended. But the hitch was widely reported. ""People were handling the device for [the] stage demo ahead of time and didn't realise Face ID was trying to authenticate their face,"" an unnamed company representative is quoted as saying by Yahoo's David Pogue. ""After failing a number of times, because they weren't Craig [Federighi], the iPhone did what it was designed to do, which was to require his passcode."" Apple later confirmed to the BBC that the quote was real. At its launch event, the company had earlier described Face ID as being ""effortless"" to use and more accurate than its fingerprint-based Touch ID system. The older authentication system is not available on the new premium handset because it lacks a fingerprint sensor. So, despite the fact the incident lasted only about 10 seconds, out of a near two hour long presentation, it still has the potential to undermine confidence in the company's claims. Apple has confirmed elsewhere that Face ID is disabled after just two unsuccessful attempts, unlike Touch ID, which requires a passcode to be manually typed in only after five failed tries. Earlier theories of what had gone wrong included Mr Federighi's stage make-up interfering with the system, as he was seen to wipe his face before making his second attempt, and that the phone had been recently rebooted triggering the need for a typed code. Seeking answers Other issues concerning the new facial recognition system have also been raised, including whether it might make it easier for the authorities or thieves to force a user to unlock their handset and whether it will handle the hijab worn by some Muslim women, among other facewear. The iPhone X is not due to go on sale until November, and journalists at the launch at the company's Cupertino, California headquarters were shown Face ID working in controlled circumstances. On Wednesday, the Democrat senator Al Franken published a letter he had sent to Apple seeking more information. ""Substantial questions remain about how Face ID will impact iPhone users' privacy and security, and whether the technology will perform equally well on different groups of people,"" he wrote. ""To offer clarity to the millions of Americans who use your products, I ask that you provide more information on how the company has processed these issues internally, as well as any additional steps that it intends to take to protect its users."" Update 18 September 2017: Apple has updated its Face ID developer notes to state that the system will be disabled after five failed authentication attempts rather than two, as previously stated.",Apple has explained why its new facial recognition feature failed to unlock a handset at an on-stage demo at the iPhone X's launch on Tuesday.
"The Kinect-less version of the Xbox One game console will be available worldwide from 9 June. Unbundling the Kinect will cut the US price of the console to $399. In the UK it will be £350, the same price as Sony's PlayStation 4. Microsoft said it made the decision to unbundle the Kinect to give gamers ""more options"". It said it would start selling the Kinect separately in the autumn for those that want to add it to their Xbox One later. Deep commitment Introduced in 2010, the Kinect sensor watches the movement of a player and translates what they do into on-screen action. In addition, it lets players control what their console is doing by voice or gesture. Yusuf Mehdi, head of Xbox business strategy, said Microsoft was taking the step in response to fan feedback. ""This decision wasn't made by ourselves,"" Mr Mehdi told the BBC. ""We spent a lot of time speaking to our gaming partners and entertainment partners to balance the right feedback to meet their needs and our customers' needs."" ""We remain deeply committed to the Kinect,"" said Mr Mehdi, adding that the sensing abilities of the peripheral were what helped to make the Xbox One console a ""differentiated offering"". ""I'm glad that we launched with Kinect,"" he said. ""I'm glad that Kinect is a core part of the value proposition for Xbox One. I'm also pleased that we can continue to respond to customer feedback."" Tom Phillips, a staff writer at Eurogamer, said: ""I think it's an admission of where Xbox One is in the market right now - behind PlayStation 4 in sales."" While Sony had been vocal about sales of the PS4, Microsoft had been very quiet about how the Xbox One and its flagship games were doing, he said. ""Its silence speaks volumes, and with Titanfall seemingly not attracting the desired level of Xbox One sales, this is the next solution,"" he said. In addition to announcing the new Xbox One model, Microsoft said it was making it possible to watch Netflix, YouTube, Twitch and Hulu via the console without the need for an additional Xbox Live account.",Microsoft has announced plans to sell an Xbox One console that comes without the Kinect motion sensor.
"Last week, a blog post by writer James Bridle highlighted how YouTube was still being swamped by bizarre and indecent videos aimed at children. The site says it already stops such videos earning advertising revenue. YouTube said its team was ""made up of parents who are committed to improving our apps and getting this right"". But critics say YouTube is not taking enough action by waiting for viewers to report inappropriate videos. 'Something's wrong' The problem of video-makers using popular characters such as Peppa Pig in violent or sexual videos, to frighten children, has been widely reported. However, Mr Bridle's blog post went deeper into what he called the rabbit hole of children's content on YouTube. He gave examples of videos aimed at children that were not necessarily violent or sexual but were sinister, ""disturbing"" or otherwise inappropriate. Often it appeared that the videos had been algorithmically generated to capitalise on popular trends. ""Stock animations, audio tracks, and lists of keywords being assembled in their thousands to produce an endless stream of videos,"" he said. Many used popular family entertainment characters such as Spiderman, and Elsa from Frozen, and had been viewed millions of times. ""Someone or something or some combination of people and things is using YouTube to systematically frighten, traumatise, and abuse children, automatically and at scale,"" he wrote. YouTube says it has already barred such videos from earning advertising money when they are reported by viewers, to try to remove the incentive to produce them. However, many of the videos do not get reported by viewers and continue to carry advertisements. YouTube has now said it will give such videos an age restriction if they are reported by viewers, so they cannot be viewed by people under 18. Age-restricted videos are blocked from appearing in the YouTube Kids app, which is primarily curated by algorithms. They also cannot be viewed on the YouTube website unless people are logged in with an adult's account. However, a report in the New York Times found that inappropriate videos have previously slipped through the net. YouTube says it uses human reviewers to evaluate whether flagged videos are appropriate for a family audience. In his blog post, Mr Bridle said he did not know how YouTube could stamp out the problem. ""We have built a world which operates at scale, where human oversight is simply impossible, and no manner of inhuman oversight will counter most of the examples I've used in this essay,"" he said.",YouTube is to restrict the availability of videos showing children's characters in violent or sexual scenes if they are reported by viewers.
"By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter Yahoo confirmed that for a four-day period in January, malware was served in ads on its homepage. Experts estimate that as many as two million European users could have been hit. Security firm Light Cyber said the malware was intended to create a huge network of Bitcoin mining machines. ""The malware writers put a lot of effort into making it as efficient as possible to utilise the computing power in the best way,"" Light Cyber's founder Giora Engel told the BBC. Lucrative market Bitcoin mining malware is designed to steal computing power to make it easier for criminals to accumulate the virtual currency with little effort on their part. ""Generating bitcoins is basically guessing numbers,"" said Amichai Shulman, chief technology office of security firm Imperva. ""The first one to guess the right number gets 25 bitcoins and if you have a large volume of computers guessing in a co-ordinated way then you have a more efficient way of making money,"" he added. Other than a computer running slower, victims will be unaware that their machine is being used in what could become known as a ""bitnet"". It is a variation on the traditional botnet, networks of malware-infected computers used to churn out spam or bombard websites with requests in order to knock them offline. Some experts estimate that such networks could be generating as much as $100,000 (£60,000) each day. Since bitcoins have risen in value - at its peak one bitcoin was worth $1,000 - making it a lucrative market for online criminals. ""Bitcoin mining malware is the new frontier as criminal gangs look for new ways to make money,"" said Mr Engel. Easy target Yahoo acknowledged the attack in a statement earlier this week. ""From December 31 to January 3 on our European sites, we served some advertisements that did not meet our editorial guidelines - specifically, they spread malware,"" the statement read. It went on to say that users in America, Asia and Latin America weren't affected but did not specify how many European users were victims. Fox IT, the Dutch cybersecurity firm which revealed the malware attack, estimates that there were around 27,000 infections every hour the malware was live on the site. Over the period of the attack that could mean as many as two million machines were infected. Such attacks may be hard to avoid, said Mr Shulman. ""For an ad platform it is virtually impossible to guarantee 100% malware free ads."" ""There are many independent stakeholders involved in the process of web advertising, so from time to time any ad platform is bound to deliver malware.""","Adverts on Yahoo's homepage were infected with malware designed to mine the Bitcoin virtual currency, according to security experts."
"A channel is a curated list of video clips chosen by a specific YouTube member or celebrity. Channels are now displayed in a central column on the site's home page resembling news feeds on social networks such as Facebook or Google+. Experts say the redesign may mean people spend longer on the site, but some users have attacked the change. Complaints Around 17 hours after an official ""Get More Into YouTube"" clip explaining the move went live, 6,703 members had clicked the ""dislike"" button compared to 2,280 who had clicked ""like"". ""The layout is a mess! Why can't I remove vids which I've already watched?"" wrote one member. Others wrote ""R.I.P. Youtube"" and ""Change it back"", although some complimented the change. The site's owner, Google, has posted a blog saying that the new design was ""focused on helping you discover a broader range of entertainment"", but said there might be ""further tweaks"" depending on members' feedback. It highlighted the fact that the site now offered deeper integration with Google+ and Facebook, helping members see what their friends were sharing without leaving YouTube's site. Channels from broadcasters, including the BBC and Channel 4, are also promoted. Google is also in the process of launching around 100 channels curated by celebrities and other well-known content providers. The firm is investing tens of millions of dollars into the project. Reports suggest the singers Madonna and Jay-Z, the actor Ashton Kutcher, the creator of the CSI TV shows Antony Zuiker, and the skateboard legend Tony Hawk will be among those providing content. The majority of the new channels are expected to launch next year. Google said the site already attracts over 3 billion clip views per day. Yearning Company watchers believe the revamp will help make the site more ""sticky"". ""This does the obvious thing of keeping people longer on their site,"" said Theresa Wise, an independent media analyst. ""But it is also taking the behaviour we've seen of people going to sites such as Facebook and Twitter to see what videos are trending, and allows them to do it easily from within YouTube itself."" Analysts also believe the backlash will be short-lived, noting similar reactions after refreshes by other sites. ""The trouble with the kind of instant reaction is that most of the people who post their comments are those with extreme reactions, and their yearning for the old design will probably dissipate as they get used to it,"" said Ian Maude, internet analyst at Enders Analysis. ""But I like it - it feels fresher and more up to date and the shift to channels helps YouTube move towards professional programming to create a more TV like service. ""That makes it a more attractive environment for both content providers and advertisers.""",YouTube has revamped its website putting channels at the core of the service.
"By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor The University of Oxford's Big Data Institute has modelled a city of one million people to simulate the software's impact. If there is lower uptake, academics say the app would still help slow the spread of Covid-19. They add that letting people self-diagnose the illness could be critical. That means users would only have to answer an on-screen questionnaire before being judged to be at significant risk of infection. They would not have to speak to a health advisor or wait for a medical test result. This would send a cascade of alerts to people they had recently been in proximity to, advising them to go back into self-isolation. The experts say ""speed is of the essence"", and that delaying contact tracing by even a day from the onset of symptoms could make the difference between epidemic control and resurgence. ""There would be more people receiving notifications as a result of false warnings,"" explained Prof Christophe Fraser. ""But actually, it results in fewer days of people in self-isolation and quarantine, because the effect of suppressing the epidemic more quickly outweighs the risks in waiting for a test before the notification."" The over-70s have not been factored in, on the basis they would remain ""shielded"" by staying at home, he added. The Oxford University academics are a mix of epidemiologists and ethicists advising NHSX - the health service's digital innovation unit - on what basis the contact-tracing app should be created. They are not involved in coding or designing the software itself. Their model takes into account different age groups, household structures and movement patterns in an effort to try to maximise the number of people who could be allowed to freely move about once a contact-tracing app has been launched. ""We're looking at introducing the app towards the end of lockdown,"" Prof Fraser added. ""When you install it, it needs a few days to start recording data before it can be fully functional."" The group first published a paper about its work at the end of March. Since then, they have adjusted their model to take account of changing factors, including the fact that Covid-19's infection rate has been faster than they had anticipated. They have also changed plans from using a system that relied on GPS location readings and scanning QR codes to one that exclusively depends on Bluetooth signals. This has been done to provide users more privacy, which in turn could encourage take-up. The hope is that using the app, as well as other measures such as hand-washing and social distancing from vulnerable members of the population, will prevent a second peak in infections or the need for repeated national lockdowns. The team estimates that 56% of the general population must use the app to halt the outbreak. Prof Fraser said that equated to 80% of all existing smartphone owners, based on data from Ofcom. ""That's a very ambitious target,"" the professor acknowledged. ""It's not something that would typically happen for a new app - even an incredibly popular one - but if we can explain that this is a public health intervention, that will be new and different. ""Some of my colleagues have... commissioned large surveys in multiple European countries including the UK. ""More than 80% of people surveyed said they were likely to or would install this app when it was explained in detail what it would be doing."" Even if fewer people install the app, the team estimates that one infection will be averted for every one to two users. Opt-in app The Oxford team suggests that use of the tool should be voluntary. However, this will pose a challenge. On 20 March, Singapore became one of the first countries to deploy a voluntary contact-tracing app, TraceTogether. But only about 12% of the population installed it, and after a spike in new cases the city-state introduced a lockdown on 7 April, which it termed a ""circuit-breaker"". To further complicate matters, a small number of phones still in use in the UK do not support the Bluetooth Low Energy system required, making the target even harder to reach. Prof Fraser said that officials were discussing giving smartphones to those without - or cheaper, wearable Bluetooth devices - in order to boost the number of citizens involved. NHSX is also keen to keep the app opt-in. But some have already started exploring the implications of it becoming obligatory. Internet law expert Prof Lillian Edwards has drafted a law to safeguard citizens' rights that says: Others - including the cyber-security expert Ross Anderson and AI entrepreneur Kai-Fu Lee - have cast doubt over whether contact-tracing apps have any chance of success, and fear they could give ""false hope"" to politicians looking for a way out of lockdowns.","A contact-tracing app could help stop the coronavirus pandemic, but 80% of current smartphone owners would need to use it, say experts advising the NHS."
"It laid out its plans for the network several weeks ago but had held off announcing a date while peace talks between rival operators were brokered.

"They argued in an open letter sent to Facebook in December, that the ads went beyond misinformation to ""put people's lives in imminent danger"". Medical studies suggest drugs such as Truvada are safe. But the ads, from law firms attempting to convince gay and bisexual men to join lawsuits, suggested otherwise. They focused on harmful side effects, such as kidney issues. Facebook agreed that this was misleading: ""After a review, our independent fact-checking partners have determined some of these ads in question mislead people about the effects of Truvada. ""As a result we have rejected the ads and they can no longer run on Facebook,"" it said in a statement to the BBC. The US Center for Disease Control and Prevention has said that PrEP (Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis) drugs are ""highly effective for preventing HIV from sex and injection drug use"". Pressure has been mounting on the social network to do something about the issue since December, when an open letter signed by 50 health and LGBTQ groups was sent. It read: ""By allowing these advertisements to persist on their platforms, Facebook and Instagram are convincing at-risk individuals to avoid PrEP, invariably leading to avoidable HIV infections. You are harming public health.""","Facebook has removed adverts about HIV prevention medicines, following intense lobbying from lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer advocacy groups."
"By Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent He told the BBC:""The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race."" His warning came in response to a question about a revamp of the technology he uses to communicate, which involves a basic form of AI. But others are less gloomy about AI's prospects. The theoretical physicist, who has the motor neurone disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), is using a new system developed by Intel to speak. Machine learning experts from the British company Swiftkey were also involved in its creation. Their technology, already employed as a smartphone keyboard app, learns how the professor thinks and suggests the words he might want to use next. Prof Hawking says the primitive forms of artificial intelligence developed so far have already proved very useful, but he fears the consequences of creating something that can match or surpass humans. ""It would take off on its own, and re-design itself at an ever increasing rate,"" he said. ""Humans, who are limited by slow biological evolution, couldn't compete, and would be superseded."" But others are less pessimistic. ""I believe we will remain in charge of the technology for a decently long time and the potential of it to solve many of the world problems will be realised,"" said Rollo Carpenter, creator of Cleverbot. Cleverbot's software learns from its past conversations, and has gained high scores in the Turing test, fooling a high proportion of people into believing they are talking to a human. Rise of the robots Mr Carpenter says we are a long way from having the computing power or developing the algorithms needed to achieve full artificial intelligence, but believes it will come in the next few decades. ""We cannot quite know what will happen if a machine exceeds our own intelligence, so we can't know if we'll be infinitely helped by it, or ignored by it and sidelined, or conceivably destroyed by it,"" he says. But he is betting that AI is going to be a positive force. Prof Hawking is not alone in fearing for the future. In the short term, there are concerns that clever machines capable of undertaking tasks done by humans until now will swiftly destroy millions of jobs. In the longer term, the technology entrepreneur Elon Musk has warned that AI is ""our biggest existential threat"". Robotic voice In his BBC interview, Prof Hawking also talks of the benefits and dangers of the internet. He quotes the director of GCHQ's warning about the net becoming the command centre for terrorists: ""More must be done by the internet companies to counter the threat, but the difficulty is to do this without sacrificing freedom and privacy."" He has, however, been an enthusiastic early adopter of all kinds of communication technologies and is looking forward to being able to write much faster with his new system. But one aspect of his own tech - his computer generated voice - has not changed in the latest update. Prof Hawking concedes that it's slightly robotic, but insists he didn't want a more natural voice. ""It has become my trademark, and I wouldn't change it for a more natural voice with a British accent,"" he said. ""I'm told that children who need a computer voice, want one like mine.""","Prof Stephen Hawking, one of Britain's pre-eminent scientists, has said that efforts to create thinking machines pose a threat to our very existence."
"By Kevin RawlinsonBBC News The new problem - similar to the first - could leave users' personal information vulnerable, researchers backed by the US government said. Dell said it had again released a fix, after doing the same for the first problem earlier this week. The repeated issues raised concerns about the company's attitude towards security, one expert told the BBC. In a statement, Dell said that the second problem affected users who downloaded its Dell System Detect product between 20 October and 24 November 2015. It said the second issue was not pre-installed on computers - as the first was. It said the product was removed from its site once the issue was spotted and a replacement application was made available. Earlier this week, Dell said it had inadvertently opened up a security hole in its computers when it pre-installed software on them. A self-signed root certificate authority (CA), which is used to identify trustworthy websites, was ""implemented as part of a support tool and intended to make it faster and easier for our customers to service their system"", Dell said. But the CA it installed, called ""eDellRoot"", allowed hackers to intercept a Dell user's internet traffic, while the private key that came installed with it could be used to trick the computer into thinking that unsafe websites were safe, security researchers pointed out. 'Impersonation' The second vulnerability, another CA called ""DSDTestProvider"", worked in much the same way, according to the Germany-based journalist who reported it to US Department of Homeland Security-backed researchers at Carnegie Mellon University: Hanno Böck. In their subsequent report, the researchers wrote: ""An attacker can generate certificates signed by the DSDTestProvider CA. Systems that trusts the DSDTestProvider CA will trust any certificate issued by the CA. ""An attacker can impersonate web sites and other services, sign software and email messages, and decrypt network traffic and other data. ""Common attack scenarios include impersonating a web site, performing a [man-in-the-middle] attack to decrypt HTTPS traffic, and installing malicious software."" Such an attack involves the hacker intercepting internet traffic between the user's browser and the site they are accessing. The Surrey University security expert Prof Alan Woodward said: ""To paraphrase Oscar Wilde, to have one self-signing certificate installed could be a mistake; to have two looks like carelessness. ""The fact that there appears to be a second self-signing certificate does make you wonder what else might be lurking on the machine."" A Dell spokesman said: ""When we became aware of eDellRoot earlier this week, we immediately dug into all our applications that get loaded on Dell PCs. We can confirm we have found no other root certificates on the factory-installed PC image. ""What we did find was that the Dell System Detect application and its DSDTestProvider root certificate had similar characteristics to eDellRoot. ""The application was removed from the Dell support site immediately and a replacement application without the certificate is now available.""

"By Paul RubensTechnology reporter For that you'll get the bank account details, plus online username and password providing you with full access to the money. For criminal buyers that price is a steal compared with the sums they were paying as little as two years ago. Back in 2011 the most they could have expected to acquire for $300 would have been a compromised bank account with just $7,000 in it, and probably less, the researchers say, The investigation was carried out by Joe Stewart, director of malware research at Dell SecureWorks, and David Shear, an independent researcher. The pair have monitored Russian and other criminal forums on the internet in which financial details are traded. Mr Stewart says that the price of all sorts of stolen financial information has fallen sharply over the past year on hacker black markets, and suggests this is the result of some large scale data breaches that have occurred during the period. The glut in supply could continue for some time. ""I think that there is a lot further for prices to fall,"" he says. Secrets for sale It's not just the price of online bank account credentials that has fallen, Mr Stewart adds. For example, a full dossier of financial and other information about an individual that can be used to commit identity theft now costs just $25 for a US victim, or $30-40 for a British one. Two years ago these full dossiers - known as Fullz in hacker speak - changed hands for as much as $60 each. A typical Fullz contains a victim's: And one or more from the following: In fact, it now appears there is such a large supply of stolen credit card details that hackers have had to slash their prices and take even more extreme measures to sell them before they expire or are cancelled. ""Hackers used to steal credit card details one at a time, but now they have figured out where to steal large numbers of details in one go,"" Mr Stewart says. ""Sellers on these black markets will now usually give you a few credit card details for free so you can check them out, and then you can buy them in lots of about a thousand."" The going rate is about $4 per card for US Visa or Mastercard details, and $7-$8 for UK or European ones, he says. Sophisticated scams The reason that stolen US information is worth less than UK or European financial information is partly because it is harder and more costly for criminals to transfer stolen funds from the US to where they are - which is usually Eastern Europe or Asia, Mr Stewart says. This usually involves using middlemen who take a cut to launder the money. The Fullz packages have only been available for a few years, and their existence indicates that criminals are getting more sophisticated in their offerings, according to Mr Stewart. ""Previously they just offered lists of credit card numbers, but offering Fullz shows that hackers have got smarter and are now able to target places where a wide range of personal data is warehoused,"" he says. Cybercriminals have also become more sophisticated in the way they offer stolen financial data to prospective customers. This includes setting up websites with search facilities that allow them to search for stolen online details for specific banks. ""They set these up as subscription services, and subscribers can then run as many searches as they like for accounts at specific banks that they can get cash out from most conveniently,"" he says. Not all prices are falling in the world of cybercrime world, however. Computer hackers try to identify and then exploit vulnerabilities in programs and operating systems to gain access to credit card details and other data. Bitcoin burglars Stefan Frei, research director at security consultancy NSS Labs, says that the price that cybercriminals are willing to pay for newly discovered vulnerabilities is rising and the more secure a platform is perceived to be, the more the hack would be worth. ""People are putting more of their life on their computers, so the value to a hacker per computer is much higher than before,"" he explains. ""An iOS vulnerability may now change hands for $500,000 or even $1m."" Looking ahead, Mr Stewart believes the rise of Bitcoin - a virtual currency - could cause the thieves to change focus. Businesses are attracted to supporting the innovation as an alternative to cash because it is cheap to use, payments are almost instant, and the move gains them publicity. But the Dell researcher warns that digital wallets - the computer programs used to store bitcoins - make more tempting targets for hackers than real bank accounts. ""Many Bitcoin users don't know much about security, and many protect their digital wallets with a user name and password that criminals can get past easily using malware,"" he says. ""The beauty for a criminal is that if you steal a Bitcoin wallet you don't have to go through a middleman like you do with a real bank account to move the money. You can just cash it out instantly anywhere in the world.""","Fancy a bank account with $300,000 (£184,000) in it? If you know where to look and you don't mind dealing with cybercriminals then the going rate is just $300, a study of the hacking underworld suggests."
"The malicious adverts were spotted by security firm Trend Micro, which watches crypto-cash malware. The adverts included computer code that helped them mine the Monero crypto-currency. The rapid rise in the value of crypto-coins has prompted many cyber-crime gangs to try and cash in by using innocent machines to generate the cash. Cashing out The gangs are keen to get malicious code on lots of computers because most crypto-currencies rely on large networks of machines to verify transactions and generate new coins. The more machines working for them, the more coins they can extract. Chaoying Liu and Joseph Chen from Trend Micro said the first sign of the campaign was a sudden tripling of the number of malicious coin-mining scripts the company caught. Investigating the increase, the pair found a lot of advertisements that contained code for a well-known miner called Coinhive. ""Attackers abused Google's DoubleClick, which develops and provides internet ad serving services, for traffic distribution,"" said the researchers. On victims' machines, when the mining script was triggered it would use 80% of the computer's processing power to generate coins. Trend Micro said it passed on its findings to Google who said it been ""actively monitoring"" this type of malware campaign. ""In this case, the ads were blocked in less than two hours and the malicious actors were quickly removed from our platforms,"" it said in a statement. Security researcher Chris Boyd, from anti-virus maker Malwarebytes, said the rapidly rising value of crypto-currencies such as Bitcoin had proved irresistible to many cyber-criminals. ""Coin-mining has proven to be quite the craze,"" he said. It had become so popular because it involved less work than was required by many other scams, he added. ""If you are into scams and malware and hijacks, you are always looking for the path of least resistance,"" he said.",YouTube has been briefly caught out by adverts that sought to mine valuable crypto-coins using visitors' computers.
"The full names, addresses and phone numbers of users went astray in the 2016 attack. The data had been stolen thanks to ""avoidable data security flaws"", said the Information Commissioner's Office. Uber has also been fined 600,000 euros (£532,000) by data regulators in Holland over the same breach, as it also affected 174,000 Dutch customers. Data destruction ""This was not only a serious failure of data security on Uber's part but a complete disregard for the customers and drivers whose personal information was stolen,"" said Steve Eckersley, director of investigations at the ICO. Uber had done nothing to alert people that data had been downloaded or to support people affected, he added. Customers whose data had been stolen had been left at ""increased risk of fraud"", he said. The details on 2.7 million customers were part of a massive cache of information on 57 million people taken by the hacker group in October and November 2016. Uber paid the attackers $100,000 (£78,400) to destroy the data they took. Paying the hackers and then saying nothing about it was ""not an appropriate response to the cyber-attack"", said Mr Eckersley. In response, Uber said it had changed how it handled data since 2016 and now employed a chief privacy officer and a data protection head who oversaw its operations. It added: ""We've made a number of technical improvements to the security of our systems both in the immediate wake of the incident as well as in the years since."" ""We're pleased to close this chapter on the data incident from 2016,"" it said. In the US, Uber paid $148m to settle federal charges over the 2016 breach.","Uber has been fined £385,000 for letting hackers steal data on 2.7 million UK customers."
"The attack, known as Shamoon, is said to have hit ""at least one organisation"" in the sector. Shamoon is capable of wiping files and rendering several computers on a network unusable. On Wednesday, Saudi Arabia's national oil company said an attack had led to its own network being taken offline. Although Saudi Aramco did not link the issue to the Shamoon threat, it did confirm that the company had suffered a ""sudden disruption"". In a statement, the company said it had now isolated its computer networks as a precautionary measure. The disruptions were ""suspected to be the result of a virus that had infected personal workstations without affecting the primary components of the network"", a statement read. It said the attack had had ""no impact whatsoever"" on production operations. Rendered unusable On Thursday, security firms released the first detailed information about Shamoon. Experts said the threat was known to have had hit ""at least one organisation"" in the energy sector. ""It is a destructive malware that corrupts files on a compromised computer and overwrites the MBR (Master Boot Record) in an effort to render a computer unusable,"" wrote security firm Symantec. The attack was designed to penetrate a computer through the internet, before targeting other machines on the same network that were not directly connected to the internet. Once infected, the machines' data is wiped. A list of the wiped files then sent back to the initially infected computer, and in turn passed on to the attacker's command-and-control centre. During this process, the attack replaces the deleted files with JPEG images - obstructing any potential file recovery by the victim. 'Under the radar' Seculert, an Israel-based security specialist, also analysed the malicious code and concluded that it had unusual characteristics compared with other recent attacks. ""The interesting part of this malware is that instead of staying under the radar and collect information, the malware was designed to overwrite and wipe the files,"" the company said. ""Why would someone wipe files in a targeted attack and make the machine unusable?"" Shamoon is the latest in a line of attacks that have targeted infrastructure. One of the most high-profile attacks in recent times was Stuxnet, which was designed to hit nuclear infrastructure in Iran. Others, like Duqu, have sought to infiltrate networks in order to steal data.",A new threat targeting infrastructure in the energy industry has been uncovered by security specialists.
"By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter They way we communicate online jumped back into the headlines last week when Monica Lewinsky, famous for her love affair with President Clinton, spoke at the Ted (Technology, Entertainment and Design) conference in Vancouver. Describing herself as one of the first victims of cyber-gossip, she said that it had taken her over a decade to get over it. Now back in the public eye, she called for a more compassionate internet. Community spirit? We have all seen nasty comments online - whether they be a row on Twitter or a catty response on Facebook. The internet acts like a kind of digital-fuelled alcohol, freeing us to say things to strangers that we would never dare to say if we met them. Dave Harte, a lecturer in media communication at Birmingham City University, believes that social media gives us a connection with each other that we are all craving. ""We have a vague sense of having lost something - the idea of chatting to a neighbour or meeting at the village post office. In many ways it is a media-created perception. Maybe we have all watched too many episodes of 'Call the Midwife',"" he said. ""But we are always trying to retrieve it and having a digital presence can often seem like a trouble-free replacement for meeting each other."" Even back in the early days of the internet, online chat could very easily turn sour. ""Discussions in these groups would have followed a similar pattern. People with shared interests come together but often they would disintegrate because the internet gives people the opportunity to say things that you wouldn't say face to face,"" said Mr Harte. Heartbreaking comments Trolling has become an established term for people who sow discord on the internet by starting arguments - and there are a lot of them around. Women seem to be particularly prone - a survey conducted by cosmetics firm Dove and Twitter found that in 2014 over five million negative tweets were posted about beauty and body image - and four out of five of them appeared to come from women. Danah Boyd, principal researcher at Microsoft Research and a recognised expert on how we use social media, commented in a recent blog: ""Over the last few years, as the internet went from being a geeky subculture to something that is truly mainstream, I started watching as young women used technology to demean themselves and each other. It has broken my heart over and over again."" ""It's high time that we all stop and reflect on what we're saying and posting when we use our fingers to talk in public,"" she concluded. Following the survey, Twitter has set up a partnership with Dove dubbed #SpeakBeautiful aimed at trying to counteract internet negativity. Suburban gossip I know a bit about how women interact online because, until recently, I was a member of a Facebook group called Maidenhead Gossip Girls - made up of 8,000 plus women based in or around the Thames-side Berkshire town. Funnily enough there wasn't a lot of gossip on it. Instead there were lots of questions asking for recommendations for local tradespeople, good restaurants to visit, things to do with the kids on a wet Bank Holiday weekend. People posted pictures of their children's rashes and asked for an online diagnosis. Some seemed never to have heard of search engines, asking questions for which the obvious answer was ""Google it"". And a few members made no distinction between the group they had joined with 7,999 strangers and their own personal Facebook page, sharing information that could easily be prefaced with the words 'too much'. There were lots of positive posts on there - requests for charity donations elicited many responses, lone mothers were put in touch with others in the same situation, requests to help out a down-on-their-luck friend with old furniture brought floods of offers and a picture of a lost teddy found in the street meant the toy was quickly reunited with its distraught child-owner. But there were also a lot of arguments. A woman asking for recommendations for where to get her young daughter's ears pierced got more than she bargained for when several group members questioned whether ear-piercing for a young child was something she should even be considering. Others hopped in to defend her right to ask the question and soon the argument had moved far beyond the original question. Seemingly innocent threads recommending a local clairvoyant, asking how to treat Thrush, where to buy a paper lantern or simply showing off about how a toddler had learned to read - all seemed to blow up into heated discussions. Some of the more inflammatory posts would run to hundreds of comments, each getting a little snipier than the last. Little wonder then that one disaffected member decided to start her own group. Dubbed The Maidenhead Mumble (MM) it was clear from the start it would be a satirical version of MGG. Posts on MGG - now known to members of the new group as ""dark side"" - were parodied. Pictures of severed fingers were posted next to questions ' should I go to the doctors or just put a plaster on it?"" People referred to each other as ""tossers"" and there was quite a lot of swearing - not really allowed on MGG. If MGG was a pleasant cafe by the river Thames where respectable mums drank coffee, MM was a smokey bar where shots were the preferred choice. And while there were, refreshingly, no arguments between members, it was developing a dark side of its own with individuals from MGG singled out and openly ridiculed. There was also clearly a double-agent - referred to as ""the mole"" - who was passing information back to MGG on what was happening on MM. As a result, people who had posted in the new group suddenly found themselves barred from MGG. Including me. Initially outraged that I had been blocked when I hadn't broken any of its rules - I had never even posted on the group - I contacted the administrators; five local women. Be nicer I was offered no explanation as to why I was removed and when I said I was going to write something on the BBC about it, I was told ""no comment"". Facebook confirmed that it was up to administrators to make decisions about members and if they wanted to change the settings from Public to Secret they could, removing whoever they chose along the way - even if they hadn't broken any rules. The social network did not want to comment specifically on my case but more generally a spokeswoman said: ""Unfortunately there are some people who set out to annoy or frustrate others online, just as in everyday life. Our rules and tools are designed to help keep Facebook a respectful place for the 1.3 billion people who use our service around the world."" The problem is that the nature of the internet means that within groups and the wider social networks we are all part of, people are only a few clicks away from being able to annoy frustrate or upset a whole range of people - often strangers. And for many the temptation to respond to a post they find annoying or frustrating is just too hard to resist - as I encountered on MGG. What we do to counteract that is unclear but we could start by following the advice of the woman who has been victim to more cyber-gossip and net negativity than perhaps any other. During her Ted speech, Ms Lewinsky urged people simply to ""post something positive"".",It used to be the case that people got their gossip over the garden fence or from a bit of curtain twitching. But now we have the internet and the nature of chat has changed forever.
"By Chris Fox & Zoe KleinmanBBC Technology reporters The game is rooted in ancient mythology and stars Kratos, the former Greek god of war, and his son Atreus. Fortnite, released in 2017, was named best evolving game. Despite receiving six nominations, UK-made western adventure Red Dead Redemption 2 walked away empty-handed at the glitzy ceremony in central London. The first God of War game was released in 2005. This eighth instalment in the series, developed by Santa Monica Studio, sees its iconic lead character Kratos - son of Zeus - as a struggling single parent. Cory Barlog, director of God of War, told the BBC winning the awards was ""amazing, overwhelming, and scary"". He said the win showed that story-led games could be as ""relevant"" as the presently popular Battle Royale style titles. Nintendo's Labo won two awards, one for best family game and the other for innovation. It is the cardboard toolkit that lets players explore the interactivity of the firm's Switch console, for example by creating a piano. The Bafta winners in full were: BBC Radio 1 Newsbeat's gaming reporter Steffan Powell said it was surprising that Red Dead Redemption 2 had not won in any category. ""A game of such depth and innovation (whether you finished it or not!) - their loss is the independent sector's gain. Tonight shows titles from smaller teams that manage to speak a certain truth to players can be just as successful (in awards terms - not cash!) as the big guns,"" he tweeted. Presenter Dara O'Briain told the BBC the event celebrates the diversity of the games industry and the award results can be surprising. ""Like the movie industry suddenly going indie and choosing all indie and not choosing the blockbusters, Bafta has a tendency to do that,"" he said. Sales of video games, consoles, PC gaming add-ons and other related products topped £5.7bn in the UK last year, according to trade body Ukie. That is another record high and a 10% improvement on the previous year. However, the VR hardware market had a more difficult year according to the IHS Markit consultancy. Sales dropped by 20.9% to £72m.",Action-adventure game God of War has won the sought-after Best Game prize at the 15th annual Bafta Games Awards.
"For years the Necurs botnet has distributed junk mail and malware for many different groups of cyber-thieves. But the amount of malicious traffic emerging from Necurs has now dwindled to almost nothing. It is not clear what has caused the slowdown and whether traffic will return to previously high levels. One of the first signs of the disruption was seen earlier this month when email messages spreading the Dridex banking trojan and Locky ransomware caught by security firms dried up. Typically, millions of messages bearing these malicious programs are sent out every week, Proofpoint said in a blogpost. However, the flood of messages ""essentially stopped"" last week, it said. Investigations revealed that these messages typically travelled via the Necurs botnet which was found to have gone largely offline. Rootkit The Necurs botnet is believed to be made up of about six million compromised Windows machines, many of which were enrolled when their owners inadvertently fell victim to a form of malware known as a rootkit. Analysis of some of the machines known to be part of Necurs shows that its core administration systems have disappeared, said Proofpoint. ""Data from a variety of sources show that Necurs bots are actively looking for a new command and control (C&C) system, but we have no evidence that the Necurs botmaster has been able to retake control of the botnet."" A botnet's C&C system helps the network keep running and co-ordinates the distribution of any spam or malware being sent out via the global collection of computers. Security researchers who monitor botnets and the groups that operate them said the cause of the shutdown remained a mystery. ""We cannot confirm how the botnet was brought down yet,"" Joonho Sa, a researcher for FireEye, told tech news site Motherboard.","One of the biggest networks of spam-sending computers in the world has gone quiet, puzzling experts, internet security firms have said."
"Dave LeeNorth America technology reporter On stage in San Jose, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg acknowledged the prohibitive cost of the current Oculus Rift headset. During the presentation he also demonstrated software for interacting with friends in virtual reality. Missing, however, was the Oculus co-founder Palmer Luckey. The 23-year-old, normally a fixture of the company’s events, was recently revealed to be funding an online campaign in support of Presidential candidate Donald Trump. He later apologised. A spokesman told the BBC Mr Luckey did not attend the event as he wanted to avoid being a “distraction” to the day's announcements. Mr Luckey was not mentioned, nor did he appear in any of the promotion videos shown during the keynote presentation. Technology analyst Ben Woods, from CCS Insight, said Mr Luckey’s role at the company may be limited in future. “I think even without that distraction, which was unfortunate, he probably wouldn’t have had a big role here anyway. ""The company has moved on from someone jumping on stage in flip-flops and Hawaiian shirts saying crazy stuff - it has to professionalise if this is to be a cornerstone of Facebook’s future."" Holy grail The event, Oculus’s third ever developer conference, comes as it faces fierce competition in the VR market. Earlier this week Google showed the first version of Daydream VR, its headset which is powered by mobile phone. And next week Sony is set to launch its PlayStation VR headset. It will work with the PlayStation 4 console, making it a considerably cheaper than the Oculus - though not as powerful. At the higher-end of the VR market, HTC Vive has been well-received by gamers and has the backing of PC gaming giant Valve. It leaves Facebook in need of a holy grail headset that offers high-end visuals and interaction at a price more akin to the lower end models currently on the market. That’s being worked on now, Mr Zuckerberg said. “We believe that there is a sweet spot - a standalone virtual reality product that is high quality, that is affordable, and you can bring with you out into the world. ""It’s still early, so I don’t want to get your hopes up too much."" The key innovation will be in using Computer Vision Software (CVS), Mr Zuckerberg said. This would enable the headset to see what’s around it and detect its own movements - allowing the wearer to walk around freely. Currently, the Oculus Rift - and other high-end headsets - use a series of sensors to track the person’s movements around a set area. Social interaction As he has done in the past, Mr Zuckerberg referred to virtual reality as the next major computing platform. On stage, he demonstrated a VR environment for interacting with friends. Mr Zuckerberg was placed in a virtual environment with two colleagues. Each could see an avatar of each other - a cartoon-like figure designed to resemble the real person. Using the Oculus Rift’s handheld touch controllers, each avatar could be controlled to show a range of emotions such as laughter and shock. Voice sentiment analysis was also used to convey emotions on the avatars. In the same demo, the surrounding environment was changed to a 360-degree video of Mr Zuckerberg’s front room - along with his dog, Beast. Here, Mr Zuckerberg was able to take a real-world video call from his wife, Priscilla Chan. It was a baffling array of technologies laid on top of each other, and an intriguing glimpse into what a social network like Facebook might become in the virtual world. Product releases It will take some time before this software is ready, and the Facebook founder will have a task on his hands to convince users that hanging out with friends virtually can be a comfortable experience. “It’s more of a statement of intent then something consumers will be able to get their heads around today,” said Mr Wood from CCS Insight. ""Virtual social presence is really Mark Zuckerberg’s big commercial bet as a future chapter for Facebook. ""We’ll look back on today and see that it’s a pivotal moment in how Facebook envisions VR in its mass consumer offering.” In the run up to Christmas, Oculus is putting out some long-awaited pieces of hardware. Its handheld Touch controllers, first announced more than a year ago, will be released on 6 December, and will cost $199. Additional motion sensors, which will allow “room scale” VR so players can move around more freely, will soon be able to be bought separately for $79 (£63). There will be 35 new gaming titles available when Touch launches, Oculus said, a number which may rise. Of the new offerings, it was Epic Games' Robot Recall, a comedic take on a robot revolution, that stood out.

"It follows an attack which saw the logos of six of the UK broadcaster's apps replaced by that of the SEA. The hackers also breached one of the firm's Twitter accounts, allowing them to post messages urging users to view the defaced programmes. Targeting apps in this manner marks a new strategy for the group. Its efforts have previously focused on taking over social media accounts used by the media and western political leaders, and publishing what are claimed to be leaked emails and other files from countries in the Middle East identified as ""Syria's enemies"". Israeli newspapers also reported over the weekend that the SEA had mounted a failed attempt to disrupt the water supply in the port city of Haifa. Defaced apps The SEA says on its website that its members are supporters of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, but deny they operate under the orders of his government. Over recent weeks their victims have included the BBC, Daily Telegraph, Financial Times, Guardian, E! Online, the Onion, CBS News, Associated Press, the US's National Public Radio (NPR) and the football governing body Fifa. On Friday, ITV - the UK's largest commercial broadcaster - joined that list when its @itvlondon Twitter account was hijacked and used to post fake news stories. The company confirmed it had been duped by a phishing attack suggesting one of its employees had been fooled into clicking a malicious link. The SEA followed this with the attack on Sky on Sunday. The company's Sky News, Sky Sports News, Sky Sports Football, Sky WiFi, Sky+ and Sky Go apps were all affected. In addition to having their logos replaced, their descriptions were also altered to read: ""Syrian Electronic Army Was Here"". The hackers subsequently posted a message to the firm's @SkyHelp Team account saying: ""Both Sky+, SkyNews Android apps were hacked and replaced, please uninstall the apps"", adding a link which took users to the Google Play page showing the affected software. As of Monday morning, this and other spoof messages had not been deleted. Another Sky account stated that: ""Due to a security breach Twitter has locked down @skyhelpteam & we are currently unable to tweet from it."" A spokesman for the company told the BBC it was working to reinstate its apps following the decision to take them offline. The incident came days after Twitter announced it was introducing a two-step authentication process to help thwart further attacks. The security measure involves users entering a six-digit security code sent to their mobile phone account in addition to their password when they sign into the network. Israel attack The SEA's latest action coincided with an allegation by one of Israel's leading cyber-defence experts that the group had tried and failed to sabotage Haifa's water supply. The Jerusalem Post reports that Prof Yitzhak Ben Yisrael - chairman of the Science Ministry's National Council for Research and Development - said that the hackers had intended to damage computers controlling the northern city's infrastructure earlier this month. He suggested the attack was a response to Israeli air strikes on Damascus. The Times of Israel adds that both the city's mayor and the head of the local water company said they had not been informed about the incident before the weekend. The SEA has previously posted a message to Pastebin claiming it had successfully penetrated computer servers used to control Haifa's urban management systems.",Several of Sky's Android apps have been removed from the Google Play store after they were targeted by the Syrian Electronic Army hacking collective.
"Dave LeeNorth America technology reporter A report by technology news site Gizmodo said staff responsible for what was shown to Facebook's 1.6bn users frequently chose to bury articles they did not agree with. Responding to the allegations, the network's head of search Tom Stocky wrote that the site ""found no evidence that the anonymous allegations are true"". The claims come weeks after Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg publicly denounced the policies of likely US presidential nominee, Donald Trump. ""I hear fearful voices calling for building walls and distancing people they label as 'others.',"" the 31-year-old said at his firm's recent developers conference. However, Facebook insisted Mr Zuckerberg's view did not influence what stories are given added visibility on the network. Human curation The Trending Topics column appears in the top right corner of a typical Facebook page. It is designed to highlight what subjects are being discussed heavily by Facebook users around the world. Facebook explained in a statement that this list was edited by humans so as to avoid regularly recurring popular topics - such as ""lunch"". Facebook's Mr Stocky explained: ""Popular topics are first surfaced by an algorithm, then audited by review team members to confirm that the topics are in fact trending news in the real world and not, for example, similar-sounding topics or misnomers."" The Gizmodo story, which quoted a person it said they had been one of the editors, alleged Facebook staff were routinely tampering with Trending Topic stories. Gizmodo's source added that staff were told to seek out stories published on the BBC, CNN and other mainstream sites ahead of publications with a clearly stated political bias - even if the stories originated on those smaller outlets. Also, if several mainstream media sites were covering the same story, Facebook would - according to the source - artificially place it in the Trending Topic column, even if it was not being discussed heavily by users. Breitbart, one of the leading conservative news sources in the US, said the reports confirmed what they had ""long suspected"", that ""Facebook's trending news artificially mutes conservatives and amplifies progressives"". The anonymous source also claimed that stories staff favoured - such as the Black Lives Matter movement - were given artificially greater prominence. Facebook said that this was ""untrue"". After a day of growing reports across social media and in conservative-leaning publications, Facebook's Mr Stocky posted a response on his profile. ""We have in place strict guidelines for our trending topic reviewers as they audit topics surfaced algorithmically,"" he wrote. ""Reviewers are required to accept topics that reflect real world events, and are instructed to disregard junk or duplicate topics, hoaxes, or subjects with insufficient sources. ""Facebook does not allow or advise our reviewers to systematically discriminate against sources of any ideological origin and we've designed our tools to make that technically not feasible. ""At the same time, our reviewers' actions are logged and reviewed, and violating our guidelines is a fireable offense.""

"By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor The surprise launch pits the firm against Microsoft, which completed its takeover of Nokia's previous mobile-devices business in April. The N1 tablet is due to go on sale in China towards the start of 2015, ahead of other countries. Nokia said it was not making the device itself, but had licensed its brand, design and software to a third-party. Taiwanese manufacture Foxconn is the licensee. ""This is a great product for Nokia fans and everyone who has not found the right Android tablet yet,"" said Sebastian Nystrom, head of products at Nokia Technologies, who announced the product at the Slush technology conference in Helsinki. One company watcher was startled by the move. ""I'm surprised how quickly Nokia has decided to do this. But equally if Nokia was going to do anything with its brand, it was going to have to do it quickly,"" said Ben Wood, chief of research at CCS Insight. ""The brand has been in a consistent state of freefall over the past three years, so if they are going to extract any value from it they needed to do it sooner than later."" Microsoft sells Nokia-labelled kit of its own, including the Lumia 2520 Windows RT-powered tablet. Earlier this month, it unveiled its first Lumia smartphone without the Nokia name. But it indicated that it would continue using the brand on its less powerful ""feature phone"" line-up, saying it had the right to do so for up to a decade under the terms of its $7.2bn (£4.6bn) takeover. It is not clear whether Nokia's announcement affects those plans. ""There's no question Microsoft will not be a little frustrated that at a time when it's trying to defocus the Nokia brand, here is something that resurrects it prematurely,"" said Mr Wood. ""In some respects it will also cause a bit of confusion."" The only comment from Microsoft was a brief statement: ""This is a Nokia announcement and is not associated in any way with Microsoft."" Android skin The N1 is a 7.9in (20.1cm) aluminium-framed tablet, whose design resembles the iPad Mini. Unlike Apple's device, however, it is powered by Google's Android 5.0 operating system, features an Intel Atom processor and has a Micro-USB slot. The planned retail price is $249 (£159). It runs Nokia's own Z Launcher user interface - known as a skin - on top of Android. The previously announced software allows owners to draw letters on the tablet's screen with one of their fingers to search for related content and changes the apps presented on the machine's home screen according to the time of day and the device's location. ""For Nokia, the advantages of licensing are considerable. Nokia can enter the mobile device market without needing to worry about manufacturing, supply chain management, stock control or hardware distribution,"" said Ian Fogg, director of mobile analysis at research firm IHS Technology. But, he noted, previous partnerships had not lived to expectation. ""The Symbian venture over a smartphone OS ran into the ground amid bureaucracy and differing partner visions,"" he said. ""Nokia failed to establish successful licensing of its Series 60 software. The Intel partnership with Meego [an operating system] was aborted after just one year in as Nokia switched to Microsoft. ""And, Nokia has only just extricated itself from the choice of Windows Phone. Nokia must execute much better with licensing and mobile devices this time if it is to succeed."" Nokia reported a return to health in October after it posted a third-quarter net profit of 747m euros ($935m; £597m) thanks to the work of its network equipment, mapping and software divisions, which had previously been weighed down by its loss-making hardware business.","Nokia is launching an Android-powered tablet, marking the Finnish company's return to consumer electronics."
"A data science unit, part-owned by the UK government, has been training algorithms to rate schools, using machine learning - a form of AI. It plans to work with England education watchdog Ofsted to help prioritise inspections. The NAHT said effective inspection of schools should not be based on data. ""We need to move away from a data-led approach to school inspection,"" the union said in a statement. ""It is important that the whole process is transparent and that schools can understand and learn from any assessment. ""Leaders and teachers need absolute confidence that the inspection system will treat teachers and leaders fairly."" Social purpose company Behavioural Insights Team, part-owned by innovation charity Nesta, has laid out how the artificial intellgence system would work in a report. Lead author Michael Sanders told the BBC: ""If it was put in the field, it would be used to prioritise which schools should be inspected, and we are hoping to work with Ofsted over the next 12 months to improve the algorithm and tailor it to suit that purpose."" The data used to train the algorithm includes past Ofsted inspections, other data from schools and census information, all of which is publicly available. It also analysis responses about individual schools provided by parents via Ofsted's Parent View. The data produced by the algorithm will not be shared with schools and Mr Sanders said it would not be helpful to do so. ""If we chased down the findings of the algorithms and offered five things that would make your school better, that would be disingenuous,"" he said. ""Ofsted inspectors who do holistic inspections are in a much better place to provide advice."" Currently the algorithms are designed purely as a tool to help Ofsted, but Mr Sanders acknowledged that there could be future applications. ""Predictive grades for GCSEs are based on teachers' judgements, but there is research that suggests they aren't all that accurate,"" he said. ""Using data to give a better picture might be a better way of helping young people in their education."" But, he added: ""Any other applications would require ethical and practical oversight.""",Plans to use algorithms to identify failing schools have been criticised by the National Association of Head Teachers.
"By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor The innovation vastly increases the number of light sources on the TV's back panel in order to deliver more ""dimming zones"". These should help the screens enhance bright details without the light spilling into surrounding dark areas. Chinese brand TCL unveiled the first TVs to be based on the tech in 2019, and Samsung is rumoured to be readying its own models. LG has promised to show off at least 10 4K and 8K Mini-LED televisions at next year's CES, which is being held as a virtual event, rather than in Las Vegas as normal, because of the coronavirus pandemic. ""[Their] light source, brightness and contrast are far superior to that of conventional LCD televisions,"" it said in a press release. Less blooming LG has said it plans to market the TVs under a new QNED MicroLED banner, adding to an already confusing barrage of acronyms under which the different television manufacturers market their wares. The: LG - the world's second bestselling TV brand after Samsung - has said there will be nearly 30,000 of the tiny LEDs at the back of its largest 86in (218cm) screens. That is vastly more than the dozens of larger LEDs used in budget-priced ""back-lit"" and ""edge-lit"" TVs, or even the hundreds in ""full-array models."" The LEDs are used to illuminate the screens' colour pixels. The theory is that by having more of them, it is possible to better control which parts of the image are bright and which should remain dim. This should reduce the blooming effect you sometimes get when displaying images such as stars in a night sky or text on a dark background, when the light appears to bleed beyond where it is supposed to. In total, LG says the screens will have up to 2,500 dimming zones, meaning the LEDs will be controlled in clusters of 12 rather than individually. It still will not deliver the deep blacks of OLED, where each pixel self-illuminates. Nor will it match microLED tech, where the diodes are so small they can be assigned to the pixels on a 1:1 basis. But it should be easier to mass produce than either. That, in turn, should mean consumers get better quality reproduction of HDR (high dynamic range)-formatted content than was possible at a lower price point than the other two technologies. HDR allows TVs to display more vivid, life-like images and more striking special effects by taking advantage of modern televisions' higher peak-brightness limits. HDR is typically more noticeable to consumers than the shift to higher-resolution 4K or 8K formats. LG has yet to announce what it will charge for its new screens, but TCL sells its entry-level 55in R635 mini-LED set for $699 (£510). One expert said that at a time when the pandemic has caused people to spend more time at home watching TV, the industry is keen to convince families to upgrade. ""More people are trying to recreate a cinema experience at home,"" said Stuart Miles, founder of the Pocket-lint gadget review site. ""And that appetite will only grow as streaming services, like Disney+ or HBO Max in the States, release films on their platforms at the same time as or instead of at the cinema - plus you have the Olympics next year too. ""So TV-makers want to be able to promise a better experience beyond just having bigger screens, and that's easier to do if they can market themselves as offering a new technology."" CES runs from 11 to 14 January in 2021 and should feature a range of new televisions and other gadgets from manufacturers large and small.",LG has confirmed plans to launch its first TVs based on Mini-LED technology.

Users had complained that this was inaccurate bearing in mind it was being shown in the early hours of the morning and the issue was continuing. Argos said it was an intermittent problem that might take time to solve. The company - which is owned by the Milton Keynes-based Home Retail Group - said that its site was currently working, but might face further issues. ""Following planned maintenance to our website and apps, we have been experiencing some technical issues which means customers may have limited access to our website at intermittent periods,"" a spokeswoman told the BBC. ""We are really sorry for any inconvenience caused. Serving customers is our absolute priority and are pulling out all of the stops to fix the problem as soon as possible."" She said the site had only been offline to all customers for ""just over half a day"" on Tuesday morning. The firm had used social media to apologise for the problem, but unless customers searched for the posts they would not have been aware of them since more recent marketing tweets were embedded into the ""fault"" page. The spokeswoman said the failure to properly explain the problem on the page was in itself ""caused by a technical issue which is currently being fixed"". One retail expert said it was not unusual for website updates to create glitches, but suggested the company should have explained the issue more clearly.

"A notice on the Japanese firm's site says ""manufacturing of the Nintendo 3DS family of systems has ended"". The device had the ability to trick the human eye into seeing 3D images like those in some cinema screenings - but without special glasses. However, its launch received a lukewarm reception and it only gained popularity later. The console's demise has long been expected. Last year, the company said it no longer planned to make any new first-party games for the system. It means the original Nintendo DS retains the title of being the bestselling mobile console. And the Nintendo Switch - a hybrid handheld-and-home machine - is the current focus of Nintendo's efforts. Glasses-free 3D The unique selling point of the 3DS was its stereoscopic 3D effect coming from the screen itself, turned on with a simple slider. The optical illusion only works when the screen is in a very specific spot in front of the face - but exactly where gamers tend to hold handheld consoles. It was impossible to showcase on video or photo but impressed many who tried it. In its 2011 review, game site IGN wrote: ""Once you're in the 3D sweet spot... the 3DS looks amazing; graphics look clean, characters and objects are sharp, and ghosting effects are limited, creating a rich, immersive gameplay experience unlike anything we've seen on a handheld before."" The console was packed with experimental features - augmented reality games, dual 3D cameras, and the the ability to detect nearby consoles while in low-power standby, called ""Streetpass"" - which allowed players to connect with strangers without exchanging any information. ""The 3DS and its StreetPass functionality were driving factors for the founding of many of the groups now found in [Nintendo Players UK],"" said player John Edwards. ""Without the 3DS I doubt we'd have such a thriving community."" Slow starter Despite all the bells and whistles, the 3DS did not start well. A high asking price for the time of over £200, coupled with a lacklustre list of initial games, hurt sales. The fact that the key feature of 3D had to be tried in person was another obstacle. On top of that, some users reported that the 3D effect made them feel sick. Nintendo even advises to this day that children under six should not use the facility as it could cause vision damage. Within six months of the launch, Nintendo announced a major price cut to between £100 and £150. Coupled with more games - including a beloved remake of the classic Ocarina of Time - the fortunes of the handheld started to change. In 2012, a new version with a larger screen was launched, and Nintendo debuted digital downloads of games for the first time. That online store allowed Nintendo to re-release many of its best-loved classics on the handheld. ""It became a fantastic Nintendo machine for legacy content,"" recalls games writer Nathan Ellingsworth. ""It was how I experienced Majora's Mask, Earthbound, Minish Cap and many more for the first time and it had its own steady stream of incredible titles."" Making the switch The 3DS quickly came into its own, with dedicated Mario titles and new Pokemon games in addition to its growing back catalogue. It was revamped and relaunched several times - on top of the ""XL"" models, the ""New 3DS"" had increased horsepower, while the 2DS dropped the standout 3D feature entirely for those who saw it as a gimmick. By June 2020, the entire system family had sold nearly 76 million units, Nintendo says - far outclassing its home console of the same era, the WiiU, which sold less than 14 million. But the modern Nintendo Switch, released in 2017, has already sold more than 60 million units, and can be played as a handheld. While Nintendo initially insisted it was not a ""replacement"" for the 3DS, declining support and sales meant the venerable handheld's time was limited. In the year to March 2020, only 69,000 3DS consoles were sold.",Nintendo has discontinued its 3DS handheld after about 76 million sales over a nine-and-a-half year period.
"By Zoe KleinmanTechnology reporter Co-founder Karin Sode told BBC News an entire database had been stolen by hackers and included information on previous customers. Data stolen included names, addresses, dates of birth, phone numbers, tariff and energy meter IDs, she said. But with the exception of that of 15 small-business customers, no financial information had been accessed. Those businesses' bank accounts and sort codes had been accessed, Ms Sode said. And they had been contacted separately by phone. Phishing attacks Most of those affected are unlikely to face any direct financial risk. But having their data stolen may leave them more vulnerable to phishing attacks - where a criminal pretends to be from an official source to try to obtain other information, often using what they already have to sound credible. The breach was discovered on Wednesday morning. And People's Energy has contacted the Information Commissioner's Office, the National Centre for Cyber-Security, the energy regulator Ofgem and the police. 'Big blow' Based in Edinburgh, the company also has customers in England and Wales. Ms Sode said it was investigating the breach and had called in independent experts but so far had no information about the identity of the hackers.

"Gillian Brockell wrote to Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Experian, saying if they were smart enough to deduce she had been pregnant, they should have realised her baby had died. Other internet users have remarked that they have had similar experiences. Facebook and Twitter have acknowledged they could do better. 'Heartbroken' Washington DC-based Ms Brockell posted a message to Twitter last month to share the news that her son had died in the womb. She suggested that the technology companies should have picked up on this or other online activity resulting from her son's death. Instead, she said, the companies remained focused on her earlier pregnancy-related posts and actions. ""Did you not see the three days of silence, uncommon for a high-frequency user like me?"" she wrote. ""And then the announcement with keywords like 'heartbroken' and 'problem' and 'stillborn' and the 200 teardrop emoticons from my friends? Is that not something you could track?"" She added that when she had tried to actively discourage the technology companies from showing her the pregnancy-related promotions, they had misinterpreted her response. ""When we... click 'I don't want to see this ad,' and even answer your 'Why?' with the cruel-but-true 'It's not relevant to me,' do you know what your algorithm decides? ""It decides you've given birth, assumes a happy result, and deluges you with ads for the best nursing bras... tricks to get the baby to sleep through the night... and the best strollers to grow with your baby. ""And then, after all that, Experian swoops in with the lowest tracking blow of them all: a spam email encouraging me to 'finish registering your baby' (I never 'started' but sure) to track his credit throughout the life he will never lead."" 'Working on it' Facebook's advertising chief, Rob Goldman, has been the first of the executives responsible to respond. He apologised for Ms Brockell's experience but noted that the platform's settings included an option to block ads about topics the user might find painful, including parenting. ""It still needs improvement, but please know that we're working on it,"" he added. Ms Brockell thanked him for his reply but said the solution was not ideal. She later added that even after she had taken the suggested measure, she was still shown an advert that suggested she consider adoption, which was inappropriate given the circumstances. Other users have also reported that Facebook's Hide Ad Topics setting does not always have the desired effect. Last month, an English mother of a stillborn girl wrote an open letter to the social network after she told it to hide parenting ads as well as anything related to babies, family and the home. She said she had still been targeted with baby-related products. ""Your ads were unintentionally taunting me with reminders of what I'd lost,"" she wrote. Facebook told the BBC this had been caused by a bug in its system that had since been fixed. Twitter has also issued a brief statement. ""We cannot imagine the pain of those who who have experienced this type of loss,"" it said. ""We are continuously working on improving our advertising products to ensure they serve appropriate content to the people who use our services."" The BBC understands Experian plans to comment later after it has spoken directly to Ms Brockell.",The mother of a stillborn child has called on tech companies to rethink how they target ads after she was inundated with baby-related promotions.
"By Tom EspinerTechnology reporter The cable firm will send letters this week inviting a selection of its UK customers to download and test the TV and movie on-demand app. Those participating in the pilot will need a Netflix subscription to be able to view the content. Virgin Media said it planned to roll out the app to all of its 1.7 million Tivo customers by the end of the year. The BBC understands that Virgin may offer Netflix as part of a bundled service. The tie-up could strengthen the position of both companies, according to one media analyst. ""It's a win-win situation,"" said Toby Syfret from Enders Analysis. ""It's a positive move for both, and should help them in any competitive tussles they've got."" On-demand competition Virgin Media would benefit from being able to offer a broader range of content, and Netflix would potentially gain a larger UK audience, suggested Mr Syfret. Virgin's digital set-top competitors include Sky, BT and TalkTalk. Netflix is up against established services such as Amazon's Lovefilm and Tesco's Blinkbox. It also faces competition from a more recent entrant, Wuaki.tv. The new business is currently offering its service at half the price of Netflix's. It is owned by the Japanese e-commerce giant Rakuten which is best known in the UK for its ebook brand Kobo. Virgin Media has previously shown its willingness to create a partnership with what might be seen as a competing service. The company struck a deal in August to offer BT's sports channels to its cable customers.","Virgin Media is to pilot Netflix's video-streaming service with 40,000 of its Tivo set-top box subscribers."
"Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent@BBCRoryCJon Twitter The regulator is very familiar to the businesses which compete in the UK's communications markets, less so to consumers. But its new boss would like to change that. Sharon White, who is soon to make a momentous decision about competition in broadband, believes Ofcom needs to do more to show consumers that is on their side as they battle through the complexity of choosing services which are now vital to their working and social lives. Today's launch of a home wifi checker app is one way the regulator wants to show that it is helping consumers - though whether being told to turn their router on and off again or move it away from the fairy-lights will really impress them is open to question. Far more serious for our broadband future is Ofcom's decision on whether BT's Openreach division should be split off from the rest of the company. Rival suppliers and some consumer groups argue that is the only way of getting the UK's broadband strategy back on track, while BT insists it would harm, not help, its investment programme. Ms White, a high-flying Treasury civil servant before she arrived at Ofcom, is used to making these kind of decisions, though not under quite the same spotlight. When I interviewed her she told me that Ofcom was still examining all options - but suggested that she was minded to act rather than let things carry on as before: "" I think there will be change,"" she tells me. ""We're looking at a number of options, but I think it is very unlikely we will conclude that the status quo which has worked over the last 10 years is where we are likely to be over the next decade."" It is also evident that she has been listening to some of the criticism of BT - she talks about issues of access and availability of broadband and quality of service: ""It's taking a bit too long for repairs to be made, for connections to be linked in after people have requested those."" She promises that Ofcom will press BT and its rivals on behalf of consumers on issues such as broadband advertising and the ability to switch providers. Overall, the regulator thinks the UK is doing pretty well in rolling out superfast broadband compared with other European countries. But it points to two groups that are losing out - rural homes and small businesses. The most startling figure in its Connected Nations report is that half of all small firms in areas like business parks cannot even get speeds of 10Mbps, the bare minimum recently promised to everyone by the government by 2020. In the rush to wire up residential streets, it seems the business parks have been bypassed. Small firms ask what incentive there is for BT to link them up en masse, when it is far more lucrative to get individual businesses to sign up for a leased line. Now, it is still far from certain that Ofcom's Sharon White will recommend that Openreach is split off - and the digital minister Ed Vaizey has already indicated that the government is sceptical about such radical action. But BT knows that it is now under the microscope of a regulator determined to prove that it is the consumer's friend.","It's a very powerful force in determining the future shape of communications in the UK, but how many people know anything about Ofcom?"
"The firm said that the game's map was more than twice the size of that in the sci-fi franchise's last two entries combined. It also promised ""more complex visual effects"" than before on its forthcoming Xbox Series X console. However, some gamers voiced disappointment on social media at the quality of the graphics shown within the demo. This may in part be down to the art style of Halo Infinite, and the live stream being broadcast in high definition at 1080p. A trailer uploaded soon afterwards in 4K showed the detail and lighting to much better effect. There was a more positive response to the addition of new weapons, which included a grappling hook as well as a futuristic automatic pistol. Microsoft is also promoting the game's fast-loading times on the new console - a feature Sony also made much of at its recent PlayStation 5 event. ""There's a huge community around Halo, people really love Master Chief, but it also reaches a wider audience with people who may not finish the story, but spend hours in multiplayer,"" commented Ellen Rose, presenter of the Outside Xtra gaming show. ""If Xbox nails it, it could really help shift sales of the new Xbox Series X."" Microsoft also confirmed another of its big name franchises would come to the new console in the form of Forza Motorsport 8. It was described as being in the early stages of its development, so is unlikely to be released alongside the device. Other games unveiled included: Microsoft also showcased Tell Me Why from France's Dontnod Entertainment studio, which previously released Life Is Strange. It is notable for featuring what the developers have said is the first playable transgender lead in a major release. The trailer showed Tyler and his twin sister Alyson seeing ghosts of their past selves in a story that centres on exploring mysteries about their mother and childhood. Despite the decision to break new ground, the footage shown did not make specific mention of Tyler's gender identity. Over the current generation of games machines, the Xbox One comes third in terms of global sales, behind Sony's PlayStation 4 and Nintendo's Switch. But one expert said it had fared much better in terms of market share in the UK. ""There's a love for the Halo brand among UK consumers, and their tastes are generally more aligned with the US [where the gap is also closer],"" commented Piers Harding-Rolls from Ampere Analysis. ""So, I expect it to be pretty close between the two next-generation platforms here. But when you look at continental Europe and other global markets, the disparity is likely to be significantly in the PlayStation 5's favour."" Both Sony and Microsoft have invested in exclusive content by acquiring third-party games studios in recent years. However, they are now pursuing different strategies. Sony plans to release several of its new games only on the PlayStation 5. By contrast, Microsoft generally intends to launch its forthcoming first-party titles on both PCs and the new Xbox Series X, and often the existing Xbox One as well. As yet, neither company has revealed how much their new consoles will cost, despite both being set to go on sale before the end of 2020. They may both be holding off in the hope the other will go first, allowing the second party to tweak their strategy accordingly. However, Mr Harding-Rolls suggested the companies would be wise not to wait for too long, ""The coronavirus has created pressure on spending, so I think there would be an advantage to giving people the ability to pre-order,"" he said. 'A firmer footing' Analysis by Marc Cieslak, BBC Click What is the next generation all about, beyond better graphics and speedy loading times? It's a question I've been asking to every developer and games industry executive I've spoken to for the last year. So far, I'm yet to receive a response that fully answers the question. After a shaky first showcase from Xbox back in May, calling in back-up from Halo's Master Chief at this latest event put the Series X console on a firmer footing. In comparison to Sony's online shock-and-awe showing last month, Xbox opted for a slick and classy event. Halo Infinite and Forza Motorsport used tried and tested Xbox franchises to demonstrate the new machine will be a force to be reckoned with. To me, this event was far more reminiscent of the atmosphere and feel of Xbox's recent E3 showcases. A grown-up affair, which highlighted a wide diversity of games from crowd-pleasing first-person shooters and racing titles to more thoughtful fare like Tell Me Why, a platform-exclusive game with a trans lead character. They even found time to tease a new Fable too. It looks like Xbox is more than ready for the challenge of yet another scrap with PlayStation. But consumer expectation for the next-generation's capabilities should probably be tempered, until we get a first hand look at games playing on next-gen machines, rather than making a judgement based on an online promo stream.",Microsoft has given gamers a first look at Halo Infinite's gameplay.

But it said it could offer a better alternative to 3G networks for those who crave data on the move. ""We are looking at way to converge data services. 3G networks are reaching a capacity crunch and wi-fi could offload traffic and offer a vastly superior overall throughput,"" said a Virgin Media spokesman.

The Virgin spokesman described it as a ""useful experiment"" and said people were using it ""in preference to 3G"". Virgin Media has been watching developments in the US and the example of firms such as Cablevision which has launched a wi-fi network in New York.

"Cloudflare helps websites deliver content faster but some of its clients are known to host illegal content. The company insists it is powerless because it does not actually host the offending sites. Campaigners say Cloudflare's services make it easier for clients to avoid detection by ""hiding"" their locations. 'Abusive images' The anti-child-abuse campaign Battling Against Demeaning & Abusive Selfie Sharing claims to have first made the internet company aware of numerous indecent images, including some showing child sexual abuse, on three of its clients' websites over a year ago. The websites in question reportedly state any takedown notice would be ignored. And one allegedly allows users to search through a catalogue of abusive images. Following a Twitter campaign, Cloudflare director of trust and safety Justin Paine asked the charity send a detailed report of its complaint. ""We hope that by making noise, we will finally receive a response from Cloudflare. We're hopeful that they will end their relationship with these sites that profit off the exploitation of non-consenting women and and girls,"" charity advocate Emily Wilson told the BBC. ""All of our efforts have made no difference, and we are now publicizing our efforts to get some public pressure."" Piracy complaint Cloudflare states on its website offensive content can be reported through a form, the details of which may then be shared with law enforcement officials if the complaint is deemed legitimate. BBC News has contacted Cloudflare for comment. It is not the first time the company has had to defend itself against claims it makes the takedown of illegal content tougher. The internet giant hit back at the Motion Picture Association earlier this month after the American film body included it in a piracy complaint lodged with the US government.

Earlier this year, Cloudflare released a statement confirming it had terminated its services to 8chan, an internet forum used to celebrate mass shootings and spread so-called ""manifestos"". It had previously pulled its services from neo-Nazi website The Daily Stormer. Losing Cloudflare's protection made 8chan vulnerable to a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, whereby a website is bombarded with traffic that overwhelms its servers, rendering it inaccessible.

"Dave LeeNorth America technology reporter A team of researchers found 17 vulnerabilities, eight of which it described as ""critical"". The researchers warned of so-called ""panic attacks"", where an attacker could manipulate emergency systems to create chaos in communities. The specific flaws uncovered by the team have been patched. “If someone, supervillain or not, were to abuse vulnerabilities like the ones we documented in smart city systems, the effects could range from inconvenient to catastrophic,” wrote Daniel Crowley, from IBM’s cyber research division, X-Force Red. ""While no evidence exists that such attacks have taken place, we have found vulnerable systems in major cities in the US, Europe and elsewhere.” The team plans to explain the vulnerabilities at Black Hat - a cyber-security conference - on Thursday. It warned that a hacker could manipulate emergency systems to remove protections designed to protect or warn citizens about catastrophic events, creating a ""panic attack"". Hawaii false alarm A taster of what might occur came in January this year, when an alert warning Hawaiians of a missile attack was mistakenly sent out. In that instance, it was poor design of the system, coupled with human error, that created hysteria lasting around 38 minutes. That incident prompted the X-Force Red team, along with cyber-security start-up Threatcare, to launch a probe looking at smart city defences. They apparently weren’t the only ones. During the course of the team’s research, they found details of a flaw that an unknown hacker had discovered and seemingly inadvertently posted online. “They tried to keep it for themselves,” Mr Crowley told the BBC. ""They appear to have failed. [But] it tells us that there are other people looking at these things, and not so that they can get them fixed. ""What they're doing with them, I don't know. But we're not the only ones looking.” US director of national intelligence Dan Coats warned last month that the country was seeing daily cyber-attacks from Russia, China, Iran and North Korea. “The warning lights are blinking red,” he said, adding that infrastructure targets were a focus for all four countries. No choice The team behind this latest research focused on three companies that make hardware for smart cities: Libelium, Echelon and Battelle. All three were receptive to the team’s discoveries, Mr Crowley said. The researchers are now calling on city administrators to bring in outside expertise to test and assess the security of smart systems. Threatcare’s Jennifer Savage told the BBC she felt politicians should be mindful of the fact that citizens are not given an individual choice over which of these technologies they use. “In my own home I can choose not to have an [Amazon] Alexa if I want, I can choose not to have all these 'internet of things' devices - or I can choose very carefully which ones I want to trust. ""But when I walk outside my door and I'm in the city, suddenly I'm surrounded by choices other people have made for me."" She added: “As a security researcher I would like more input into what's getting deployed in my own city and the ability to review it and feel secure about the decisions that my city is making.""

"In an official statement, Iran's net regulator said swapping images and videos via the service was no longer permitted. It said the move was likely to affect the ""quality"" of the app in the country. Iran's move follows continuing attempts by Russia to restrict use of the messaging system. National safeguards Iran telecoms officials said Telegram's licence to site its servers in the country had been revoked and this meant the servers had to be moved outside Iran's borders and all in-bound traffic must now be routed through Iran's government-controlled net gateways. Telegram has yet to confirm that the blocks are in place or whether it has moved its technical infrastructure out of Iran. Telegram is believed to have about 50 million users in Iran and the app is popular because the way it scrambles messages makes it much harder for security services to scrutinise their contents. Iran's government has long been critical of Telegram and has said its use was behind a lot of anti-establishment protests in the nation. Earlier this week Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, shut down his Telegram channel, saying that this would help ""safeguard the national interest"". BBC Monitoring reports that this move was widely seen as a precursor to an outright ban. Government workers and officials have also all been told to stop using the messaging app. Instead, Iranians are being urged to use an alternative home-grown app called Soroush. In mid-April Russian net regulators blocked use of Telegram after the company refused to hand over encryption keys that would have let security services read messages. The wide-ranging ban has also hit other services that Telegram was using to ensure the app stayed available. Cloud services from Google and Amazon were among those knocked out.",Iran has started to disrupt the way that people can use the popular Telegram messaging app.

""We will continue to divert any new admissions, other than those that are critical, to other facilities,"" DCH said in its statement. Local ambulances have been asked to take patients to other local hospitals instead, where possible. Outpatients with appointments at any of the three hospitals were advised to call before attending them. However, elective procedures and surgery already scheduled for 2 October were planned to go ahead. It is not yet known what group or individual launched the ransomware. Australian hospitals struck Separately, seven hospitals in Australia have also reported disruptive ransomware infections. ""Some elective surgery and appointments have been cancelled,"" said Barwon Health, one hospital operator affected by the incident. The Government of Victoria said the seven hospitals were located in Gippsland and south-west Victoria. Multiple computer systems have had to be disconnected as a result, which has meant some patient record, booking and management services have been shut down. This could affect efforts to contact patients and schedule appointments, the Government of Victoria said: ""Where practical, hospitals are reverting to manual systems to maintain their services."" In cases where patient histories, charts, images and other information has been made unavailable, it may be necessary to reschedule some appointments, the authority added. Daniel Andrews, Premier of Victoria, told local media it could take ""weeks"" before the problems were fixed. The Victorian Government Cyber Incident Response Service has dealt with more than 600 cyber-attacks since July 2018. ""Unfortunately the groups breaking into individual computers at organisations are becoming rapidly better at obtaining access across networks, and then causing chaos with a goal to being paid,"" said UK-based cyber-security expert Kevin Beaumont. ""This problem isn't going to go away,"" he added. He said organisations needed to review their security procedures and ensure that backups were in place - and also that such backups had been recently tested - so that data and systems could be restored in the event of a ransomware infection.","Three US hospitals have been forced to temporarily close their doors to ""all but the most critical new patients"" following a ransomware outbreak."
"The firm has changed its policy for apps to allow software developers to use ""approved virtual currencies"". Apple has yet to publish a list of which virtual currencies it considers to be ""approved"". Many have taken this to mean that the Bitcoin cyber-cash system will soon be included in Apple apps as it is the most widely used virtual currency. The policy change marks a significant shift for Apple, which before now has been aggressive in its policing of apps that use virtual currencies. In late 2013 and early 2014 Apple took action against apps that used virtual cash even though many of the programs had been available on the store for months. Some apps removed virtual currency code from their program so they could stay on the store but others were forced out altogether. Gliph, CoinJar, Coinbase, Blockchain and other apps were all affected by the action. By contrast, Google has had a much more open policy, and there are now many Android apps that support different virtual currencies. Gliph developer Rob Banagale told the Bloomberg news service that he was now planning to submit a new version of his app to Apple that restored its ability to send and receive payments in bitcoins. Virtual currencies are built around shared software that generates or ""mines"" coins by getting lots of computers to carry out complicated mathematical operations. Apple's decision comes as satellite TV firm Dish says it will accept payments made in bitcoins. In addition, the value of one bitcoin has been steadily rising in recent weeks. In late November 2013 each bitcoin was briefly worth about $1,000 (£596) but the value collapsed soon after. Current exchange rates suggest each one is now worth about $650.","Apps accepting payments made with virtual currencies, such as Bitcoin, could soon appear in Apple's app store."
"By Mark WardTechnology correspondent, BBC News Just one example serves to show just how prolific they are. Every day, come rain or shine, they crank out about 250,000 novel variants of viruses. Their vigour has helped them steal data from some really big companies, Target, Home Depot and eBay, in the last few months. And, what is a problem for the big companies is even more acute for the smaller firms. They have an even tougher time keeping the bad guys out. ""They are exposed to many of the same attacks as much larger enterprises, yet they don't have the security expertise and resources available to those larger firms,"" said Maxim Weinstein, a security advisor at security firm Sophos. While attacks on the eBays and Sonys of the world make the headlines there's no doubt that smaller firms are getting hit. And getting hit hard. Figures from Sophos suggest about 30,000 websites a day are being compromised by cyber bad guys - most of those will be the public face of one SME or others. Becoming a victim of a hack or breach costs smaller firms between £65,000 and £115,000, according to the PWC survey of the worst data breaches among small firms. Those worst hit will suffer up to six breaches a year, PWC suggested, so the total cost could be even higher. For a smaller firm finding that much cash to clean up after a breach could mean the difference between keeping trading and going bust. This lack of focus on cyber security is understandable, said Mr Weinstein, as most small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) spent most of their time on core commercial activity such as keeping customers happy, seeking out new clients and engaging in all the basic day-to-day admin needed to keep their enterprise afloat. Worrying about computer security comes a long down their To Do lists, he said. Cyber commerce But they do need to worry because the nature of commerce in the 21st century means that there are relatively few SMEs that do not make heavy use of technology, said Steven Harrison, lead technologist at IT services firm Exponential-e. ""You do see a knowledge gap,"" he said ""in that you have these smaller companies that are smaller in terms of people and revenue but they are not smaller in terms of the IT they use."" Ecommerce, websites, apps, smartphones, tablets, social media and cloud services were all now standard ways of doing business in the 21st century, he said. And, he added, there were some SMEs that were based entirely around technology but that did not make them experts in how to keep their digital business secure. ""There are some businesses that are much more than just users of technology,"" he said. ""They have huge computing requirements as well as massive storage and bandwidth requirements - far more than their head count would suggest."" Either way, he said, everyone is a target and they all need to look externally to security firms for help. ""In the same way they don't run your own bank or accountancy firm they shouldn't run their own security operation,"" he said adding that SMEs often need help to understand the sheer range of threats arrayed against them. Everyone is familiar with attempts to penetrate internal networks to steal payment information or customer data records but may be less knowledgeable about invoice fraud, ransomware, malvertising, or even attacks that ""scrape"" websites with automated tools to steal all the information about prices and products they contain. Cash question And that was where they hit their first problem, he said. How much do they spend? Estimates vary on how much SMEs spend on IT security. The most recent government figures published 18 months ago suggest SMEs with 100 or more employees spend about £10,000 per year. The smallest small firms, with less than 20 staff, spend about £200. Other estimates put the spend at about £30 per employee. Mr Weinstein from Sophos said SMEs should start with the basics. This includes anti-virus software, firewalls, spam filters on email gateways and keeping devices up to date. This, he said, would defeat the majority of the low level threats that those busy cyber thieves are churning out. Government advice on how SMEs can be safer revolves around a 10 steps programme that emphasises basic, good practice. It's big on those simple steps such as keeping software up to date and applying the widely used software tools that can spot and stop the most prolific threats. But it also stresses that smaller firms understand more about how they use data and how it flows around their organisation. This is important, said Greg Hanson from services firm Informatica, because security is no longer about setting up a fortress around your systems, servers and staff to keep the bad guys out. Now, he said, the way data flows between SMEs, their supply chains and customers has made it impossible to maintain the fortress-like security stance. Having a good sense of where data goes and who uses it can help limit the damage if it goes astray, he said. ""There's a proliferation of data flowing through organisations that really needs to be controlled better,"" he said. Having control of that data, knowing its value and where it is going, can help a company guard against it leaking out accidentally and maliciously. For instance, having that control might help a firm spot that a server was accidentally exposed to the net and private information was viewable by anyone. It can also help SMEs keep an eye on their suppliers and partners to ensure that data is handled appropriately. And finally, said Mr Harrison from Exponential-e, firms need to put in place a plan for what happens when a breach or security incident does occur. ""It's not a question of if something bad will happen,"" he said. ""It will, but it's all about what they do about it.""","Keeping cyber thieves at bay is hard. They are busy, well-motivated and well-financed."
"The Department of Justice acknowledged that one of its agents had created the page without telling Sondra Arquiett. But it initially suggested that Ms Arquiett had ""implicitly consented"" to the action because she had granted officers access to her mobile phone. The DoJ said it was now reviewing if the bogus page had been a step too far. A trial is scheduled for next week in New York, with the US government and the Drugs Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent, Timothy Sinnigen, both named as defendants. The case dates back four years, but was first reported by the news site Buzzfeed. Pictures of children The fake Facebook page was created after restaurant waitress Ms Arquiett was arrested in July 2010, and accused of being involved in a drugs ring. She pleaded guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine, and was later sentenced to six months of weekend incarceration. At the time of her arrest, Ms Arquiett surrendered her mobile phone and consented to officers accessing its data to help them with related criminal investigations. This included an investigation into her boyfriend, Jermaine Branford, who was suspected of co-ordinating drug sales. He later pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute cocaine. Ms Arquiett said she was not, however, notified that this operation would involve the creation of a ""publicly available"" Facebook page in the name of Sondra Prince, an alias she used. It included photographs of her as well as images of her son and niece. One photograph, her lawyers said, featured ""the plaintiff in her bra and panties"". ""When plaintiff learned of Sinnigen's actions, she suffered fear and great emotional distress because, by posing as her on Facebook, Sinnigen had created the appearance that plaintiff was wilfully co-operating in his investigation of the narcotics trafficking ring, thereby placing her in danger,"" they added. Ms Arquiett said the action had breached her rights to privacy, equal protection under the law and due process, and has demanded more than $250,000 (£155,560) in damages. The US government acknowledged that Mr Sinnigen had created the page and had used it to send a ""friend"" request to a wanted fugitive as well as accepting requests from others, but denied it had been made ""publicly available"" in a wider sense. However, Buzzfeed and the Associated Press news agency were both able to access the page before it was taken offline. The US government also recognised that one of the photos included showed Ms Arquiett ""wearing either a two-piece bathing suit or a bra and underwear,"" but denied that the photograph should be characterised as being ""suggestive"". 'Laughable' Regarding the wider allegation, the US government stated that Ms Arquiett had ""relinquished any expectation of privacy she may have had to photographs on her cell phone"" when she agreed to let officers search and use information on the device. However, it acknowledged that she ""did not give express permission for the use of photographs contained on her phone on an undercover Facebook page"". The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), a US-based online privacy campaign group, has described the government's rationale as being ""laughable"". But legal experts have said that the case might hang on exactly what Ms Arquiett had consented to. Facebook's terms and conditions state that users cannot create accounts for others without permission, but a spokeswoman for the firm declined to comment on this specific instance.","A woman is suing the US government after it created a fake Facebook page containing photos of her, including one that showed her half-clothed."
"The machine has been dubbed a MacGyver Bot, after the TV character who cobbled together devices to escape life-threatening situations. The challenge is to develop software that ""understands"" what objects are in order to deduce how they can be used. The US Navy is funding the project and says the machines might ultimately be deployed alongside humans. It is providing $900,000 (£562,000) to robotics researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology to carry out the work. ""Our goal is to develop a robot that behaves like MacGyver, the television character from the 1980s who solved complex problems and escaped dangerous situations by using everyday objects and materials he found at hand,"" said project leader Prof Mike Stilman. ""Researchers in the robot motion planning field have traditionally used computerised vision systems to locate objects in a cluttered environment to plan collision-free paths, but these systems have not provided any information about the objects' functions."" Rescue bot Mr Stilman said he planned to create software that first identified an object, then determined potential things that could be done with it, before turning it into ""a simple machine"" that could be used to complete an action. Examples given include stacking boxes to climb over something, building a bridge out of debris or climbing on a chair to grab an object out of reach. By the project's end, the software should be able to combine such tasks when necessary. To test whether this is the case, the researchers hope to load the code onto Golem Krang - a robot already developed by Mr Stillman's laboratory - to see if it works in action. The researchers ultimately envisage a situation in which the machine might be deployed to rescue trapped officers without needing to risk anyone else's life. Perception problem One UK-based artificial intelligence (AI) researcher said the challenge was harder that it sounded. ""For example, vision alone is not enough to tell you if an object can support your weight or be used as a lever - you need to interact with it physically to understand its physical possibilities,"" Prof Barbara Webb, from the University of Edinburgh's School of Informatics, told the BBC. ""This is probably a harder problem for current robotics than making a plan to solve the task."" Another AI expert suggested the project might like to draw on existing research into how animals use tools. ""A monkey will use a stick to reach a longer stick to reach an out-of-reach banana,"" said Noel Sharkey, professor of artificial intelligence and robotics at the University of Sheffield. ""A crow will bend a piece of wire to get a trapped food. ""I have seen this kind of work with robots, but it is a very difficult project and like all research may not work as planned, but it is well worth the effort and will advance the field.""",A US team aims to build a robot that can work out how to use nearby objects to solve problems or escape threats.
"By Zoe KleinmanTechnology reporter, BBC News Many say they have spent hundreds of pounds on Sonos speaker products for their homes over the years. Newer Sonos products connected with the older ones will also be left out of future updates. The change affects four models sold between 2006 and 2015, including the Connect:Amp and Connect. Without the updates, they will eventually lose functionality. Access to other services will also become limited. Sonos said the hardware had been ""stretched to its technical limits in terms of memory and processing power"". And affected customers can upgrade to a newer device with a 30% discount in return for recycling the old product. But the news has annoyed many Sonos owners. Richard Street told the BBC he had spent £1,000 ($1,300) on two Play 5 speakers. Even with the upgrade discount he believes it would cost him around £700 to replace them. ""This is money my family and I just don't have,"" he said. ""There is a feeling among the community that if Sonos gets away with this then they will do the same with all kit over time."" Sonos told BBC News 92% of the products it had ever shipped were still in use. BBC technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones tweeted it was ""very poor marketing and damaging for the brand"". Sonos's share price fell slightly following the announcement, closing at $14.80, down from a high of $15.05.",Owners of Sonos products have reacted angrily to the firm's announcement that it will no longer issue software updates for its older devices from May.
"The security researchers involved have warned the problems pose risks to users' privacy and could be abused to prevent contagion alerts being sent. GCHQ's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) told the BBC it was already aware of most of the issues raised and is in the process of addressing them. But the researchers suggest a more fundamental rethink is required. Specifically, they call for new legal protections to prevent officials using the data for purposes other than identifying those at risk of being infected, or holding on to it indefinitely. In addition, they suggest the NHS considers shifting from its current ""centralised"" model - where contact-matching happens on a computer server - to a ""decentralised"" version - where the matching instead happens on people's phones. ""There can still be bugs and security vulnerabilities in either the decentralised or the centralised models,"" said Thinking Cybersecurity chief executive Dr Vanessa Teague. ""But the big difference is that a decentralised solution wouldn't have a central server with the recent face-to-face contacts of every infected person. ""So there's a much lower risk of that database being leaked or abused."" Health Secretary Matt Hancock said on Monday a new law ""is not needed because the Data Protection Act will do the job"". And NHSX - the health service's digital innovation unit - has said using the centralised model will both make it easier to improve the app over time and trigger alerts based on people's self-diagnosed symptoms rather than just medical test results. Varied risks The researchers detail seven different problems they found with the app. They include: ""The risks overall are varied,"" Dr Chris Culnane, the second author of the report, told BBC News. ""In terms of the registration issues, it's fairly low risk because it would require an attack against a well protected server, which we don't think is particularly likely. ""But the risk about the unencrypted data is higher, because if someone was to get access to your phone, then they might be able to learn some additional information because of what is stored on that."" NCSC technical director Ian Levy blogged thanking the two researchers for their work and promising to address the issues they identified. But he said it might take several releases of the app before all the problems were addressed. ""Everything reported to the team will be properly triaged (although this is taking longer than normal),"" he wrote. An NCSC spokesman said: ""It was always hoped that measures such as releasing the code and explaining decisions behind the app would generate meaningful discussion with the security and privacy community. ""We look forward to continuing to work with security and cryptography researchers to make the app the best it can be."" But Dr Culnane said politicians also needed to revisit the issue. ""I have confidence that they will fix the technical issues,"" he said. ""But there are broader issues around the lack of legislation protecting use of this data [including the fact] there's no strict limit on when the data has to be deleted. ""That's in contrast to Australia, which has very strict limits about deleting its app data at the end of the crisis."" Meanwhile, Harriet Harman, who chairs the Parliament's Human Rights Committee, announced she was seeking permission to introduce a private member's bill to limit who could use data gathered by the app and how and create a watchdog to deal with related complaints from the public. ""I personally would download the app myself, even if I'm apprehensive about what the data would be used for,"" the Labour MP told BBC News. ""But the view of my committee was that this app should not go ahead unless [the government] is willing to put in place the privacy protections.""",Wide-ranging security flaws have been flagged in the Covid-19 contact-tracing app being piloted in the Isle of Wight.
"By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor Fresh restrictions are also planned to govern their use of customers' data, and to prevent the firms ranking their own services above competitors' in search results and app stores. The measures are intended to overhaul how the EU regulates digital markets. Large fines and break-ups are threatened for non-compliance. It is proposed that if companies refuse to obey, they could be forced to hand over up to 10% of their European turnover. And ""recurrent infringers"" are warned that they could be made to divest ""certain businesses, where no other equally effective alternative measure is available to ensure compliance"". The two new laws involved - the Digital Services Act and the Digital Markets Act - have yet to be passed, so would only come into force after the Brexit transition period has ended. The UK's own regulator - the Competition and Markets Authority - announced its own plans to place limits on the tech giants last week, and ministers have just detailed how they plan to tackle online harms. The European Commission's press conference was scheduled for the afternoon to allow tech leaders on the US's West Coast to watch live, but began later than originally advised. Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager described the two laws as ""milestones in our journey to make Europe fit for the digital age... we need to make rules that put order into chaos"". Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton added that the laws had been designed to be applied ""very quickly"" once they came into effect. Online safety The focus of the Digital Services Act is to create a single set of rules for the EU to keep users safe online, protect their freedom of expression and help both them and local authorities hold tech companies to account. It introduces a sliding scale, under which firms take on more obligations the larger and more influential they are. So, for example, all internet companies must provide users with a way of getting in touch and the means to see their terms and conditions. The operators of online platforms - such as social media apps and video-sharing sites of any size - must prioritise complaints raised by ""trusted flaggers"", who have a track record of highlighting valid problems. Likewise, all online stores must be able to trace traders selling goods via their platforms, in case they are offering counterfeit items or other illegal products. ""[It] will require online marketplaces to check their sellers' identity before they are allowed on the platform, which will make it so much more difficult for dodgy traders to do their business,"" commented Mr Breton. But the biggest players must also subject themselves to further scrutiny, including an annual independent audit to check they are following the rules. In addition, once a year they must publish a report into their handling of major risks, including users posting illegal content, disinformation that could sway elections, and the unjustified targeting of minority groups. Suggested counter-measures include preventing abusive users earning money from ads, and checking moderator guidelines is kept up-to-date. Furthermore, the law specifies that local officials can send cross-border orders to make tech firms remove content or provide access to information, wherever their EU headquarter is based. A commission spokesman gave the example of Amsterdam's local government being able to ask a service like Airbnb, which is based in Dublin, to remove a listing of a non-registered apartment and share details about a host suspected of not paying taxes. Limited advantages The Digital Markets Act centres on the regulation of ""gatekeepers"" - those behind ""entrenched"" services that other businesses use to provide their own products. This covers the operators of search engines, social networks, chat apps, cloud computing services and operating systems, among others. They are likely to include Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft. The idea is to prevent the firms gaining unfair advantages via their elevated positions. The new rules include obligations to: The commission would be able to issue fines of up to 10% of a firm's annual turnover in Europe under the Digital Services Act, and 6% under the Digital Markets Act. Dated laws Facebook was one of the first to respond, saying it thought the laws were ""on the right track to help preserve what is good about the internet"". But it also took the opportunity to call attention to one of the other US tech giants. ""We hope the Digital Markets Act will set boundaries for Apple,"" said a spokesman. ""Apple controls an entire ecosystem from device to app store and apps, and uses this power to harm developers and consumers, as well as large platforms like Facebook."" Apple declined to respond. Google later sounded a more cautious note. ""We are concerned that [the laws] appear to specifically target a handful of companies and make it harder to develop new products to support small businesses in Europe,"" said Karan Bhatia, its vice president of government affairs. The DigitalEurope trade association also voiced concern about whether the commission had got the balance right between privacy and preventing harmful activities, but said it needed more time to read the details. The tech giants and digital rights campaigners are among those likely to try to influence their final shape of the two laws. But if passed, they should update current rules, which date back to 20 years ago when some of the tech firms affected did not exist. And they may influence other regulators - in the US and elsewhere - which are also planning to introduce new restrictions of their own.",Big tech firms face yearly checks on how they are tackling illegal and harmful content under new rules unveiled by the European Commission.
"The new feature was launched as regulators grapple with whether in-game wagers should be treated as gambling. In GTA Online, players can buy in-game ""dollars"" with real currency, and then convert their virtual dollars to gambling chips. The game is rated for ages 18 and over, but remains popular among young teens. The in-game currency can be used to acquire cars, weapons, and cosmetic items - and used to play slot machines, roulette, or poker. Some players reported that while they could walk around the casino area, the gambling tables were blocked in their country where gambling is illegal. Gamers had mixed reactions to the discovery that gambling chips can be purchased with real cash. Popular British streamer Broughy1322, who was showcasing the new content on Twitch said: ""They've done it, I can't believe they've done it,"" after finding that in-game dollars can be exchanged directly for chips. ""They've gone over the line of what they would, and it's a big problem that they allow you to buy chips with real money, frankly,"" he added later as viewers debated the system. Ahead of the launch, it was not clear if such an exchange would be possible. Gaming news site Kotaku speculated that chips would only be earned by playing the game - similar to the way it works in Rockstar's other recent online game, Red Dead, and in many other games. ""This way, players can't spend real money or win fake money that is worth real cash in the casino,"" it wrote. Chips can be spent on blackjack, poker, slot machines, video horse racing, roulette, or spent on furnishing a casino penthouse with a wide array of customisable items. Others gamers were excited by the update, which has been hinted at for about six years - and also contains an array of missions, story scenes, and new vehicles centred around the casino resort. The online mode was launched as an add-on to the popular game in 2013, and has always allowed players to top-up their in-game wallets with real money. The conversion rate in 2019 is roughly GTA$500,000 for £5.99 - with discounts for higher amounts purchased. There is also a limit on how many chips can be bought every hour in the new casino. But the fact that in-game gambling winnings cannot easily be converted back into real-world cash may be a key distinction for regulators. The UK gambling watchdog told MPs on Monday that it does not oversee the purchase of in-game content - like video game loot boxes - because there is no official way to monetise the winnings. A prize has to be either money or have monetary value in order for it to fall under gambling legislation, it told a parliamentary committee. However, a grey area exists in some games where a third-party ""black market"" operates, allowing players to gamble or sell the in-game items they win. Some examples include players earned through ""card packs"" in Fifa 19, or rare skins earned in shooter Counter-Strike. GTA items, meanwhile, are tied to a player's account, making it more difficult to sell than in some other games. ""Unlicensed and unauthorised secondary in-game item trading markets that abuse the terms and conditions of games are a scourge on the industry,"" commented Jo Twist, chief executive of the video games trade body Ukie. ""Companies take proactive measures to close them down, regularly working hand in hand with law enforcement agencies and regulators to safeguard players."" Rockstar has been contacted for comment.",Grand Theft Auto V has opened an in-game casino where real money can be spent on gambling chips - but they cannot be converted back into cash.
"The patents were assigned to the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe by technology company SRC Labs, and it will receive a share of any award. Tribal sovereignty means that the patents cannot be reviewed by the Patent Trial and Appeal Board. A similar deal has drawn criticism from US lawmakers, who claim it is a loophole to avoid patent scrutiny. Democratic US senator Claire McCaskill drafted a bill this month, in response to another attempt to transfer patents to the same tribe. In that case, it was pharmaceutical giant Allergan, and a patent for dry-eye medication. Ms McCaskill said at the time. ""Congress never imagined tribes would allow themselves to be used by pharmaceutical companies to avoid challenges to patents, and this bill will shut the practice down before others follow suit."" The tribe issued a statement questioning why the legislation targeted Native American tribes but not other sovereign governments or state universities. John Tothill, a partner at law firm Dehns, said the US appeal board was frequently used to revoke patents. ""Microsoft or Amazon could pre-empt this action by applying to have the patents revoked,"" he said. ""It is a way of playing the system, if you like, and trying to block potential litigation. ""I am assuming that passing the patents on like this stops that because the US federal government does not have rights over the sovereignty of Native Americans."" Neither Amazon nor Microsoft have responded to requests for comment.",A Native American tribe is suing Amazon and Microsoft for infringing data-processing patents it is holding.
"By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter It is the latest iteration of the futuristic footwear, first referred to in the film Back to the Future Part II, and made reality by Nike in 2016. The latest version, called Nike Adapt, will cost $350 and will not require a physical button to activate the laces. The launch event was hosted on live-streaming platform Twitch. ""We picked basketball as the first sport for Nike Adapt intentionally because of the demands that athletes put on their shoes,"" said Eric Avar, Nike's creative director of innovation. ""During a normal basketball game the athlete's foot changes and the ability to quickly change your fit by loosening your shoe to increase blood flow and then tighten again for performance is a key element that we believe will improve the athlete's experience."" Users can customise the fit and control it through a smartphone app which will store fit preferences. They can input different fit settings for different moments in the game, loosening it for a timeout and tightening before they re-enter the game. When they step into the shoe, a custom motor and gear will sense the tension needed by the foot and adjust accordingly. The app will also store the data, which athletes can choose to share with Nike. The shoe goes on sale in February. Michael Sawh, editor of wearable tech website Wareable said: ""Obviously this is a big nostalgic nod to the self-lacing shoes from Back to the Future that have now gone from movie prop to the real deal. When Nike teased these last year, there was a whole lot of buzz around them. I think there's going to be a lot of movie fans and Nike sneaker lovers that will want these in their collection. ""Whether a shoe that removes the needs for laces is necessary is definitely up for debate. I vividly remember back in 2012 when Nike launched a smart shoe designed for runners to record a host of different metrics. That didn't really stand the test of time and quietly disappeared. ""Nike says it's going to roll this technology out to other shoes in its range and that's where I think it could go from gimmick to actually being useful. Runners, for instance, need to make sure their shoes are well laced-up before going out for a run or a race."" Ben Wood, a mobile analyst from consultancy CCS Insight, said: ""For a long time we have predicted growth in smart footwear. It's a logical place to embed technology but the underlying incentive for shoemakers is that it offers the ability to get information on usage, performance and wear. ""As with any new technology category there are going to be concerns about how consumer data will be used but the sorts of metrics Nike is able to capture are arguably of a lot less concern than other smart devices that are doing constant measurements on health such as heart rate.""","Nike has launched self-lacing trainers, which fit themselves to the shape of the foot and are controlled via a smartphone."
"The button would give Google Search users the option to purchase without needing to visit a separate website. The company's chief business officer, Omid Kordestani, said he wanted to reduce ""friction"" for users so they buy more things online. Google faces significant competition from Amazon, where many people now begin their search to buy products. Revenue earner ""There's going to be a buy button. It's going to be imminent,"" said Mr Kordestani on stage at the Code Conference in California on Wednesday. The change would make it easier for shoppers to buy products featured in its shopping ads that appear alongside search results. Mr Kordestani also noted that about nine out of 10 purchases are still made offline. He added that the number of location-based searches to help users find something close to them had doubled in the past year. Mobile future Getting users to buy products as a result of searching is a key revenue earner for Google which currently charges retailers a premium to appear in a prominent position on the results page following a relevant search query. ""With Google Buy set to only be available on mobile devices and the search giant recently changing its algorithm to favour mobile optimised sites, it's clear Google believes that smartphones and tablets are the way forward for e-commerce,"" said Kevin Dallas from Worldpay eCommerce. ""This move from the world's biggest search engine might alarm some merchants but companies should see Google Buy as a positive, spurring retailers to acknowledge the benefits for consumers when they invest in making their site mobile optimised. ""Customers expect to be able to transact swiftly and safely from mobile devices and any company that hasn't done so will be swiftly outmanoeuvred by more nimble competitors."" Erosive But Google's move may also cause concern for retailers who are keen to maintain a close relationship with customers said one expert. Steve Mader of retail specialists, Kantar Retail told the BBC: ""Google enabling their product ads to be linked to an opportunity to buy without leaving its platform is a great step towards a more convenient product search solution."" ""What remains unclear is how this will impact the narrative retailers have with their shopper - a relationship retailers are hesitant to erode.

Google is making further announcements about most of its services and products at its I/O developers conference in San Francisco .","Google has confirmed that it is to introduce a ""buy button"" to its search results imminently."
"Dave LeeNorth America technology reporter Amazon had been considered the favourite to win the deal, worth $10bn over the next 10 years. The company, which already provides cloud computing to the US Central Intelligence Agency, said the decision was made due to political pressure. In July, President Donald Trump threatened to intervene after what he described as ""tremendous complaints"". Mr Trump had previously attacked Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos, owner of the Washington Post, which has been critical of his presidency. The Pentagon subsequently delayed its decision to award the contract until 25 October, when it was announced the work would be given to Microsoft. Defence Secretary Mark Esper said the competition was fair. ""I am confident it was conducted freely and fairly without any type of outside influence,"" he told reporters in the South Korean capital Seoul. The Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure project - known as JEDI - is designed to modernise the antiquated data and communication systems within the US military. The contract is considered to be particularly lucrative if other government departments follow the Defense Department's lead when upgrading their own systems. An Amazon spokesperson told the BBC: ""Amazon Web Services is uniquely experienced and qualified to provide the critical technology the US military needs, and remains committed to supporting the DoD's modernisation efforts. ""We also believe it's critical for our country that the government and its elected leaders administer procurements objectively and in a manner that is free from political influence. ""Numerous aspects of the JEDI evaluation process contained clear deficiencies, errors and unmistakable bias - and it's important that these matters be examined and rectified."" The BBC understands Amazon submitted its intention to protest against the decision to the Court of Federal Claims last Friday. The formal appeal itself will be filed at a later stage. Microsoft did not respond to requests for comment. Four companies had initially been in the running for the deal when the process was launched two years ago. IBM was eliminated, as was Oracle - which lodged an unsuccessful legal challenge alleging conflict of interest stemming from Amazon's hiring of two former Defense Department employees. Both were said to have been involved in the JEDI selection process. _____ Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC Do you have more information about this or any other technology story?

"Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent@BBCRoryCJon Twitter This week's Tech Tent explores how the biggest crisis in the social media company's history has unfolded - and asks what might happen next. Will Facebook really change its ways, or will regulators have to step in and make it be more transparent about how it uses our data? After all, according to one of our guests Emma Mulqueeny, it and other platforms ""utilised the easiest business model they could and closed their eyes and crossed their fingers that it would be too annoying, too complicated or too late by the time people started wanting to take control of their own data"". Some people have now decided to take to the courts to assert their rights over their own data. Among them is a US citizen, Prof David Carroll. He is taking Cambridge Analytica to court in the UK to get access to data he says it holds on him. The company, which acquired the Facebook profiles of 50 million people from an academic researcher, boasted in the past that it had 4,000-5,000 data points on just about every American citizen. Prof Carroll tells Tech Tent that this boast inspired him to demand his file but what he received from the company was ""alarming but not complete"", a model of the political beliefs he probably held and his likelihood to vote. Convinced that there must be far more data, he went to court to seek it - not in the United States but in the UK where the law is more friendly to this kind of case. With Europe's major new data protection law GDPR arriving in May we can expect more cases to cross the Atlantic. In the meantime, some people have decided the only answer is to get off Facebook - although. whether the fact that #deletefacebook has been trending says anything about the numbers actually leaving is open to doubt. And for many people in developing countries where Facebook is synonymous with the internet that will not look like a good option, But Marieme Jamme, a Senegal-born entrepreneur and founder of a movement which aims to give African girls skills in computing and technology, that is another reason why Facebook's power needs to be curbed. She tells us that governments across Africa have seen just how much influence the social network has and are spending big money to use it to try to swing elections. ""We open our doors to Facebook,"" she tells us. ""The average African spends six to seven hours on it, I'm not saying it's 100% bad but we need to regulate it and at the moment there is no regulation."" In Africa and elsewhere, there are now growing calls for Facebook's wings to be clipped. The coming weeks will show whether this really has been a lightbulb moment where two billion Facebook users wake up to the dangerous bargain they have struck with the social network - or whether they go on sharing their data with not a care in the world.",What have we learned this week about the dangers of sharing our lives on Facebook - and can we now take back control?
"By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor Three UK's chief executive told BBC News there would be enough capacity on 5G to cope with demand, meaning households would be able to save money by ending their fixed-line contracts. He predicts consumers will use 13 times as much mobile data in 2025 as today. But one expert warned against ""hype"". Three has said it intends to launch its first 5G services in the UK as soon as the middle of next year. Its announcement coincides with news from BT's mobile division, EE, that it has switched on nine 5G trial sites in London. Vodafone and Telefonica-owned O2 have also bought spectrum to launch 5G services of their own in the country. Higher capacity In theory, 5G could offer download speeds of up to 10 gigabits per second or even 20Gbps - although these are unlikely to be attained for many years if at all. Most handsets are not yet capable of pushing 4G speeds to their limits, so UK networks are under pressure to convince the public of the need to upgrade having spent more than had been predicted on the spectrum auctioned to date. As part of its pitch, Three is making the case that 5G will offer a ""genuine alternative"" to fixed-line copper and fibre services. ""Maybe not for the whole country, but certainly a significant majority of the country, I strongly believe 5G can offer a good enough home broadband experience for people to effectively ditch their copper [or fibre] connection,"" said David Dyson, Three UK's chief executive. ""The challenge in terms of why we can't do that today is that the mobile networks don't have the capacity with 3G or 4G. 5G changes all of that."" Capacity refers to the amount of data that can be handled at any one time rather than the speed. Three already provides a 4G-based ""unlimited data"" home broadband service in London, called Relish, which it acquired last year. But Mr Dyson said the business had to be careful how many people it signed up, to prevent its service degrading. This, he said, would not be a problem with 5G. But one industry-watcher said it was still unclear how reliable the technology would be. ""Stability is important for video streaming at HD and Ultra HD quality levels, and paramount for the gaming community,"" said Andrew Ferguson, from the news site Thinkbroadband. ""Full-fibre services are going to beat 5G as you have a connection as stable as the one that will be feeding the mobile masts and thus the variables of signal strength dropping due to a bus passing the home are avoided."" The government is currently pursuing a target of ""full-fibre"" broadband coverage to the whole UK by 2033, in which high-speed optical cables are used to bring data right up to buildings without having to rely on slower copper for part of the journey. At present, only 5% of all properties have access to the full-fibre connections, according to the regulator Ofcom. But Three's chief executive suggested the cost involved could help make 5G a more attractive option. ""Fibre-to-the-home for the small number of customers who value it and need it will probably provide a faster speed,"" Mr Dyson said. ""But I think for the majority of people, 5G will be a genuine alternative. ""It's still quite unclear to me, as I'm sure it is to many people, what is going to be the price of all these fibre-to-the-home deployments when it actually arrives ""It's expensive to dig up roads. It takes a lot of time and money. ""It's much cheaper and quicker to provide that connectivity via a wireless connection.""","5G mobile data will be so reliable and fast most homes will no longer need a separate home broadband connection, according to one of the companies planning to launch a UK service."
"Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent@BBCRoryCJon Twitter We each tweeted a video asking anyone who saw a political advert in their Facebook feed to send it to us, along with the ""Why am I seeing this ad?"" information that pops up when you click on a menu. We were not sure anyone would respond - but quickly the emails began to flood in. So far, we have received more than 600 messages with screenshots of election adverts and the information about how they have been targeted. Here's what we have learned so far. Who is advertising? Labour, the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats all got off the mark quickly, with our respondents sending us a variety of ads. And as the week went on, ads from the Brexit Party and the SNP started coming in. But what was striking was the number of non-party organisations getting involved. The most notable example was the Fair Tax Campaign, whose ad attacking Labour's tax plans was sent in by three people. It appeared without the ""Paid for by"" information Facebook requires - and when we contacted the social media giant, the advert was taken down. A few days later, it was back with the message: ""Paid for by Alexander Karcejwski Crowley,"" confirmation a former aide to Boris Johnson who left Downing Street in late September was behind the campaign. Other organisations posting ads included Parent's Choice, a campaign attacking Labour's education plans, funded by former Conservative minister Richard Tracey. Ads were also run by Best for Brexit and Best for Britain - two campaigns on opposite sides of the Brexit debate. And on Sunday, we got our first email with an ad from the Hope Not Hate campaign - not endorsing any party but attacking Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage and Tory leader Boris Johnson. What are the adverts saying? The Conservatives started with very targeted adverts aimed at key marginal constituencies, including Bridgend, with the message only a few thousand votes were needed ""to get Brexit done"". But later they broadened out with an attack on Jeremy Corbyn. Within hours of former Labour minister Ian Austin's call for voters to abandon the party, the Labour leader was featured in an ad. Labour's ads have focused on the NHS and the claim Mr Johnson poses a threat to it. One message featured a Guardian article about suggestions the UK could pay more for drugs following any trade deal with US President Donald Trump. Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats have been hammering away with a message they will stop Brexit and ""the two old parties have failed Britain"". How are the adverts targeted? While some of the early Tory ads were closely geographically targeted, later on they all seemed broad-brush. The ""Why am I seeing this ad?"" message often read: ""Conservatives want to reach people like their customers,"" over 18 and in England. But in a couple of cases, the target was more specific - males aged 23 to 30, people aged 55 or over, or women with degrees aged 30 to 50. Labour's approach to targeting is more opaque. Many of its ads told readers Facebook had ""matched your information with information on"" a list Labour wanted to reach, derived from a ""hashed list"" uploaded by Experian Marketing Services. Experian told us it used publicly available data from sources such as the electoral roll - matched with Facebook users, but then anonymised - ""to target relevant communications to particular sections of the population"". This does not include credit scores, it added. Facebook, meanwhile, said it ""does not learn any new identifying information about a person when a business uploads a list"". The Liberal Democrats are somewhat more obvious in their targeting. Their ad about the ""old parties"" is often aimed at people aged 18 to 35. And their media habits often seem to be a focus - one advert targeted at Michael Gove's Surrey Heath constituency was trying to reach ""people who Facebook thinks are interested in The Guardian and Mock the Week"". The Brexit Party has tended to target people in specific locations, from Frome in Somerset to Skipton in Yorkshire. But one ""Why am I seeing this?"" message gives useful insights into the workings of Facebook's ""lookalike audience"" feature, used by many of the parties. ""The Brexit Party identified a group of existing customers that it wanted to use to find similar customers,"" the message said. ""Facebook used this group of existing customers to find potential customers for the advertiser."" Does this targeting work? Much has been made of the way Facebook allows political campaigns to micro-target their ads, crafting hundreds of different messages suited to the personalities of each individual. So far, however, our project seems to suggest this whole idea may have been oversold. We have seen no evidence voters are seeing lots of different messages, indeed the same adverts keep cropping up all over the country. And we are hearing plenty of scepticism about targeting, with respondents convinced the parties are missing the mark both geographically and when it comes to their political preferences. ""They got my age right is all you can say,"" wrote one person about a Conservative ad aimed at anyone over 18. ""I live in Wales and never voted Tory and never will."" Someone in the Chorley constituency of the new speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle wondered why the Labour Party was targeting him with an ad when it would not need to contest that seat. Plenty of people reported ads that made incorrect assumptions about their location - suggesting Facebook can often be a blunt instrument. Most bizarrely, one ad urging a vote for the Conservatives in the Wirral West constituency to ""get Brexit done"" was received in Clitheroe - and actually appeared to have been targeted at the Lancashire town. ""Nowhere near. We're about 89 miles roughly north of the Wirral peninsula,"" wrote the Clitheroe-based recipient, helpfully attaching a Google Maps screenshot. And a few people were angered by the fact they had been tracked at all. ""None of my profile information is supposed to be shared beyond me or my friends but my information seems to have been uploaded and shared with five different marketing companies,"" wrote one person who sent us three ads. ""I tightened up my ad settings a few days ago and I've had no political ads since."" About half a million pounds has been spent on Facebook ads in the first week of the campaign and all the signs are we could see record spending by polling day. ""Half the money I spend on advertising is wasted - the trouble is I don't know which half,"" an American retailing tycoon is supposed to have said more than 100 years ago. Some things don't change. Across the political spectrum, the parties' digital experts will be trying in the coming weeks to work out how to cut down on waste when it comes to their Facebook campaigns. Please get involved - if you get an election ad on Facebook or any social-media platform, send a screenshot of it and the ""Why am I seeing this ad?"" message to election.ads@bbc.co.uk.","Last weekend, BBC News economics editor Faisal Islam and I launched a project to try to get beneath the digital skin of this election."
"The TurkGuvenligi hacking group claims to have defaced the site replacing its front page with a mocking message. The main website of the Syrian Electronic Army (SEA) is still offline hours after the attack took place. The defacement is embarrassing for the SEA which has regularly caught out media organisations by hacking their websites and social media feeds. Security analyst Graham Cluley noticed the attack had taken place and in a blogpost said the Turkish hackers appeared to have got access to the website by targeting the company that hosted the website. ""The SEA has discovered what it feels like to be a victim,"" wrote Mr Cluley. TurkGuvenligi and the SEA clashed on Twitter and exchanged insults as news about the defacement spread. The SEA claimed TurkGuvenligi carried out the website hack simply to get attention rather than in retaliation for an attack by the Syrian group on Turkish sites. The attack turns the tables on the SEA which before now has compromised many different sites and organisations to post messages in support of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. It is believed to have caught out the Washington Post, the BBC, AP, Skype, the New York Times, the Guardian, the Financial Times and Reuters.",The website of the Syrian Electronic Army has been attacked and defaced by a rival group of Turkish hackers.
"The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported on Friday that cyber-thieves had accessed US citizens' email addresses, tax ID numbers and more driver licence information than acknowledged earlier. US Senator Elizabeth Warren is now demanding details of any other data the firm believes may have been stolen. She wants a reply by the week's end. ""As your company continues to issue incomplete, confusing, and contradictory statements and hide information from Congress and the public, it is clear that five months after the breach was publicly announced, Equifax has yet to answer this simple question in full: what was the precise extent of the breach?"" the Democratic senator from Massachusetts wrote in a letter to the credit rating agency. The WSJ said it was unclear how many of the 145.5 million Americans that the firm had previously said were affected by the breach, had had the additional information about them exposed. The Atlanta, Georgia-based company, one of the biggest companies of its kind, had previously confirmed that social security numbers, birth dates and addresses had been compromised. ""We have complied with applicable notification requirements in the disclosure process,"" the firm told the WSJ. It added that it believed that the additional driver licence data exposed - which is reported to have involved issue dates and the states that granted them - was ""extremely minimal"". UK update The data breach - which is thought to have occurred between mid-May and July 2017 - also affected customers in the UK. Last month, Equifax revealed that it was writing to a further 167,431 consumers in the country on top of the 693,665 it had already promised to notify. A spokeswoman for Equifax said the latest disclosure from the US should not imply that additional information about UK citizens had also been stolen. ""This information does not change the number of consumers affected or any of the UK figures/statements already provided,"" she said. The UK's Financial Conduct Authority is currently investigating Equifax over the cyber-attack, but said it had nothing to add to a letter outlining the probe that it issued in October.","Equifax is facing a fresh demand to disclose the full extent of last year's data breach, following a report that it was bigger than previously disclosed."
"Dave LeeNorth America technology reporter So, barring any surprises – a Steve Jobs-esque “one more thing” – we have a pretty good idea of what to expect when Tim Cook heads out on stage on Wednesday. He’ll do it as the chief executive of the first US company to reach a value of $1tn (£768bn). To keep it that way, Apple will be building on past successes rather than introducing anything dramatically new. We’ll likely see three new iPhones, a revamped Apple Watch, and maybe some new iPads. Later in the year, rumour suggests a budget laptop may be on the way. What we won’t see, however, are some of the innovative leaps being promised by some of Apple’s competitors. Samsung plans a device with a flexible display by the end of the year. OnePlus said its next phone will have a fingerprint sensor built into the screen. Huawei, which recently overtook Apple in global smartphone sales, has said it is working on a flexible device of its own. But, of course, Apple’s strength is in ignoring such emerging technologies until they feel the time is right to build it into their products. As far as they see it, there’s no point in technology for technology’s sake – a philosophy that has been validated year after year. ""Right now the iPhone franchise is so strong that it feels like it's almost untouchable,"" says Ben Wood, an analyst at CCS Insight. ""Even at a time when rivals such as Samsung are having to push the envelope on developing new technology such as folding screens."" Last year, it was the iPhone’s 10-year anniversary, and fans were expecting a reinvention of the device. What they got was the iPhone X – Ten – that, while not revolutionising the range, did at least push it into something of a new design phase. It also brought the iPhone into a new price bracket: $999. Anticipation is not nearly as high this time around. This is what is referred to as an “S” year, when Apple doesn’t make any major changes to its device, save for some internal improvements – and tacks an “S” to the device name to make it clear. So, in keeping with that theme, we’re expecting an iPhone XS. As well as that, leaks suggest another, larger version – one which may make $999 the “cheaper” option of the two. That bigger version might be called the XS Max, a name which to me sounds more like a muscle-building powder supplement, but hey - I’m not a marketer. Apple’s stock price went up dramatically when the company revealed the average selling price of an iPhone was going up. Some had been concerned - Apple was very much testing the water with its iPhone X’s $999 price point last year, its most expensive phone ever. Twelve months on, the answer to “will people spend that much on an iPhone?” is, according to sales figures, an emphatic “yes”. With the XS Max we’ll see how far Apple can push it. Beyond the XS and XS Max, completing the set in 2018 may be a budget version of the iPhone X. If so, that would mean the home button, the circular button that made the iPhone instantly recognisable, will be no more. While the iPhone remains Apple’s bread and butter, accounting for the vast amount of the firm’s profits, a growing part of its business comes from other areas, such as the Apple Watch. The device hasn’t seen the blockbuster sales some might have expected since its launch in 2015 but it’s comfortably the biggest-selling smartwatch on the market. Leaks suggest we may see a new Apple Watch with a slightly bigger screen and more sophisticated heart-monitoring capabilities. Three years since the original, I predict the Apple Watch being a big seller this Christmas – early adopters are primed to upgrade, and those who held back might now be tempted. Apple Watch sales are good for Apple’s wider business – it only works with the iPhone, naturally. How were the Apple leaks found? Several rumour sites compete for tidbits of information about Apple's forthcoming products and often manage to share details before the tech giant would like them to be disclosed. But at the end of last month, 9to5Mac's publication of what appeared to be official marketing images of one of the new iPhones and a new Apple Watch was a real coup for the site. ""To my memory, this is unprecedented,"" wrote the veteran Apple commentator John Gruber. After much speculation about how he achieved his scoop, 9to5Mac's Guilherme Rambo has now revealed the technique he used via his Twitter account. He wrote that he had studied the web addresses that Apple had used to host images of products announced at its last ""special event"" and deduced what the equivalents might be this time round. He said he had not expected to find anything when he typed in the addresses, but was successful on his first attempt. ""Looking at the naming for past events, sometimes they combine multiple things into one recap image, which makes them harder to guess,"" he explained. ""We managed to guess the iPhone and Watch ones because they are 'hero' shots."" ""Apple took them down immediately after we published,"" he added. The iPhone-maker is likely to keep its secrets more closely guarded next time round. _____ Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC Do you have more information about this or any other technology story?

"“There will be no extension of the TikTok deadline,” Mr Trump said. The president has given the Chinese owner of the app, ByteDance, 45 days to sell it. TikTok declined to comment on Mr Trump's statement. If ByteDance doesn’t sell the app, then US firms will be barred from doing business with it after the deadline has elapsed. “We’ll see what happens. It’ll either be closed up or they’ll sell it,” said Mr Trump on Thursday, when explaining that the deadline would not be pushed back. According to Mr Trump, TikTok and other Chinese apps that collect data on US citizens pose a national security threat. TikTok had previously said it was ""shocked"" by the prospect of a ban. It has launched a legal challenge. ByteDance also faces restrictions on selling its assets to firms outside China, which further complicates the sale of TikTok. Among the firms known to have expressed interest in buying TikTok are Microsoft and US retail giant Walmart.","The Chinese owner of TikTok has until 15 September – and not a day longer – to find an American buyer for the video-sharing app, or face being banned in the US, according to President Donald Trump."
"Several countries have raised security concerns about its products, and Germany has considered blocking it from its next generation mobile network. The company is also accused of stealing trade secrets in the US, and its chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou is under house arrest in Canada. Ms Meng appeared in court for the first time in March. She has counter-sued the Canadian government over her arrest and detention. What are countries worried about? There are fears that China is using Huawei as a proxy so it can spy on rival nations and scoop up useful information. Huawei has said it is independent and gives nothing to the country's government, apart from relevant taxes. Critics question how free any major Chinese business can be from Beijing's influence. They point out that its media-shy founder Ren Zhengfei was a former engineer in the country's army and joined the Communist Party in 1978. In an interview with the BBC, Mr Ren said the US' actions would not ""crush"" the company. ""If the lights go out in the West, the East will still shine,"" he said. Huawei is keen to portray itself as a private company owned by its employees with no ties to the Chinese government beyond those of a law-abiding taxpayer. Mr Ren said he would rather ""shut down"" Huawei than spy for the Chinese authorities. Timeline of highs and lows October 2012: A US congressional panel warns that Huawei and rival ZTE pose a security threat, following an investigation July 2013: The company denies claims made by a former US Central ­Intelligence Agency (CIA) chief that it spied for the Chinese government October 2014: The company says a ban on bidding for US government contracts is ""not very important"" 19 July 2018: A UK government report says it has ""only limited assurance"" that Huawei's broadband and mobile infrastructure equipment poses no threat to national security 30 July: Huawei overtakes Apple to become the world's second-biggest smartphone-maker, according to market analysts 23 August: Australia says Huawei and rival firm ZTE will be excluded from its next generation 5G network, citing security fears 28 November: New Zealand excludes Huawei from its 5G network 1 December: Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou is arrested in Vancouver, Canada 7 December: At a court hearing, it is revealed that Ms Wanzhou is wanted in the US on fraud charges relating to the alleged breaking of US sanctions on Iran 24 December: BT confirms that Huawei equipment is being removed from the heart of a communication system being developed for the UK's emergency services 4 January 2019: Two Huawei employees are punished after posting a new year message on the company's Twitter account using an iPhone 12 January: Huawei sacks an employee who was arrested in Poland on suspicion of spying.

Also, China accuses two Canadians detained in retaliation over Ms Meng's arrest of stealing trade secrets 7 March: Huawei sues US government over the ban on federal agencies using its products How independent is Huawei? Huawei can lay claim to being one of the biggest spenders on research and development. It invested more than $13.2bn (£10.2bn) in 2017 and has said the figure will be even higher for 2018. It has said that building futuristic 5G networks without its technology and innovations would be like the Premier League without Manchester United. But critics fear that the Chinese government could order the firm to modify its devices to help hack attacks, eavesdrop on conversations or gain high-level access to sensitive networks. There are questions about whether China would allow a technology firm that has been deeply embedded in rival nations' infrastructure to remain independent. Huawei is now the second biggest smartphone-maker in the world. Which countries have taken action? The UK has not enacted a ban on the use of Huawei equipment. However, the firm's products are regularly subjected to security testing by the UK's GCHQ intelligence agency. The co-operative agreement between the UK and Huawei includes a facility nicknamed the Cell in Banbury, Oxfordshire. There, staff employed by Huawei but answering to GCHQ, look for security flaws in the company's products. The last report GCHQ produced said it found ""shortcomings"" in products that meant it could only give ""limited assurance"" that the firm posed no threat. Huawei has previously agreed to a series of technical demands by GCHQ that would harden its products against attackers. In its latest guidance, the UK's National Cyber Security Centre said the dangers posed by Huawei tech were ""manageable"". Why was a Huawei executive arrested? Ms Meng was arrested while transferring between flights in Vancouver, although her detention was not revealed by Canadian authorities until four days later, the day of her first court appearance. Details of the charges were also not revealed at the time, after she was granted a publication ban by a Canadian judge. But at a bail hearing at the Supreme Court of British Columbia, a Canadian government lawyer said Ms Meng had used a Huawei subsidiary called Skycom to evade sanctions on Iran between 2009 and 2014. The court was told she had publicly misrepresented Skycom as being a separate company. China has demanded Ms Meng's release, insisting she has not violated any laws. In a statement, Huawei said it was not aware of any wrongdoing by Ms Meng, adding: ""The company believes the Canadian and US legal systems will ultimately reach a just conclusion. ""Huawei complies with all applicable laws and regulations where it operates, including applicable export control and sanction laws and regulations of the UN, US and EU.""",Chinese telecoms giant Huawei has been the focus of intense international scrutiny lately.
"His re-election campaign team is investigating the security breach. ""The world has had enough of the fake news spreaded [sic] daily"" by the US president, a message on www.donaldjtrump.com briefly displayed. The campaign team said there was ""no exposure to sensitive data because none of it is actually stored on the site"". The website has now been restored. Screenshots circulating online show the website briefly displayed a fake message, accompanied by the FBI and the US Department of Justice badges. ""It is time to allow the world to know the truth,"" the text on the website read. ""Multiple devices were compromised that gave full access to Trump and relatives."" The hackers also claimed to have proof that the US administration ""is involved in the origin of the coronavirus"" and interfering in the presidential election, which takes place on 3 November. The message then asked for cryptocurrency donations in exchange for access to this information. There is no evidence to back these statements, and the Trump campaign denies any sensitive data was collected. ""The Trump campaign website was defaced and we are working with law enforcement authorities to investigate the source of the attack. There was no exposure to sensitive data because none of it is actually stored on the site,"" Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh said in a statement to CNN. Website defacements are a low level form of cyber-vandalism akin to someone trespassing on private land and writing a nasty message on a wall in spray paint. The attack only lasted 30 minutes before the hackers were kicked out, so it's unlikely they would have gained much other than a target on their backs if they were silly enough to leave a trail. What's more serious is the potential cyber-security failing on the part of the Trump campaign. This embarrassing incident comes just a week after a Dutch ethical hacker claimed to have logged into the US president's Twitter account by guessing his password. This has yet to be verified. There is no such thing as 100% secure when it comes to cyber-security, but in both these incidents it seems like basic steps might not have been taken. Mr Trump has also been very critical of other people for failing cyber-security measures in the past. During the 2016 election campaign, he criticised opponent Hillary Clinton when her emails were exposed in a hack.

"Market researcher Childwise asked more than 1,000 UK parents about their pre-schooler offspring's media habits. It said three-quarters of the children had access to a connected device and most of the three- and four-year-olds had their own tablet or PC. The BBC's Cbeebies was the children's favourite channel and YouTube the most popular app. But their tastes were becoming more diverse, Childwise added. ""The increasing use of connected devices by preschoolers this year may reflect growing access to on-demand services, especially subscription-based options such as Netflix, which has quickly risen through the ranks over the last three to four years,"" said research manager Jenny Ehren. ""Their list of favourite programmes is becoming more varied. And whilst many are drawn from across the different preschool channels, we are beginning to see more references to content exclusively available on YouTube and paid-for streaming services."" Overall, the study indicated that children were typically spending an average of two hours and 48 minutes a day - up from two hours and 36 minutes last year and two hours and 24 minutes in 2014 - watching video content in all its forms. But boys were said to watch for longer periods of time. Voice-recognition gadgets such as Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa were also said to be increasingly popular with the age group, with nursery rhymes and asking questions - such as: ""How big is the moon?"" - among common activities. But the children remain interested in offline activities too. And there was an increase in the number of parents reporting their children were engaged in arts and crafts and going to the library outside of school. Last year, Ofcom research found that 21% of 3-4 year olds owned their own tablet.","Three out of four children under-five now has access to a tablet, smartphone or computer, according to a study."
"The FBI said Richard Castro, of Florida, had bought the equivalent of ""approximately 100 quadrillion [1,000 trillion] Zimbabwe bank notes"" in June 2018. Use of the currency had ended years earlier, following hyperinflation. The purchase is thought to have been part of a wider money laundering scheme Castro also bought hundreds of thousands of US dollars worth of vehicles and ""luxury automobile [wheel] rims"". The accused initially made his fortune by illegally dealing opioids, including fentanyl and carfentanil - both of which are stronger than heroin. These were initially sold via AlphaBay and Dream Market, markets on the Tor network accessed via a special web browser only. However, after the authorities shut AlphaBay down and were rumoured to have compromised Dream Market's platform, Castro told his clients he would accept purchases via encrypted email only and required them to pay the equivalent of a $104 (£85) fee in Bitcoin to be told the address. An undercover police officer paid the fee and used the address to order several deliveries, which first helped identify one of Castro's associates and then the dealer himself, who had gone by the nickname Chems_usa. Castro initially claimed to be not guilty before changing his plea last week. He has since agreed to surrender a sum worth the equivalent of about $4.16m, earned through the criminal venture. He is due to be sentenced on 25 October and could face decades in jail.",A drug dealer who used dark web marketplaces to ply his trade apparently used part of the proceeds to buy vast quantities of Zimbabwean cash.
"Dave LeeNorth America technology reporter In an interview with BBC News, Microsoft's chief executive Satya Nadella has said that despite national security concerns, backing out of China would “hurt more” than it solved. “A lot of AI research happens in the open, and the world benefits from knowledge being open,” he said. ""That to me is been what's been true since the Renaissance and the scientific revolution. Therefore, I think, for us to say that we will put barriers on it may in fact hurt more than improve the situation everywhere.” Microsoft’s first office in China was opened by founder and then-chief executive Bill Gates in 1992. Its main location in Beijing now employs more than 200 scientists and involves over 300 visiting scholars and students. It is currently recruiting for, among other roles, researchers in machine learning. In April, it was reported by the Financial Times that Microsoft researchers were collaborating with teams at China’s National University of Defence Technology, working on artificial intelligence projects that some outside observers warned could be used for oppressive means. Speaking to the newspaper, Republican Senator Ted Cruz said: “American companies need to understand that doing business in China carries significant and deepening risk.” He added: ""In addition to being targeted by the Chinese Communist party for espionage, American companies are increasingly at risk of boosting the Chinese Communist party’s human rights atrocities."" Technology as weapon Mr Nadella acknowledged that risk. “We know any technology can be a tool or a weapon,” he told the BBC. “The question is, how do you ensure that these weapons don't get created? I think there are multiple mechanisms. The first thing is we, as creators, should start with having a set of ethical design principles to ensure that we're creating AI that's fair, that's secure, that's private, that's not biased.” He said he felt his company had sufficient control over how the controversial emerging technologies are used, and said the firm had turned down requests in China - and elsewhere - to engage in projects it felt were inappropriate, due to either technical infeasibility or ethical concerns. “We do have control on who gets to use our technology. And we do have principles. Beyond how we build it, how people use it is something that we control through Terms of Use. And we are constantly evolving the terms of use. ""We also recognise whether it's in the United States, whether it's in China, whether it's in the United Kingdom, they will all have their own legislative processes on what they accept or don't accept, and we will abide by them.” 'Leaves me wondering...' Matt Sheehan, from the Paulson Institute, studies the relationship between California's technology scene and the Chinese economy. He said Microsoft's efforts, particularly its Beijing office, have had tremendous impact. ""It dramatically advanced the field, advances that have helped the best American and European AI research labs push further,"" he said. ""But those same advances feed into the field of computer vision, a key enabler of China's surveillance apparatus."" He cites one particular paper as highlighting the complexity of working with, and within, China. Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition, published in 2016, was a research paper produced by four Chinese researchers working at Microsoft. According to Google Scholar, which indexes research papers, their paper was cited more than 25,256 times between 2014-2018 - more than any other paper in any other field of research. ""The lead author now works for a US tech company in California,"" said Mr Sheehan, referring to Facebook. ""Two other authors work for a company involved in Chinese surveillance. And the last author is trying to build autonomous vehicles in China. ""What do we make of all that?

"The prime minister had been the ""last member of the No 10 team"" still using a Blackberry handset, news site Politico reported. The Canadian company behind Blackberry stopped making smartphones itself in 2016, following a steep decline in sales, and licensed other companies to make devices in its name. For security reasons, Mrs May's new iPhone is unlikely to have many apps. New world The decision is a further signal of how the reputation of the Blackberry handset, once considered one of the world's most secure mobile devices, has changed. ""Blackberry, once the champion of the workplace, has very much become a niche player with strong competitors on all sides,"" said Stuart Miles, founder of gadget review site Pocket-lint. ""It isn't completely washed up yet - but it's had its powerful moment in the sun. I'm not sure it will ever rise to be the trailblazer it once was."" Of Mrs May's decision, he added: ""It's hard to change, but sometimes you have to embrace a new world."" In 2013, US President Barack Obama revealed he was not allowed to have an iPhone, for security reasons, but was able to keep his Blackberry. And in January 2017 President Donald Trump reportedly had to give up his Android phone on the advice of US security agencies.",Theresa May has replaced her Blackberry mobile device with an iPhone.
"By Gareth EvansBBC News Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger have overseen the app's rapid rise. But what made their idea so successful? And how has it continued to grow? The story, rather fittingly, begins with a picture of a dog. Kevin Systrom's photograph of a stray dog sitting near a taco stand in Mexico is the first image ever shared on Instagram. The app's co-founder captioned it 'test', and uploaded it a few months before his idea was launched to the public on October 6 2010. ""Had I known it was going to be the first photo on Instagram I would have tried a bit harder,"" Mr Systrom later told The Daily Telegraph. The candid picture - which has been liked more than 93,000 times - was the culmination of an idea he formed with Mike Krieger, who he met while studying at Stanford University. The pair were inspired by their shared love of technology and photography, and after abandoning a prototype app, they launched Instagram as a simple way to share good-looking, edited, photographs. It was an immediate success, gaining one million users in its first couple of months. Some experts say it arrived at the perfect moment. ""Instagram came at a time when we had two things that weren't well put together,"" says Dr Bernie Hogan, who has been researching social media for more than 15 years. ""There were photo-editing apps and social sharing apps. At that time Facebook mobile wasn't very good at all and Twitter didn't have a way to share photos meaningfully,"" he says. ""Instagram came right up in the middle between having photos and enabling sharing."" It also launched at a time when mobile photography was becoming increasingly popular, and it may even have benefited from the relatively low quality of early phone cameras. ""Plenty of people were using smartphones - but the built-in cameras were rubbish,"" says Jemima Gibbons, a social media consultant in London. ""Instagram was a great way to make those bad photos look good - and to add your own personal twist on top."" ""They launched at the right time,"" she says. ""Broadband was more ubiquitous, people were getting faster download speeds, and mobile devices were getting smarter. They hit the wave spot on."" The company has ridden that wave ever since. Within two years more than 50m users had joined the app and in 2012 it was bought by Facebook for $1bn (£760m). Its unrelenting growth has continued year on year and, in June, Mr Systrom revealed that the app had reached one billion users. It has continued to evolve, introducing a number of features which have attracted new users and changed the way people use it. Its most high-profile change was introducing Stories, which allows people to post and watch temporary videos. It also introduced a range of augmented reality effects. Both of these were features that its rival Snapchat introduced first - and experts say their introduction was a shrewd move. ""Instagram's done well by cleverly taking the best features from rivals while avoiding the bad,"" Ms Gibbons says. ""But the core product feels like it's been relatively unchanged, which is great for users."" The introduction of Stories was a game-changer that led to people posting more frequent updates, says social media expert Jodie Cook, ""[It] changed the platform from being someone's incredibly polished portfolio to being the real, behind the scenes, nitty gritty side of their world,"" she says. ""It has certainly made Instagram part of someone's everyday life,"" she adds. ""It essentially turns each account into a vlog, whereas before it was more like a portfolio."" ""For users, especially celebrities or those with a large profile, they were able to share more personal and less polished content because it would only be there for 24 hours."" An important part of Instagram's success has been its ability to attract these celebrities who in turn attract a large number of followers. Its most-followed accounts include Selena Gomez (143m followers), footballer Cristiano Ronaldo (142m) and singer Ariana Grande (129m). ""Once celebrities started joining people felt like they knew them on a different level because it wasn't what the magazines and the newspapers were publishing,"" says Sam Burgess, who advises businesses on social media use. ""But this was capitalised on by companies who saw they had a captive audience,"" she says. This meant Instagram quickly became an important platform for advertising. ""Businesses need ambassadors and they found Instagram influencers [accounts with large followings that promote products] were more relatable to the public,"" she says. ""This has created a very different way of marketing and advertising."" ""It's been crazy for some businesses and I know that some have had amazing results and sold-out whole ranges from doing this."" Ms Burgess says that the rise of influencers has helped drive the growth of Instagram as a whole. ""Everybody wants to be an influencer,"" she says. ""People have seen how easy it is to start an account and they believe it can be an easy way to make money."" ""On the other side, small businesses have been signing up because they know there is the power to connect with influencers and invite them to promote their products or services."" ""This is definitely something that has spiralled the growth of Instagram."" Facebook will be hoping that growth continues, even without the two men who have led Instagram this far.","Instagram has attracted a billion users since it was launched in 2010. Now, its founders have announced they are quitting the company."
"Companies that publish, share or edit news will need a government licence, and senior editors must be approved by the authorities. Other staff will be required to undergo government training and assessment, and receive official accreditation. The legislation will bring online news providers into line with traditional news media operating in the country. From 1 June, when the rules come into force, they will be expected to follow ""information security protocols"", including ""emergency response"" measures such as increased vetting following disasters, according to the state news agency Xinhua. In a statement published online, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) said the new rules would ""strengthen management of information"" and ""promote the healthy and orderly development of internet news, in accordance to law"". Public interest The list of providers and platforms covered includes ""websites, applications, forums, blogs, microblogs, public accounts, instant messaging tools and internet broadcasts"". Organisations that do not have a licence will not be allowed to post news or commentary about the government, economy, military, foreign affairs, or ""other areas of public interest"". Editorial and business operations must be kept separate. Only publicly funded organisations will be able to carry out their own reporting. Analysis: Kerry Allen, BBC Monitoring This most recent regulation from the Chinese state will make it more difficult for business media in the mainland to stay competitive. Many outlets are independent and operate online. It has already been problematic for staff from such organisations to obtain press cards to events - but financial websites such as Caijing and Caixin Online have traditionally been able to secure strong followings online because of their credible investigative journalism, and their articles are often shared through popular news portals. But in recent months, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) has made increased efforts to tighten online media regulation - particularly as live streaming and video blogging becomes a popular means of telling news. In July 2016, it fined and disciplined a number of news portals for sharing independent news stories. The following month, the CAC introduced rules for users of live streaming platforms to be monitored full-time, and in December of the same year, the CAC announced that all live streaming users needed a permit. Chinese outlets will not be allowed to enter joint ventures with foreign partners, or accept foreign funding, until they have a passed a security assessment carried out by the government's State Council Information Office. Companies that fail to comply will have their licences withdrawn and face fines of up to 30,000 yuan ($4,350: £3,370). Google, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and many foreign news websites are banned in China.",The Chinese government has issued new regulations tightening its control over online news content.
"Social security numbers, birth dates, telephone numbers and, in some cases, driver's licence and credit card numbers were exposed, leaving people vulnerable to identity theft and fraud. Companies know more about individuals than they ever have. And almost every week there is news of a data hack. So does this mean that the age of personal privacy is over? BBC World Service's The Inquiry programme has been hearing the views of four experts. 'Database of ruin' ""Technology has created enormous conveniences for us, but there is no reason why those conveniences have to inevitably come at the cost of giving up our privacy wholesale,"" says Ben Wizner, of the American Civil Liberties Union, who is chief legal adviser to the US intelligence leaker Edward Snowdon. Mr Wizner says people should be able to control information held on them, as well as with whom they share it. ""It is now both technologically and financially feasible for corporations and governments to collect and store records of almost all of our activities, records that never would have existed in the past,"" he says. All of this - whether harvested from the web, mobile phones or social media - creates vast amounts of data from consumers, held by corporations. And with the advent of smart appliances, this will only increase. ""You will be watching your television, your television will be watching you."" And he has concerns about agreements meant to safeguard consumers' data. ""It is literally impossible for consumers to read all of those agreements. What we all do instead is we click ""agree"". In legal terms, we have consented. In meaningful terms, have we consented?"" Personal information, Mr Wizner says, allows corporations to make highly accurate predictions about a person's life, including their sexuality and any health problems they may have. ""I think that we hear all too often this sort of blase remark that 'I don't need to be worried about surveillance because I've done nothing wrong and I have nothing to hide.' ""For every single one of us, there is some pile of aggregated data that exists, the publication of which would cause us enormous harm and, in some cases, even professional and personal ruin. ""Every single one of us has a database of ruin."" The post-privacy economy Former Amazon chief scientist Andreas Weigend says the time has come to recognise that privacy is now an illusion. He grew up in West Germany, where his family moved following his father's release from prison in East Germany, where he had been a political prisoner. Later, he discovered that, though his father's Stasi files had been destroyed, the secret police had opened a file on him, in 1986, when he was a graduate student in the US. Though he felt vulnerable after this revelation, his views on privacy are clear. ""I have realised that even if you were a privacy zealot, you don't have a chance. ""Data is being created as we breathe, as we live, and it is too hard a battle to try to live without creating data. ""And that is a starting point: that you assume that we do live in a post-privacy economy."" Indeed, he has just written a book called Data For the People: How to Make Our Post-Privacy Economy Work for You. Or daily lives, he says, constantly lead to the creation of new data: from phones, credit cards, public transport systems and more. ""I think we don't have the time in the day to know everything that's being created about us. ""On the other hand, we don't want companies to just scoop up all the data that we create and never tell us anything about it."" He believes we should embrace the fact we're creating lots of data, because we get better products and services in return. ""Every battle we should fight now is, 'And what can we, as individuals, as citizens, get out of the data which we create?' ""Having new technologies means that we need to think about what actually does 'privacy' mean. So, it's time to actually redefine privacy."" But Mr Weigend isn't willing to let go of all privacy. There is ""no way"", for instance, he would publish his browsing history. ""I think our browsing histories are way more personal than what we share with our partners. ""Our most secret questions in our mind, our most secret desires, they end up at Google and where Google takes us."" His message to people concerned about privacy is simple. ""Think about your computer security, think about your passwords, think about just how lax, probably, your own personal security is."" And he believes that people's views on privacy will change, just as things have already changed. ""What the KGB wouldn't have gotten out of people under torture, now people knowingly and willingly publish on Facebook."" Naked on the net Svea Eckert is an investigative reporter for Germany's national broadcaster, ARD. Last year she decided to adopt a fake name and set up a fake company, complete with its own website. Her target? Detailed information showing which web pages individuals had visited, offered for sale by companies who gather data about people's internet use. She and a colleague eventually gained access to a month's worth of de-anonymised browsing records of about 20 people, all in high-profile positions. The URLs pointed to details of a criminal investigation, a senior executive's complete financial records, a judge's daily porn viewing habits and the browsing histories of politicians. The subjects were shocked when shown the data held about them. It emerged that all this data had come from a browser plug-in that these users had installed. Ms Eckert says it wasn't legal for the data to be sold but there has been no action against the company selling it, because it was based outside the EU. And she is concerned at how smaller marketing companies were able to sell this sensitive data but may not have had the money available to wealthy corporations to protect themselves from hackers. ""I think at the moment we are living in a time which is like the time was when people were not wearing seatbelts in the car."" A future with less data? ""The beauty of what's been occurring in the past year or two,"" says Gus Hosein, head of Privacy International, a global non-governmental organisation campaigning for privacy, ""has been that some of the companies who are core now to the delivery of the internet as we know it have taken security and privacy much more seriously. ""What is disappointing is that below the waterline, below what we can see, some of these companies have doubled-down or tripled-down on the extent to which they are grabbing data and doing things with that data without you ever being able to see."" But he thinks there is a limit to how much individual behaviour can achieve in securing online privacy. ""Almost every positive move that Facebook and Google and the other large companies have taken, particularly the data companies… has been as a result of regulatory pressure."" Most technology companies are based in the US where, he says, lobbyists have prevented regulations from being imposed. That lobbying influence has proven less effective in Europe, where a new law, the General Data Protection Regulation, designed to increase safeguards on the storage and handling of personal data, is due to come into effect next year. ""My worry is that we'll become desensitised and we'll become quite resigned to the fact that, 'Yeah, our data is harvested, and, yeah, I guess it is not secure, and, yeah, I guess any criminal who wanted to can get access to it.' ""The defence of privacy will be the saviour of the future, essentially."" The Inquiry: Is privacy dead? was broadcast on Thursday 5 October. Listen online or download the podcast.","Last month, 145 million Americans discovered they were victims of one of the biggest data breaches in history, after the credit rating agency Equifax was hacked."
"The numbers, released under a Freedom of Information request, include smartphones, laptops, and tablets. The Ministry of Defence reported the most missing devices, with 767 lost or stolen, followed by tax authority HMRC, with 288. While the large majority of devices were encrypted, nearly 200 may not have been, the information reveals. The Ministry of Defence said its employees lost more devices because there were more of them. The numbers include military personnel in the Army, the Royal Navy, and Royal Air Force. It also said it had ""robust"" procedures in place around encryption. The report was commissioned by mobile communications firm Viasat. It contacted 47 public bodies and said 27 answered its Freedom of Information requests with data from 1 June 2018 - 1 June 2019. Of the 2,004 devices: The information requests also showed whether or not the data on the phones was encrypted - which would make it much more difficult to access. More than 90% were - but 65 phones were not, and another 115 were marked as having an ""unknown"" encryption status. A government spokesman said: ""Data security is a top priority for the UK government and is supported by £1.9bn of investment under the National Cyber-Security Programme."" Prof Alan Woodward from the University of Surrey, said that modern security policies reduced the risks, allowing IT administrators to wipe phones remotely, or even locate them via GPS. Only 249 government devices were recovered, according to the information Viasat received. Prof Woodward said problems arose when good security policies were not followed. ""There is nothing to stop users using their personal devices to store sensitive information,"" he said. That includes simple things like sensitive contact details or calendars - but potentially, other passwords, or access to two-factor authentication. ""They shouldn't, but it is then very reliant upon the strong Pin code being in place – and it's surprising just how many people either don't use a Pin or use weak Pins that can be guessed before the data is erased."" And even a strong password is not iron-clad, he warned, because ""not all phones are equally secure... some phones are easier to recover data from without the user's Pin"".","UK government employees lost their mobile devices - or had them stolen - at least 2,004 times in 12 months."
"By Chris FoxTechnology reporter The company said it was the first time it had taken down a UK-based group targeting messages at British citizens. The same group set up pages posing both as far-right outlets and anti-fascist activists. Facebook said it had shared its discovery with law enforcement and the government. The group was able to gain followers by setting up innocent-looking pages and groups. It later renamed them, and started posting politically-motivated content. MP Damian Collins, who chairs a committee investigating fake news, said it was the ""tip of the iceberg"". Hate speech Facebook said about 175,000 people followed at least one of the fake pages, which included 35 profiles on Instagram. The company said the pages ""engaged in hate speech and spread divisive comments on both sides of the political debate in the UK"". ""They frequently posted about local and political news including topics like immigration, free speech, racism, LGBT issues, far-right politics, issues between India and Pakistan, and religious beliefs including Islam and Christianity. ""We're taking down these pages and accounts based on their behaviour, not the content they posted. In each of these cases, the people behind this activity coordinated with one another and used fake accounts to misrepresent themselves, and that was the basis for our action.""

"Negobot uses artificial intelligence (AI) software to chat realistically and mimic the language used by teenagers. The ""virtual Lolita"" starts off neutral but will adopt any of seven personalities according to the intensity of interactions. Experts say it can help overburdened police but may risk trapping people unfairly. The team behind the project at the University of Deusto near Bilbao say the software represents a real advance. One of its creators, Dr Carlos Laorden, said that in the past ""chatbots"" have tended to be very predictable. ""Their behaviour and interest in a conversation are flat, which is a problem when attempting to detect untrustworthy targets like paedophiles,"" he noted. By contrast, the Negobot uses advanced decision-making strategies known as ""game theory"" to simulate convincing chats as they develop. It can take the lead in conversations, and remember specific facts about what had been discussed previously, and with whom. Child-like behaviour The so-called conversational agent also uses child-like language and slang, introducing spelling mistakes and contractions to further spoof the predator. Negobot would be used in a chatroom where suspected paedophiles are thought to be lurking. It initiates a chat as a fairly passive participant. It then adapts its behaviour according to the grooming techniques used by the suspect to try to win over its trust and friendship. For example, if the suspect does not appear to be enticed into having a conversation, the software can appear offended or get more insistent. And it will respond to more aggressive advances - like requests for personal information - by trying to find out more about the suspect. This can include details such as their social network profile and mobile number, information which can then be used by police to start an investigation. John Carr, a UK government adviser on child protection, welcomed any move to relieve the burden on real-world policing. But he warned the software risked enticing people to do things they otherwise would not. ""Undercover operations are extremely resource-intensive and delicate things to do. It's absolutely vital that you don't cross a line into entrapment which will foil any potential prosecution"", he said. To date, the software has been field tested on Google's chat service and could be translated into other languages. It has already attracted the attention of the Basque police force. But researchers admit that it does have limitations and will need to be monitored. Although it is has broad conversational abilities, it is not yet sophisticated enough to detect certain human traits like irony.",Spanish researchers have created a robot posing as a 14-year-old girl to spot paedophiles in online chatrooms.
"The news comes as it was confirmed the only 4G network on which the new iPhone 5 will work is that of rival EE. EE is the new 4G brand from Everything Everywhere, the parent group of mobile operators Orange and T-Mobile. O2 and Vodafone are unhappy EE, which will launch its 4G network imminently, has had a head start. The 4G technology will improve network access speed. O2's 4G network will launch with a range of LTE-enabled handsets, from Samsung, Nokia and others. An O2 spokeswoman told the BBC it wanted its 4G network up and running ""as quickly as possible"". ""We are pushing hard on behalf of our customers,"" she added. ""We are hopeful we can come to some agreement to bring the current time line forward."" Legal action? The iPhone 5 is the first of Apple's handsets to support 4G, but it has been optimised for just three spectrum bands - the 1800MHz band, which EE has been allowed to use for 4G services, the 850MHz, which doesn't work in the UK, and the 2.1GHz band, which currently only supports 3G services. Apple has taken the view the 800MHz and 2.6GHz bands, for which O2 and Vodafone and other operators will be able to bid at auction in spring 2013, are not ""developed enough"", according to Matthew Howett, an analyst with research firm Ovum. This could prove a problem for operators around Europe and would be an important differentiator for EE, he said. O2 and Vodafone could petition Ofcom to allow them to reuse the 3G band for 4G services. But Mr Howett said: ""The 3G band is heavily occupied. Ofcom has said it could take five to 10 years to free up the 3G spectrum for 4G."" An alternative would be to launch legal action to prevent EE from rolling out its 4G network. No upgrade But if O2 and Vodafone wanted to persuade Ofcom to speed up the timetable for the auction, launching legal action was unlikely to help their case, said Mr Howett. 3 is the only other UK operator who has the opportunity to launch 4G services that will work with the new iPhone. It recently bought some of Everything Everywhere's 1800MHz spectrum although it is not allowed to launch services until September 2013. ""It may ask Ofcom to allow it to launch earlier,"" said Mr Howett. A poll conducted by discount website MyVoucherCode found only a quarter of mobile phone users planned to upgrade to 4G ""in the near future"". Most, 52%, said they would not switch until 4G was available on their current network, while 58% of those not interested in buying a 4G handset said it was because they did not think 4G service would be available in their location. EE has promised 98% outdoor coverage for 4G by 2014. Vodafone told the BBC that by 2015 it aimed to offer 98% indoor coverage.","O2 has told BBC News it is ""in discussions"" to speed up the roll out of its 4G services."
"""The shutdown is aimed at preventing a repeat of leaks that occurred last year,"" Mohammed Seid at the Office for Government Communications Affairs, told the Reuters news agency. In 2016, the country banned access to social media sites after university entrance exams were posted online. But some have queried this explanation. ""We are being proactive,"" Mr Seid added, referring to exams that are due to finish on 8 June. ""We want our students to concentrate and be free of the psychological pressure and distractions that this brings."" Mr Seid is reported to have said that only social media sites had been blocked, but sources in Ethiopia told the BBC that there was widespread internet disruption, affecting both mobile networks and fixed line internet services. A state of emergency has been in effect in Ethiopia since October, following anti-government protests. Mobile internet access has been disabled on other occasions recently, including a period of a few weeks last year. On Thursday, the BBC was unable to access websites belonging to the Ethiopian government and the sole communications provider, Ethio Telecom. Preliminary data from Google suggested that there had indeed been a big drop in Ethiopian internet traffic to Google services since Wednesday afternoon.","Internet access across Ethiopia has been blocked to prevent national exam papers leaking online, a government spokesman has claimed."
"""Stream+ is a loyalty points system where players can earn points by watching streams,"" said Patrick Gilmore of Amazon Game Studios. He said points could be used in ""polls and wagering"" and could be spent on items to use in games. The studio's forthcoming multiplayer game Breakaway will be the first title to use Stream+. Breakaway is Amazon's answer to rival studios Blizzard, Valve and Riot, which have all developed similar team-based battle games. ""Over recent years Amazon has invested significantly into its first-party games development capability but has yet to make a commercial impact on the market,"" said Piers Harding-Rolls of the IHS Markit consultancy. ""Amazon's acquisition of Twitch back in 2014 laid the foundation for the development of its own games that were built from the ground up to engage Twitch viewers. ""Breakaway does look to be an interesting addition to the competitive play arena with it mixing some sports elements with more traditional action elements. We've seen with Rocket League that it's possible to make a break out hit in the esports scene against the incumbent titles."" Mr Gilmore said Stream+ points could be accrued by watching other gamers' video streams on the Twitch website. A demonstration video showed a player betting on the outcome of a Breakaway tournament for the chance to win more points. However, Amazon and Twitch have not revealed exactly how the virtual currency will work. Video games and esports are under close scrutiny from gambling regulators, after unofficial and unlicensed betting websites were developed around popular titles such as Fifa and Counter Strike: Global Offensive. The UK's Gambling Commission has said it is ""paying close attention to the growing popularity of virtual or 'in-game' items, which can be traded, sold or used as virtual currencies to gamble"". The ability for players to buy virtual currency using real money, and the facility to turn virtual coins back into something with ""real world"" value are thought to be an important distinction. Online retail giant Amazon bought Twitch in 2014, in a deal worth $970m (£747m).","Video game streaming site Twitch is to introduce its own virtual ""currency"", says its owner Amazon Game Studios."
"It made the announcement a day after hosting its pop-up privacy experience ""It's Your Facebook"" in New York's Bryant Park. It said several third-party apps had access to ""a broader set of photos than usual"" for 12 days in September. The company said it would notify affected users. It is the latest in a series of data breaches at the social network, which has faced scrutiny following the Cambridge Analytica data scandal. ""When someone gives permission for an app to access their photos on Facebook, we usually only grant the app access to photos people share on their timeline. ""In this case, the bug potentially gave developers access to other photos,"" the company said in a blogpost. It said up to 1,500 apps were affected by the glitch. As well as letting developers access photos on a user's timeline, it gave them access to photos posted in Stories and Marketplace, among other features. It also let them see photos that people had uploaded but not posted on Facebook, for example if they had started writing a post but not finished it. Facebook said it would be working with affected developers to help them ""delete the photos from impacted users"".","Facebook has revealed that a software bug exposed the photos of up to 6.8 million users, including pictures they had not posted."
"China is one of the world's biggest and fastest growing smartphone markets. Motorola's phone business had retreated from the mainland in 2013 after it came under Google's ownership. However, in October last year, China's Lenovo completed the purchase of Motorola Mobility from Google, paving the way for the firm to re-enter the mainland's marketplace. Motorola said three of its products would go on sale from early February, or after the Chinese New Year holiday season, including its Moto X, new Moto X Pro and new Moto G. Not surprising The firm has not yet announced where it will position its products in terms of pricing, but analysts say it will compete against local manufacturers including Xiaomi and Huawei, as well as international brands such as Apple and Samsung. They also said they were not surprised by the move. ""One thing a lot of people have forgotten is that Motorola used to have a 40% share of China's smartphone market,"" Bryan Ma of research firm IDC told the BBC. ""So there may be a residual brand value there they might be able to capitalise on. ""But of course, the market is quite different today, and so the question I have is - will they position themselves as a premium brand?"" Others said the move was a critical one for the Lenovo-owned firm. ""China is a huge market and all mobile players need to be present there,"" Frost & Sullivan's Andrew Milroy told the BBC. ""And it is critical for Lenovo that the firm has a strong position in the Chinese mobile device market,"" he said. Motorola said it would start asking potential customers for feedback about its products from Wednesday, a move Mr Ma said was similar to Xiaomi's business formula. But he said that was where the similarities ended. Motorola said that after the Chinese New Year holiday festival was over, customers would be able to design their own Moto X through the firm's Moto Maker design tool. Mr Milroy said the firm had a smaller number of more high level devices available and that it was likely to pitch them at affluent, young Chinese consumers.

"By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor It said that two of the accidents occurred in Japan this year and the other was in Thailand in 2013. The batteries were sold to Asia-based consumers with two types of laptops - Panasonic's CF-S10 and CF-N10 series - between April and October 2011. However, the company has also announced a separate recall in Europe as a safety precaution. This second callback involves an unspecified number of battery packs sold with its Toughbook CF-H2 tablets between June 2011 and May 2012. ""Because of a manufacturing problem, these particular battery packs may overheat and, in rare instances, cause the notebook to ignite,"" it said in a statement. Jan Kaempfer, a spokesman for Panasonic, told the BBC that the firm was not aware of any cases in which the tablets' batteries had caught fire and that the move was simply a ""precautionary measure"". Conductive materials Panasonic said that no-one had been hurt in any of the Japanese or Thai incidents. It added that it believed the problem might have been caused by conductive materials getting stuck to the batteries' seals, causing them to smoke and catch light after repeated charges. The announcement comes about six weeks after Sony announced a recall of its Vaio Fit 11A laptops because their non-removable battery packs - also manufactured by Panasonic - posed a fire risk. However, Mr Kaempfer said that this was unrelated to the latest recall. Although Panasonic manufactures an adapted type of laptop battery to power Tesla's electric cars, Mr Kaempfer stressed that the batteries involved in the two recalls were different from those used by the US carmaker. Panasonic reported its first annual profit in three years last month, thanks in part to growing demand for its vehicle batteries. The Japanese firm is not the only manufacturer to face such a problem in recent months. In March, Lenovo recalled 117,732 batteries for its ThinkPad laptops, while Summer Infant has had to recall about 800,000 batteries for its baby monitors after it received about two dozen reports of them overheating and smoking.","Panasonic is recalling more than 43,000 laptop battery packs after three of them overheated and caught fire."
"By Zoe KleinmanTechnology reporter, BBC News Stop-motion is a traditional film-making technique that dates back to the 19th Century. It involves using puppet models that are gently repositioned frame by frame to create the illusion of movement. Traditionally, individual facial expressions would be sculpted by hand out of clay, but the producers of ParaNorman built up a library of 8,800 3D-printed faces for the main character alone, which could be used in various sequences, to give him about 1.5 million different expressions. Production house Laika began experimenting with 3D printers in the production of its 2008 film Coraline, in which the lead character managed a comparatively feeble 200,000 expressions. Time saving British animation producers Aardman also used 3D printers in their recent film series The Pirates! ""All shapes need to be modelled on the computer before they are printed, but there's a time saving to be made in terms of animation on set,"" said Stuart Missinger, award leader on the Stop Motion Animation and Puppet Making course at Staffordshire University. ""It means the animator can literally pick and mix from a library of faces. But there's a seam line that runs where a mouth replacement slots in - it goes under the eye, across the bridge of the nose, across the temple. ""If the character has a beard, then the seam line is masked - but if it's visible it needs painting out in post production."" Mr Missinger's colleague, Daryl Marsh is senior lecturer in stop motion at the same university. He admits the technique isn't to the taste of every potential animator. ""We try to push the students to try it out,"" he said. ""A lot of stop-motion is craft-based so they prefer working with their hands but there is some cross-over. When you've done it once, it makes sense - the first time it's confusing."" Printer power Brian McLean is creative supervisor of replacement animation and engineering at the Rapid-Prototype department of Laika. Laika says 3.77 tonnes of printer powder were used by the four printers working on ParaNorman. They worked a total of 572 days, churning out faces from the lower eyelids down to the chins of the main characters. ""There are super-glue and powder elements as part of the process. But the resin is liquid and it's sprayed by multiple heads in a given printer onto a water-soluble powder-based support material, which is the foundation for the entire process,"" said Mr McLean. ""Though they look like sugar cookies from the oven when they emerge, there's no residue when the support material washes away."" Sometimes the printers made mistakes - one scene in which two characters fall into each other and their faces blend was the result of a printer malfunction. ""The solution of purposefully printing the two characters' faces together came to us after a mistake from one of the printers, where a bunch of faces were printed on top of one another. Whenever there's a mistake in the process, we look at it and wonder, 'Could we utilize that?' In this case, it made for a cool effect."" Mr McLean also has a response for any purists who may believe the new technology takes the skill of stop motion away from its roots. ""The 3D Printers are the connection between computers and stop-motion,"" he said. ""Cutting-edge computer-generated starts it, and hand-made practicality - the signature of the stop-motion art form - finishes it.""","Lights... camera... 3D colour printer. During the making of ParaNorman, a new stop-motion animation film released this week in the UK, four 3D printers were essential members of the crew."
"US organisations are allowed to publish the total number of data requests, but cannot break the figure down to reveal the number made by security services. Linkedin said the legal situation ""makes no sense"". Many other technology companies agree. Linkedin, based in Mountain View, California, published its half-yearly Transparency Report on Monday covering the period from 1 January to 30 June. The report said the company had received 83 government requests for data over the six-month period - 70 from the US government. But because Linkedin wanted to break the US figure down into types of request, such as ""subpoena"" or ""search warrant"", it had to exclude the number of national security-related requests. In a letter to members on Tuesday, Erika Rottenberg, Linkedin vice-president, said the ban was ""the source of great disappointment and frustration to us"", arguing that the requirements ""are not legally warranted and make no sense"". The company supports the Digital Due Process Coalition in calling for reform of the US Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA), which dates from 1986. The coalition, which includes big technology companies such as Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft, argues that the ECPA has been outpaced by the rapid rise of the internet and the explosion of digital data. As a result, an individual's right to privacy is being undermined, it argues. ""Linkedin strongly believes that all data, whether analog or digital, whether stored on personal computers or in the cloud, is subject to full US constitution fourth amendment protection, no less than documents stored in a file cabinet or in a desk drawer,"" Ms Rottenberg wrote. The fourth amendment to the US constitution states: ""The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause."" Linkedin's legal challenge takes the form of a petition in the US Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court seeking the ability to publish the number of national security-related data requests. It has also filed a so-called amicus brief in the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.","Linkedin, the business networking service, has mounted a legal challenge to the US government's ban on disclosing the number of national security-related data requests it receives."
"Richard ""Dick"" Barnes helped to create the Harwell Dekatron, which was first put to use in 1951 by Britain's fledgling nuclear research establishment. He was also involved in the 2.5-tonne machine's restoration, which saw it switched back on in 2012. Mr Barnes died aged 98 on 8 April, The National Museum of Computing said. He and two colleagues, Ted Cooke-Yarborough and Gurney Thomas, began their work on the Harwell Dekatron in 1949. It was initially used by the Atomic Energy Research Establishment in Oxfordshire, where its tasks involved solving equations used to design the structure supporting the world's first commercial nuclear reactor at Calder Hall. 'Witch' In 1957, the computer was acquired by Wolverhampton and Staffordshire Technical College. It was used to teach computing there for 16 years and earned the nickname ""Witch"", or ""Wolverhampton Instrument for Teaching Computation from Harwell"". ""All the early computer designers faced the problems of storing data, so we selected dekatrons, a ready-made storage device for one decimal digit,"" Mr Barnes said in 2012. Dekatrons were gas-filled tubes that were used as counting devices in some early digital computers. Rows of them could be used to store numbers in the computer's memory so that calculations could be carried out. In November 2012 the machine was successfully switched back on after a three-year restoration project. The revived machine functioned as planned, which is to say, very slowly. It could take up to 10 seconds to multiply two numbers - but Mr Barnes and his co-designers had wanted a machine that could run continuously, not necessarily quickly, in order to be useful. Indeed, it was known to calculate continuously for periods of up to 80 hours. Delwyn Holroyd, of the Harwell Dekatron restoration team, said Mr Barnes had taken ""a keen interest"" in the project. ""Dick was responsible for the complex relay logic, which he designed on paper without the benefit of the tools we take for granted nowadays and with very little prior art to draw upon,"" he said. ""The compactness, elegance and reliability of the resulting design is a fitting tribute to his skill.""",One of the co-designers of a machine later recognised as the world's oldest working digital computer has died.
"Mr Jones is currently banned from YouTube for violating the site's policy on abusive behaviour. He is also banned from many other social platforms for breaking conditions governing such behaviour.

A two-hour chat with Mr Jones features on the Logan Paul podcast channel, which currently has about 1.4 million subscribers, many of whom are in their teens and 20s. Legal action During the wide-ranging interview Mr Paul laughs and jokes with Mr Jones about his widely contested beliefs, at one point going along with Mr Jones's claim that former US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton is ""crazy"". However, Mr Paul does challenge Mr Jones, who is being sued for defamation by parents of children killed during the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting, on his views on the massacre, saying his view of it as a hoax could ""become something dangerous"". Joe Mulhall, senior researcher at Hope Not Hate, criticised the decision to record and air the talk. ""Paul seems to have given a platform to an extremist simply to generate more views and appears to have portrayed his guest as an amusement,"" he said. He added: ""Paul described Jones as ""a far-right conspiracy theorist"" and yet still decided to have him on his show, meaning he knew what he was doing and seemingly didn't seem to care.""

"The Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation, the patent licensing arm of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said the verdict was important to guard its inventions from unauthorised use. The jury had earlier decided that Apple incorporated patented microchip technology into some iPhones and iPads without permission. Apple said it would appeal. The company declined to comment further. The amount was less than the foundation had claimed. It had originally sought as much as $862m. The sum was lower in part because the judge ruled that Apple had not wilfully infringed the patent. University of Wisconsin-Madison computer sciences professor Gurindar Sohi, one of the inventors of the microchip technology - designed to boost the performance of computer processors - was in the federal court in Madison, Wisconsin, for the decision. ""For Dr Sohi, I hope you felt that your invention was vindicated,'' US District Judge William Conley said. 'Seminal work' Carl Gulbrandsen, managing director of the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation, said: ""This is a case where the hard work of our university researchers and the integrity of patenting and licensing discoveries has prevailed. ""The jury recognised the seminal computer processing work that took place on our campus.'' The case relates to use of the technology in the iPhone 5s, 6 and 6 Plus - but an additional lawsuit making the same claim against Apple's newest models, the 6S and 6S Plus, has also been filed. The University of Wisconsin sued Intel over the same patent in 2008. That case was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum. Despite recent well-publicised truces between some big tech firms, fierce patent battles are still being fought in courts globally. A judge recently threw out claims by graphic card specialist Nvidia that Samsung and others had infringed three of its patents. Apple's annual revenue in 2014 was $182bn.",A US jury has ordered technology giant Apple to pay more than $234m (£152m) in damages for patent infringement.
"The study said homes on Greenmeadows Park averaged just 0.14 megabits per second (Mbps). The fastest spot, by contrast, is said to offer speeds that are nearly 1,900 times faster. It was named as Abdon Avenue in Birmingham, where the average speed was recorded as being 265.89Mbps. For the sake of comparison, those figures suggest it would take users five minutes 42 seconds to download all five episodes of Sir David Attenborough's Dynasties series in high definition in Abdon Avenue, but more than seven days in Greenmeadows Park. Of note, the Gloucestershire street is only about one mile (1.6km) away from GCHQ, the communications-focussed intelligence agency, which has some of the fastest internet access of all. The research was carried out by the price comparison service uSwitch, which said it was based on more than 279,000 real-world speed tests by members of the public. However, the team behind a rival service has criticised the company's methodology, and it appears that Greenmeadows Park's residents do have access to much faster speeds. The government has promised homes and businesses will have a legal right to a minimum of 10Mbps from 2020. 'Postcode lottery' USwitch said its results suggested the average speed in the UK was now 46.2Mbps, but added that about 13% of homes had speeds below 5Mbps. Five of the country's fastest streets were found to be in the South West - in Devon, Dorset, Cornwall and Wiltshire. Meanwhile, nine of the slowest streets were said to be in areas north of the River Mersey - including North Yorkshire, South Yorkshire, Greater Manchester, Merseyside and Scotland. In some cases the firm said it was a ""postcode lottery"" as to whether users had abnormally fast or slow access, but in others it said there were ways to get a better service, such as moving to a ""full-fibre"" connection. ""Over a third of the slowest streets have access to superfast speeds, so people living there have no need to be crawling along on completely unusable internet services,"" said spokeswoman Dani Warner. Greenmeadows Park residents may be among those who are unaware of the choices on offer. A property on sale in the street is currently advertised as offering speeds of ""up to 2Mbps"", while BT's own speed-checker claims they stretch ""up to 3.5Mbps"". But Gloucestershire County Council has tweeted that the rural broadband provider Gigaclear also offers an ""ultrafast"" gigabit service. 'Misleading results' Thinkbroadband uses crowdsourced data to create its own map of the country. It has reviewed some of uSwitch's findings and suggests they contain anomalies as well as being misleading. It says some streets' speeds have been recorded as being faster than any local service could provide, while others appear to be very slow despite speedy fibre-to-the-premises connections being on offer. ""They need to distinguish between slow streets and streets that are slow because no-one has upgraded,"" commented Thinkbroadbrand's editor Andrew Ferguson. ""Essentially the study is great PR for uSwitch's website but is poorly researched,"" he said. Even so, he acknowledged the publication served as a reminder to customers to check if faster broadband had become available since they had signed up to their current deal. And he added that households with slow connections should also check if they would be better served by switching to a 4G-based connection now that several of the networks were offering ""unlimited data"" deals.","A village street in Bamfurlong, Gloucestershire, has been named as the slowest for broadband internet, according to an annual survey."
"Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent@BBCRoryCJon Twitter The team behind the device was awarded the Royal Academy of Engineering's MacRobert Prize at a ceremony in London last night. The tiny computer launched in 2012. Its designers hoped to introduce children to coding and had modest ambitions. They beat two other finalists, cyber-security company Darktrace and radiotherapy pioneers Vision RT, to win the prize. Previous winners of the innovation award, which has been run since 1969, include the creators of the CT (computerised tomography) scanner; the designers of the Severn Bridge; and the team at Microsoft in Cambridge that developed the Kinect motion sensor. Exceeded expectations A tiny cheap computer that might encourage youngsters to learn programming was the idea of a small team of scientists and Cambridge University academics. They hoped to sell a few thousand units, but sales have now passed 14 million, and the Pi is widely used in factories as well as in classrooms and homes. One of the MacRobert award judges, Dr Frances Saunders, said a small engineering team had redefined home computing. ""The Raspberry Pi team has achieved something that mainstream multinational computer companies and leading processing chip designers not only failed to do, but failed even to spot a need for,"" she said. Back in 2011, computing academic Eben Upton and games designer David Braben came to the BBC to show me an early prototype of the Raspberry Pi. The video I shot on my phone of the device went viral, proving the potential appetite for the computer. I caught up with Eben Upton, now the chief executive of Raspberry Pi Trading Ltd, as he was arriving in London for last night's award ceremony, not yet knowing that his team had won. ""This is the big one,"" he told me. ""It would be a validation of the fact that we have built something bigger than we ever envisaged. It would also be recognition of the extraordinary community we've built around the Pi."" The Raspberry Pi is now the best selling British computer in history. It sailed past the Amstrad and Sinclair's ZX Spectrum some years ago, helped by the launch of an even more minimalist model the Pi Zero. What is extraordinary is just how successful it has become in industry, where it's finding a place in all sorts of applications, from robotics to smart signage systems. This area now accounts for nearly half of all Raspberry Pi sales. Last week, it emerged that Intel had quietly cancelled three devices aimed at competing with its tiny rival in this area. Eben Upton says that, after selling so many, his organisation now has an advantage over new entrants because it has ironed out all the early kinks. ""We still see it as a toy - it just happens to be a toy that's rather well made,"" he said. For all its commercial success, the Raspberry Pi's core mission remains education. It has recently merged with CoderDojo, making it the largest global coding teaching organisation. In the early days, it seemed that the device appealed more to middle-aged nostalgic hobbyists than to children, who found it hard to get to grips with something that did not fit their idea of a computer. Now, with ample funds at their disposal and recognition of their engineering expertise, the Raspberry Pi team can step up their drive to transform attitudes to computing.",The Raspberry Pi has won the UK's top engineering award.
"The leak, which includes correspondence between staff at BoA subsidiary Balboa Insurance, details plans to delete sensitive documents. It does not explain why the files were to be removed or how this supports Anonymous' accusation of criminality. Bank of America has denied wrongdoing and called the claims ""extravagant"". The company has been subject of rumours that its secrets would be leaked online for months. But it was expected that Wikileaks would publish the secret documents, not a site associated with Anonymous. Wikileaks connection In late 2010, Wikileaks founder Julian Assange said he planned to release documents in early 2011, which could bring down a well known bank. Previously, he had claimed to be in possession of a hard drive containing internal documents from a senior Bank of America official. The Wikileaks release has yet to appear, and it is unclear if those files are the same ones obtained by Anonymous. One of the documents appears to show an employee of Bilboa Insurance asking a colleague to delete certain loan identifying numbers from their computer system. No information is given about the reason for the deletion, or whether it was ultimately carried out. An Anonymous member, posting updates on Twitter under the name OperationLeakS said the e-mails form the first part of a series of planned leaks that will prove Bank of America engaged in improper mortgage foreclosure practices. But BoA said the clerical and administration documents do not relate to foreclosures. ""We are confident that his extravagant assertions are untrue,"" a BoA spokesman said. Leaked e-mails The e-mails were initially posted online online at http://bankofamericasuck.com. That website has only been available intermittently, having been overwhelmed by requests. Subsequently, sites mirroring the content have sprung up and the documents have also been released through peer-to-peer networks. However, some of the torrents, such as the one hosted on the Pirate Bay, have been removed. Anonymous members have engaged in a campaign of action against websites and companies that assisted the United States government in its attempt to isolate Wikileaks. It has previously posted internal e-mails from computer security company HBGary and launched denial of service attacks against PayPal and Visa. The leaked HBGary e-mails proved highly damaging to the firm, containing details of its secret work with several high-profile clients. Bank of America stopped handling payments for Wikileaks, after it published leaked US embassy cables. Firms are increasingly concerned about the prospect of disgruntled staff taking caches of sensitive e-mails with them when they leave, said Rami Habal, of security firm Proofpoint. ""You can't do anything about people copying the content,"" he said. But firms can put measures in place, such as revoking encryption keys, which means stolen e-mails become unreadable, he added.",Online activist group Anonymous has released a cache of e-mails which it claims show impropriety at Bank of America.

Compulsory changes to Instagram's terms of service are due to come into effect on 16 January, The originally proposed new wording that caused the controversy included: ""You hereby grant to Instagram a non-exclusive, fully paid and royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license to use the content that you post on or through the service."" The terms also stated that ""a business or other entity may pay us to display your username, likeness, photos, and/or actions you take, in connection with paid or sponsored content or promotions, without any compensation to you.""

"Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent@BBCRoryCJon Twitter That could be the outcome of a government consultation on strict new drone safety rules. There could also be tougher penalties for anyone who flies a drone in a no-fly zone, with the possibility of a new criminal offence of misuse of a drone. Drone use has become widespread in the past few years, with drones available cheaply in high street shops. The government says drones have enormous economic potential and are already being used by everyone from the emergency services and conservation groups to energy and transport firms. But the Aviation Minister, Lord Ahmad, said while the vast majority of drone users were law-abiding, ""some are not aware of the rules or choose to break them putting public safety, privacy and security at risk"". There are already strict regulations for all drone users. Any drone with a camera cannot be flown within 50 metres of buildings, vehicles, people or over large crowds. Anyone using a drone for commercial purposes has to register with the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). But now leisure users may have to register their drones and perhaps undertake a test similar to the driving theory test. This will apply to any drone weighing over 250g (0.55lb) - which covers just about anything more than a toy. Simon Dale, of the FPV group for drone pilots, is unhappy about any plan to make leisure users register. ""It will impact the safe and sensible drone fliers and will not affect criminals or terrorists,"" he said. Drone users could have to pay a hefty fee, Mr Dale fears: ""Setting up a drone equivalent of the DVLA is likely to be costly."" Leisure drone user Peter Galbavy said the regulations were already too complex and badly framed. ""What really annoys me is the different rules for drones with or without cameras,"" he said. ""It's nothing to do with privacy - it's an assumption that the drone will be much heavier and can drop on people's heads - which is no longer true."" But concerns about safety have risen. Jonathan Nicholson, from the Civil Aviation Authority, said: ""We do see a rise in the number of near misses reported by airline pilots, and we have had complaints from members of the public about drones being flown too close to them, which the police receive."" He urged users to familiarise themselves with the CAA's Drone Code. The government says the drone industry could be worth billions by 2025. But ministers believe it will only be a success if it is done safely, and with the consent of the public. Drone developments The UK's proposed safety test is just one of a flurry of drone-related developments in recent days. Others include:",Anyone who buys a drone in future in the UK may have to register it and take a safety test.
"Alex Stamos scolded the security industry in the opening keynote of the 2017 Black Hat conference. He said there was too much focus on technically complex ""stunt"" hacks and not enough on finding ways to help the mass of people stay safe. The problem would only worsen if the industry did not become more diverse and exhibit more empathy, he said. No spies ""We have perfected the art of finding problems without fixing real world issues,"" he told attendees. ""We focus too much on complexity, not harm."" He cited examples of technically brilliant presentations at the show, such as insulin pumps being hacked, that had little relation to real issues experienced by people who use technology rather than work with it or understand it well. Cyber-hacks season: Also, he said, the security industry concentrated too much on the small number of complex hack attacks aimed at large corporations that were mounted by the most sophisticated adversaries. By contrast, he said, most Facebook users who lost data were not being targeted by spies or nation-states. ""The things that we see, that we come across every day, that cause people to lose control of their information are not that advanced,"" he said. ""Adversaries will do the simplest thing they need to do to make an attack work."" The lack of focus on those more mundane problems came about because often security experts had little interest in or empathy for people, he said. This attitude was exemplified by the thought he often heard security pros express that there would be fewer breaches and less data lost if people were perfect, he added. Instead, Mr Stamos said, it would be better if the industry tried to work with those imperfections by giving people tools and services that were more straight-forward to use. Reflect diversity This lack of empathy also showed itself in the way many in the industry reacted when real world issues bumped up against security. This was evident in the way Facebook subsidiary WhatsApp rolled out end-to-end encryption, he said. The security team at WhatsApp who developed the system had to make ""difficult choices"" about how they implemented it to make it easier to use. However, he added, this led to vigorous criticism by many cyber experts who said the usability trade-offs fundamentally broke the system and limited its ability to protect messages. That was not the case, he said, but many commentators did not appreciate why WhatsApp pursued the course it did. Wrong people These blind spots could be tackled by the security industry becoming more tolerant and diverse, he said. Facebook had set up initiatives that sought to make its workforce more balanced and which encouraged people with non-technical backgrounds to get involved in developing secure systems, products and features. ""Things are not getting better, they are getting worse,"" he said. ""That's because we do not have enough people and not the right people to make the difference."" The growing importance and influence of cyber-security meant the industry had a real chance to improve peoples' lives, he said. ""We have the world's attention, now we have to ask what we are going to do with it."" This week BBC News is taking a close look at all aspects of cyber-security. The coverage is timed to coincide with the two biggest shows in the security calendar - Black Hat and Def Con.

"By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor It says Starcraft 2 had posed a tougher AI challenge than chess and other board games, in part because opponents' pieces were often hidden from view. Publication in the peer-reviewed journal Nature allows the London-based lab to claim a new milestone. But some pro-gamers have mixed feelings about it claiming Grandmaster status. DeepMind - which is owned by Google's parent company Alphabet - said the development of AlphaStar would help it develop other AI tools which should ultimately benefit humanity. ""One of the key things we're really excited about is that Starcraft raises a lot of challenges that you actually see in real-world problems,"" said Dave Silver, who leads the lab's reinforcement learning research group. ""We see Starcraft as a benchmark domain to understand the science of AI, and advance in our quest to build better AI systems."" DeepMind says that examples of technologies that might one day benefit from its new insights include robots, self-driving cars and virtual assistants, which all need to make decisions based on ""imperfectly observed information"". How do you play Starcraft 2? In one-on-one games, two players compete against each other after choosing which alien race to be. Each of the three options - Zerg, Protoss and Terran - has different abilities. Players start with only a few pieces and must gather resources - minerals and gasses - which can be used to make new buildings and create technologies. They can also invest time increasing their number of worker units. Gamers can only see a small section of the map at a time, and they can only point the in-game ""camera"" to an area if some of their units are based there or have travelled to it. When ready, players can send out scouting parties to reveal their enemy's preparations, or alternatively go straight ahead and launch attacks. All of this happens in real-time, and players do not take turns to make moves. As the action picks up pace, gamers typically have to juggle hundreds of units and structures, and make choices that might only pay off minutes later. Part of the challenge is the huge amount of choice on offer. At any time, there are up to 100 trillion trillion possible moves, and thousands of such choices must be taken before it becomes apparent who has overwhelmed the others' buildings and won. How did DeepMind approach the problem? DeepMind trained three separate neural networks - one for each race of aliens it played as. To start with, it tapped into a vast database of past games provided by Starcraft's developer Blizzard. This was used to train its agents to imitate the moves of the strongest players. Copies of these agents were then pitted against each other to hone their skills via a technique known as reinforcement learning. They also created ""exploiter agents"", whose job it was to expose weaknesses in the main agents' strategies, so as to let them find ways to correct them. Prof Silver likened these subsidiary agents to ""sparring partners"" and said they forced the main agents to adopt more robust strategies than would otherwise have been the case. This all took place across 44 days. But because the process was carried out at high speed, it represented about 200 years of human gameplay. The resulting three neural networks were then pitted against human players on Blizzard's Battle.net platform, without their identity being revealed until after each game, to see if they would triumph. What was the result? The lab said its neural networks attained Grandmaster status for each of the three alien races - the ranking given to the top players in each region of the world. But it acknowledged there were still about 50 to 100 people who still outperform AlphaStar on Battle.net. Is this really about developing AI to fight wars? DeepMind has pledged never to develop technologies for lethal autonomous weapons. Prof Silver said the work on Starcraft 2 did not change that. ""To say that this has any kind of military use is saying no more than to say an AI for chess could be used to lead to military applications,"" he added. ""Our goal is to try and build general purpose intelligences [but] there are deeper ethical questions which have to be answered by the community."" It is noteworthy that after DeepMind beat South Korea's top Go player in 2016, the Chinese military published a document saying the achievement highlighted ""the enormous potential of artificial intelligence in combat command"". Beijing subsequently announced its intention to overtake the US and become the world's leader in AI by 2030. What do gamers think? Raza ""RazerBlader"" Sekha is one of the UK's top three Starcraft 2 pros. He played as a Terran against AlphaStar and also watched its matches against others. He said the neural networks were ""impressive"", but suggested it still had quirks. ""There was one game where someone went for a very weird [army] composition, made up of purely air units - and AlphaStar didn't really know how to respond,"" he recalled. ""It didn't adapt its play and ended up losing. ""That's interesting because good players tend to play more standard styles, while it's the weaker players who often play weirdly."" Joshua ""RiSky"" Hayward is the UK's top player. He did not get to play AlphaStar but has studied games it played as a Zerg. He believes its behaviour was atypical for a Grandmaster. ""It often didn't make the most efficient, strategic decisions,"" he remarked, ""but it was very good at executing its strategy and doing lots of things all at once, so it still got to a decent level. ""When AI got better than people at chess, it did so by making abnormal moves that ended up being stronger than those played by humans. I feel that DeepMind needed more time to create its own innovations and it will be a bit disappointing if the project doesn't continue."" One AI expert who has previously expressed scepticism about other deep learning-related claims, also had reservations about the latest findings. ""These kind of techniques may yet prove to have some important commercial value, but they depend on massive amounts of data in situations, like games, that are very stable,"" commented Gary Marcus, co-founder of Robust.AI. ""So far the field has struggled to take techniques like this out of the laboratory and game environments and into the real world, and i don't immediately see this result as progress in that direction."" Didn't DeepMind previously show AI doesn't need to learn from humans? The ""zero"" versions of the lab's Chess, Go and Shogi-playing agents did indeed perform better when they relied on reinforcement learning alone. But DeepMind said Starcraft 2 was too complex for this to be practical, at least at this point. Discovering new strategies without any guide would be a ""needle in a haystack problem,"" Prof Silver said, with the agent required to stumble upon a series of steps with a beneficial outcome. ""You'd have to do so many unlikely things, each of which in turn looks really bad from where you are,"" he explained. ""We call this the exploration problem. ""There's still an open research question, as to how to do something like AlphaStar Zero, which could fully learn for itself without human data."" What next? DeepMind says it hopes the techniques used to develop AlphaStar will ultimately help it ""advance our research in real-world domains"". But Prof Silver said the lab ""may rest at this point"", rather than try to get AlphaStar to the level of the very elite players.",DeepMind says it has created the first artificial intelligence to reach the top league of one of the most popular esport video games.
"A raffle by regulator Icann has placed them near the top of the list of applications it will review. Of the proposed new geographic suffixes, Wales's .cymru will be one of the first to be evaluated. However, .scot and .irish are likely to have to wait until 2014. The first domains to go live could enjoy an early-mover advantage. The list of 1,917 generic top-level domains (gTLDs) applications was determined by the order tickets were randomly pulled out of drums at a hotel in Los Angeles on Monday. Companies were charged a $100 (£62) fee for each application they they wanted in the draw. In some cases they decided not to take part. As a result several of Google's submissions will be among those last to be judged. Same names An early evaluation is not an absolute guarantee a suffix will go live early. Governments have lodged ""early objections"" to more than 250 of them - meaning the proposed address may be rejected. In addition, several companies are competing for identical gTLDs. So, for example. Amazon's application for .play is near the top of the list. But it faces having to wait for a submission for the same name from Star Registry - which is 1,792nd in order - to be reviewed and a potential auction held if both are approved before the suffix can be activated. Icann's raffle did not go without glitch. At one point a live feed of the event failed causing the organisers to temporarily halt the process to ensure it remained transparent. The event ended up lasting more than nine hours - significantly longer than planned. Tickets for about 100 non-Latin applications were picked from the drums first, placing a submission for the equivalent of .church in Chinese from the Vatican at the top of the list. It was followed by the Japanese for .store by Amazon. Of the English-language proposals, unique applications set for an early review include .delmonte from the American food company; .mormon from a firm called IRI Domain Management; .fiat from the car company; and .joy from Amazon. First movers Businesses and other users will be able to apply to run websites using the new address suffixes in cases where the new owner decides it does not want to restrict its use. They will be able to do so so by applying to domain name registration services which will act as middle-men, charging a fee which will be shared with the owner. One UK-based registrar said that the initial new gTLDs to go live would benefit from their early start. ""Those that go first will get a lot more marketing opportunities,"" Kelly Salter from names.co.uk told the BBC. ""At the moment there are relatively few extensions to choose from that give you global coverage - so there is the opportunity to get great exposure. ""But if you're number 500 to be approved, our customers will have become desensitised by that point. So the impact to domains launching towards the end of the process will be that they have to work harder to make people want to use them."" Icann has said it plans to let the first batch of new gTLDs in May 2013. Ms Salter said after the launch date she expected about 20 would be released each week with the final ones going live before the end of 2014.","Proposed net address endings .tattoo, .transformers and .menu are among the first that could go live next year."
"By Dave LeeTechnology reporter, BBC News The dongle is plugged into a television's HDMI port, and allows users to stream media from smartphones, tablets and computers. Launching immediately in the US, the device will cost $35 (£23). There is as yet no word on international launches. Google also announced an upgraded Nexus 7 tablet, the first to run the new version of the Android system. Failed attempts Chromecast is Google's latest attempt to gain ground in the television industry. In 2012, Google faltered in its attempts to make a move into the living room, considered by many experts to be ripe ground for making large profits through advertising. Google's partnership with Sony, with which it released a £200 set-top box, was poorly received. That attempt followed an even earlier false start in 2010 when it launched Google TV, a service that was blocked by several TV networks, and suffered greatly from requiring consumers to buy expensive hardware. More recently, the orb-shaped Nexus Q device, announced last year, fell flat almost immediately - Google pulled it from sale in response to ""feedback"". With Chromecast, Google is attempting to simplify its large-screen offering, focusing on streaming clips from services such as YouTube and Netflix via a far cheaper device. The dongle plugs into a television's HDMI port, and uses wireless home internet to link to devices. However, unlike other similar devices, such as Apple TV, the media is streamed from the cloud, rather than from the mobile device itself. This, Google said, allowed for higher-quality streaming, and had less impact on battery life. The search giant was especially keen to stress the dongle's ability to stream across multiple operating systems, be it Android or Apple's iOS. This aspect in particular is central to Google's core strategy, said Gartner analyst Carolina Milanesi. ""It's a big departure from the Nexus Q,"" she told the BBC. ""What it boils down to is a focus around YouTube - and getting people back into that ecosystem. ""If you look at the opportunities around advertising, they're getting eyeballs back to that."" New Nexus Also shown off at the event was Google's updated Nexus 7 tablet, which will go on sale in the ""coming weeks"". The tablet will be the first to run Android 4.3, the latest iteration of the Jelly Bean flavour of Google's mobile operating system. Among the software's new features will be the ability to set restricted profiles, meaning parents can, for example, only give their child access to certain functions on a device. The Asus-built device is slightly smaller, and 50g (1.8oz) lighter, than the original Nexus 7, which was launched last year. The new device will have a screen resolution higher than any in its class, boasting 323 pixels per inch. That is significantly higher than the iPad Mini's 163ppi and the 7in Kindle Fire HD's 216ppi. But Jason Jenkins, from technology website Cnet, said it still had a lot of ground to make up with consumers. ""I am not convinced that ordinary consumers will respond better to this tablet than the last one,"" he said. ""Apple has established such momentum, Google's real challenge isn't just making a better tablet than Apple, it's persuading ordinary people to care that it makes one at all."" The new Nexus 7 will cost $30 more than it predecessor at $229 (£150), with other international prices yet to be announced. The price point keeps it in line with Amazon's Kindle Fire, another key competitor - and considerably cheaper than Apple's iPad Mini, which retails starting at $329, or £269 in the UK.

"By Rory Cellan-Jones & Zoe KleinmanTechnology reporters The contact-tracing app - covering England and Wales - launched on 24 September. The Department for Health and Social Care has emphasised that using it is voluntary. It also says the guidance the app issues about whether to self-isolate or get a test is not enforceable by law. The app itself may look simple, but it has thrown up lots of questions about how it works and what its limits are. Here's our attempt to answer some of your queries: Why can't I log out of a location after I've logged in? One feature of the app is its ability to scan a QR barcode to log in at a pub, restaurant or other location - an alternative to actually handing over your contact details to that business on a paper log, website or alternative system (though in Wales you still need to do both). But people have noticed that while you can log in you cannot log out, and even if you soon leave the app thinks you are still there until midnight unless you log in somewhere else. The point however of the QR scan is just to register your presence at that location rather than your proximity to someone infectious, which is registered via the Bluetooth contact-tracing feature. If the location is later identified as a virus hotspot then an alert may be sent out to anyone who scanned a QR code there - not to self-isolate, but to be on the lookout for any symptoms of the virus. But you cannot be alerted that somebody arrived in the pub hours after you left, and they later tested positive, because your phones could not have been physically close to each other at the same time. Why can't I input a negative test result? On Friday it emerged that some test results were arriving without the code needed to register them in the app. By Saturday evening the Department of Health said codes would now be provided with all positive test results, via a phone call from the contact tracing team. But some are asking why there isn't a code for a negative result, especially as a self-isolation countdown begins as soon as someone registers that they have symptoms. There seem to be a couple of answers. If you've been told to self-isolate because you have been in contact with an infected person, then you are supposed to do so regardless of whether you test negative yourself. If you are the potentially infected person, then nobody will be notified via the app without a positive result. However, it does mean you have to live with the timer as it cannot be de-activated - but as we said, adhering to this is not legally enforceable. Then there's the fact that the intention is that you now arrange your test via the app after reporting symptoms. In this case, the results - positive, negative or void, (which means a retest is needed) - will be registered automatically in the app without any need to enter a code. Why doesn't the location change when I move around? When you first download the app it asks for part of your postcode. You then get a message on the homescreen telling you what the risk level in your area is. Why doesn't this change when you move somewhere - for instance when a student leaves home to go to university? Right at the beginning of the app's development, privacy campaigners expressed concern about the government tracking people - and a promise was made that location tracking would not be a feature of this app. There is however a way of changing that postcode without reinstalling the app. Go to ""About this app"", then ""Manage my data"" and you will then be able to edit your postcode. Why doesn't it work on my phone? A number of people - in particular those with iPhones earlier than the 6S which went on sale in 2015 - are finding that they are unable to install the app on their phone. This is not due to a decision by the app's developers but is a limitation imposed by Apple and Google. They have designed the toolkit on which this and many other contact-tracing apps around the world are based - and they have determined that older phones would not be suitable for running the technology behind the app. The tech companies say that older phones cannot run the Bluetooth technology required by the app effectively. I get notifications which then disappear - what's going on? A number of people have reported getting notifications about exposure to the virus and then not being able to find out what they need to do next. Some are confused because of the way they are written - including the phrase ""exposure date, duration and signal strength have been saved"". It appears that this again may be connected to the Apple-Google system, which sometimes sends out what are called exposure notifications. Here's what the FAQ from the app team says about this issue: ""These are default messages from Apple and Google. There is no need to be concerned if you miss or overlook them, they are just visible to remind you that the functionality is on and working. You're currently not able to turn off these default Apple and Google notifications. ""Important messages from the NHS Covid-19 app will always be visible to you from inside the app."" Like other apps, NHS Covid-19 will get updates and new features. And the NHS is inviting people to send in any feedback about problems they have faced or features which could improve the app.",The Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said the NHS Covid-19 app had been downloaded 12.4 million times as of noon.
"Dave LeeNorth America technology reporter According to the New York Times, the Red Sox used the device to receive messages about what kind of pitch was about to be thrown. That information was then relayed from the dug-out to the batter - giving him an advantage. It is unclear what kind of punishment Boston’s beloved team might receive following the investigation. The team is currently top of the American League Eastern division. MLB did not return the BBC’s request for comment on Tuesday. Nor did the Red Sox or the New York Yankees - the team whose complaint provoked the probe. The Yankees provided video from a three-game series that took place in August. Predicting pitches In baseball, the catcher, crouched behind the batter, will signal to the pitcher what kind of ball should be thrown, such as a fast ball or slider. Typically, the catcher will hold up a number of fingers to relay that message. These signals - known as signs - would be very useful to the batter if he could see them, but he’s looking in the other direction, using only the pitcher’s posture and grip for guidance. Stealing signs, as the practice is known, involves a team member seeing the opponent's signal and somehow relaying that information to the batter in the short window before the ball is thrown. The MLB investigation found the Red Sox would have an off-field person watching a camera feed of the catcher. He would then contact the dug-out via the Apple Watch, and that signal would be passed on from the dug-out to the batter. The New York Times report said MLB will now look to see if the Red Sox had used the technique in other games. ‘Rethink' Stealing signs by analogue means - such as a team mate at second base seeing the catcher and revealing the signal to the batter opposite - is legal. But using a devices such as binoculars or electronics to aid the process is not. Teams have long used ingenious ways to steal signs, including in 1951 when the New York Giants’ Bobby Thomson hit a series-winning home run, a hit later dubbed the “shot heard round the world”. It was revealed some years later that the Giants had a team member in the club house opposite using a telescope to spot signs. Joel Sherman, a baseball columnist for the New York Post, said on Twitter that MLB must clamp down on mischievous uses of technology in the sport. ""MLB must rethink how it polices tech use. Perhaps no electronics at all in dugout,” he wrote. ""Also, teams might have to rethink how signs are given on field by going to verbal signals or eliminating putting fingers down as the lone way to convey pitch selection.” ___________ Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC You can reach Dave securely through encrypted messaging app Signal on: +1 (628) 400-7370","The Boston Red Sox used an Apple Watch illicitly to gain the upper hand in a recent game, a Major League Baseball (MLB) investigation has reportedly found."
"London had the highest number of monochrome licences, at 2,715, followed by Birmingham and Manchester, it said. The number of licences issued each year has dwindled from 212,000 in 2000. A total of 13,202 monochrome licences were in force at the start of 2013. A black-and-white TV licence costs £49 a year, a colour licence costs £145.50. TV Licensing spokesman Stephen Farmer said: ""It's remarkable that with the digital switchover complete, 41% of UK households owning HDTVs and Britons leading the world in accessing TV content over the internet, more than 13,000 households still watch their favourite programmes on a black-and-white telly."" Television and radio technology historian John Trenouth said their continued use could largely be explained by low-income households wanting to save money on the licence fee. But he added: ""There will always be a small number of users who prefer monochrome images, don't want to throw away a working piece of technology or collect old TV sets. ""Maybe these will still be around in 10 years from now, when the number of black-and-white licences will have fallen to a few hundred - about the same number of black-and-white sets that were in use on the opening night of BBC television 70 years ago"".","More than 13,000 households across the UK are still using black-and-white television sets, according to the TV Licensing authority."
"Dave LeeNorth America technology reporter When TfL, backed by Mayor Sadiq Khan, announced Uber would no longer be allowed to operate, the service's 3.5m users, and 40,000 drivers, were aghast. Despite the very best efforts of the cab trade, Uber has become a valued way for Londoners to get around, particularly late at night. The same was true in Austin, Texas. It’s a city that shares few similarities with London, other than its own bitter tussle with Uber - the fallout from which could contain clues as to what might happen if, and it's a big if, TfL follows through with its threat. Uber had been available in Austin since 2014. But on 10 May 2016, Uber (and rival service Lyft) turned off their apps and left. Less than 24 hours earlier, Austinites had gone to the polls to vote on Proposition 1. It was a law that removed a requirement on ride-sharing companies to gather fingerprints as part of their background checks on drivers, as well as sharing more data with city officials. Uber didn't want to do this. It argued that the fingerprint database drivers would be cross-checked against would be ineffective. It's also likely - though Uber never expressed this publicly - that adding a layer to the sign-up process would make it more time-consuming, and expensive, to recruit drivers. It's something the company, in all the markets it works in, constantly seeks to avoid - and in Austin it was prepared to spend big to avoid the restrictions. Fierce lobbying David Butts, a political consultant who campaigned against Uber during the dispute, estimates that the firm spent more than $10m (£7.5m) fighting city officials. “We have never seen a campaign that spent that much money, for anything,” he said. Uber did not respond to the BBC’s request to comment on this story. Whatever the size of the lobbying bill, it wasn’t enough. Mr Khosrowshahi said Uber’s poor corporate reputation may have been a factor in TfL's thinking, and the same may have been true for Austin’s voters, according to Ben Wear, a reporter for the Austin American-Statesman. ""I think a lot of people that actually actively used their service here in Austin voted against them, knowing that they’d leave, because of the corporate behaviour that at that time had gone on for about two years. ""They showed up and basically ignored the city’s rules."" And so just like that, Uber and Lyft were gone. Alternative apps Andy Tryba and his team got to work. ""We basically stayed up all night for about four weeks or so to kind of get it up and going,"" he told me. “It’s to my knowledge the world’s only non-profit version of ride-share.” He's the co-founder of Ride Austin, a locally developed app that stepped in to take Uber’s place - one of about 11 eventual alternatives that popped up in the weeks and months after Uber's disappearance. Unlike Uber and Lyft, which take a percentage of a ride’s final fare, RideAustin takes a fixed $2 fee, regardless of how long or far the journey. Riders are offered the chance to round up their fare and donate the extra amount to a number of charities - it has so far raised over $250,000. “There were 125,000 a week or so that were occurring in the city when Uber and Lyft were operating here. Obviously, the day that they pulled out there was a bit of an adjustment period. “But within a few weeks, there were several players that came into town. Very quickly that total number of rides were filled by those other players.” Saturday night failure There were teething problems with these new apps, said Mike Allen, who has driven in Austin for almost two years. “It was a fun challenge to get them to a point where they were able to work for us as drivers,” he said. ""But we got there."" The real test came when it was time for the most famous event in Austin’s calendar - South by Southwest. The tech, music and film festival draws thousands to the city every year, and in 2017 it presented the new apps with their biggest challenge yet in handling the demand. That challenge grew too great on the middle Saturday of the festival, when as afternoon rolled into evening, it started to pour down with rain. I was among those hopelessly opening up apps trying to find one that was still working. RideAustin buckled, as too did Fasten, another app that had moved into the city when Uber left. ""Technical issues are just part and parcel of tech businesses,"" said Vlad Christoff, co-founder of Fasten. “We had braced for a 10x increase… we got 17x. Yes - we had a little bit of a hiccup!” Big boys back in town But by June, Uber and Lyft were back. There hadn’t been a compromise on security or data. Instead, state power in Texas overruled Austin’s local decision by creating statewide rules on ride-sharing that did not insist on fingerprint checks. Within a week, one Austin app, Fare, had folded. RideAustin saw its bookings drop by 55% - and it hasn’t ever recovered. The local apps all maintain that they have plenty of drivers, who make more money on their apps per trip than Uber or Lyft. And though it's difficult to measure independently, the fares are the same or cheaper too. Which makes you wonder - why did users go back to Uber and Lyft? ""They are very good at leveraging their cash position to do lots of free rides and promotions to get their share back,"" Mr Tryba said. Fasten’s Mr Christoff thinks brand recognition beyond the city is the problem. “The part that we’ve lost is visitors. For one year people landed at Austin’s airport, and they found out the hard way that the default ride-sharing apps on their phone didn’t work. ""Once Uber and Lyft came back, business continued as usual. [But] the locals stayed with us.” Drivers too have turned more frequently to Uber and Lyft instead of the smaller apps. ""It boils down to the quantity of rides,"" says Mr Allen. ""When you’re getting 10 requests on Uber to every one request on RideAustin, you’ve got to go to where the rides are. Right now Uber is paying me the most money, but per ride RideAustin is the best."" London calling I think it's unlikely that Uber's troubles in London will reach such a breaking point that the company ends up being forced off the streets. The appeal process keeps it on the road for the foreseeable future, and when dealing with city officials, Uber’s new CEO Mr Khosrowshahi has hinted at an ever-so-slightly more understanding approach than the man he replaced, Travis Kalanick. If Uber does leave, there are already a number of apps already in play (not to mention black cabs) that would seek to pick up the extra business - and the orphaned drivers. Both RideAustin and Fasten said they would consider looking at London as a new market for them, but had no immediate plans. “There is life after Uber,” Mr Christoff said. For political consultant David Butts, who worked with Austin City Council on the issue, the entire dispute speaks to a bigger problem of billionaire-backed start-ups believing they are free to dictate the rules. To city officials in London, he says: ""Stand up to them.” ""Don’t cave in. They’re not as strong.

"The update lets games verify that they were legitimately purchased and are running on an approved Oculus device. It also breaks an unofficial patch called Revive that lets Oculus-only games run on rival devices. But Revive's creator found he could disable digital rights management (DRM) in Oculus titles completely to keep the patch working. That also stops software from verifying it has been legally purchased, paving the way for pirates to copy Oculus games. Technological blockades ""DRM as a means to prevent piracy is rather futile,"" said Ernesto Van der Sar, founder of news website TorrentFreak. ""If there's a demand to use a product or access a service, people will often find a way around DRM and other technological blockades. ""History has shown many examples of how it mostly inconveniences legitimate customers."" Facebook-owned Oculus has invested in exclusive software titles to encourage people to buy its virtual reality headset over competing devices. The Revive patch, created by Libre VR, translated some of the functions of Oculus games into the OpenVR language, which is compatible with HTC's Vive and other headsets. In December 2015, the company's founder Palmer Luckey said he did not mind if gamers did this. ""If customers buy a game from us, I don't care if they mod it to run on whatever they want,"" he wrote on online community Reddit. He added that his goal was ""not to profit by locking people to only our hardware"". The update to the Oculus operating system, released on Friday, introduced a new ""platform integrity check"" that let software identify whether an Oculus-approved headset was being used. Bypassing the DRM The developer of Libre VR responded with a new patch that bypassed DRM checks in some games completely. But that not only prevented software from checking whether it was being run on an Oculus headset, but also whether it had been legally purchased. ""This is my first success at bypassing the DRM, I really didn't want to go down that path,"" said the developer. He told online technology magazine Motherboard: ""By disabling the ownership check the game can no longer determine whether you legitimately own the game. ""I still do not support piracy - do not use this library for pirated copies."" Oculus has previously said people should not expect hacked games to work ""indefinitely"". ""Regular software updates to games, apps and our platform are likely to break hacked software,"" the company told technology news website Ars Technica in April. Many gaming companies including Sony and Microsoft protect their software with some form of DRM, but Ernesto told the BBC it was not a surprise the Oculus update had been cracked so quickly. ""Oculus should focus on providing a superior platform and the best games instead of focusing on piracy at this point,"" he said. ""It's impossible to defeat piracy completely, but lessons from the movie and music industry show that providing great legal options work better than anti-piracy measures.""",An anti-piracy update for the Oculus virtual reality platform has been cracked within a day of release.
"James Ejankowski, who's 24, defrauded Clydesdale and Yorkshire Banking Group of more than £99,000 in December 2016. He spent the money on a BMW, a Range Rover and tattoos for his face. He lied to his family that he had won the money on a scratchcard, according to the prosecutor. Ejankowski, formerly of Guisborough but now of Clarence Road, Bridlington, discovered that if he used the Clydesdale Bank's online banking software to transfer notional funds between his current account and his savings account between midnight and 01:00, the transaction would work and the bank would not find out. ""For one hour there was a credit balance in his account even though he did not have any money,"" Prosecutor Shaun Dryden told Teesside Crown Court on Monday, according to the Teesside Evening Gazette. He used his partner Charlotte Slater's Natwest account to funnel £53,399. In addition to making purchases for himself, Ejankowski, who is unemployed, also used the money to pay off debts and to give two thousand pounds to his aunt and £1,362 to his father-in-law. Four weeks after he began stealing the funds, he turned himself in to the police on Boxing Day and made a full admission of guilt, saying he only had £40 left. Clydesdale Bank has so far been able to recover £34,000. Ejankowski has been sentenced to 16 months' imprisonment for fraud. Slater received a suspended sentence over her supporting role in the crime. Ejankowski was previously convicted in May 2015 for seven offences of fraud over selling items on the internet. He received a community service punishment of 200 hours of unpaid work, which was later replaced by a curfew. A Clydesdale Bank spokesperson told the BBC News website: ""This was a one-off isolated incident. We take fraud very seriously and note the court's decision.""","A UK hacker has been jailed for stealing almost £100,000 from a bank by exploiting a bug in the bank's online banking system."
"The country's data chief called it ""one of the biggest known data protection violations in history"". But the regulator admitted the amount was ""totally inadequate"" as a deterrent to the company. The search giant said it unintentionally collected data including emails, passwords and photos. Google has said it never intended to store the personal data, which had been captured in 2008-10, while the company gathered material for its Street View service. The information has since been deleted, the data protection agency said. 'Not authorised' Under European regulations, the maximum fine for an accidental violation is 150,000 euros - but data protection supervisor Johannes Caspar called for that amount to be increased in future. In a statement, the regulators said: ""Among the information gathered in the drive-bys were significant amounts of personal data of varying quality. For example, emails, passwords, photos and chat protocols were collected."" Google's executive chairman Eric Schmidt told the BBC that the violation came from ""the actions of a single individual that were not authorised by the executives"". ""Google of course is not perfect. In that particular case we actually disclosed it immediately and there were in fact no privacy violations. ""But it shows how seriously we take privacy and how important privacy is to everybody.""","Google has been fined 145,000 euros (£125,000) by German data regulators for illegally recording information from unsecured wi-fi networks."
"A court in The Hague has found XS Networks guilty of facilitating copyright infringement by refusing to shut down a site it knew to be illegal. The firm, which has ceased operations, used to rent its computer servers to the SumoTorrent website. The ruling could create a ""dangerous precedent"", said the TorrentFreak blog. SumoTorrent is unlikely to be affected because it moved its data to Ukraine before the case came to court, and continues to operate. But Brein, which is the Dutch acronym for Protection Rights Entertainment Industry Netherlands, said it was still worth pursuing the case. ""We take down more than 600 sites a year - these are sites which give access to illegal content,"" Tim Kuik, the head of Brein, told the BBC. ""If the sites are unco-operative, we go to the hosting provider that has to take them down according to a Dutch law, which states that if a site [falls into the category of] 'evidently illegal sites', the hosting provider has to take it offline. ""What is new now is that the court has ruled that a hosting provider that doesn't act promptly becomes liable for damages."" Mr Kuik said that the case could serve as an example to other countries in the European Union and elsewhere. ""The most important issue was to get this principle established, to show that there are consequences for hosting providers. ""It is important throughout the EU, because even though this case is about law in the Netherlands, this law has direct implementation of the EU directive on these issues."" 'Grey areas' But file-sharing news site TorrentFreak warned that it was not always very clear whether a site had copyright-infringing content. ""The ruling is quite far-reaching because I don't think companies are supposed to make decisions about copyright,"" said TorrentFreak's editor Ernesto van der Sar. ""In this case it might have been clear, but there are a lot of grey areas where it's not so clear."" For example, he said, if someone uploaded a copyrighted video to a site such as YouTube, it should not be up to the hosting company to decide whether or not this video should be removed; it should be up to the court. And even if the damages were not very high, he added, ""web hosts won't be able to fight it now because if they lose a battle they will have to pay damages"". ""It's probably not that big but it's not something you want your company to be involved in."" Before it closed in February, XS Networks put out a statement on its website, protesting its innocence. ""As you may know, the Dutch anti-piracy organisation Brein has sued us for alleged copyright intrusions of one of our clients,"" said the statement, which TorrentFreak provided to the BBC. ""We regret that they have chosen to make a spectacle of our last month in business. ""In our opinion there is nothing illegal about the websites that were hosted with XS Networks and are thankful for the warm messages from other webhosters and appreciation of our clients.""","An anti-piracy group in the Netherlands, Brein, has won a landmark case, making a file-sharing site's former web host liable for damages."
"The scheme revolves around a website that connects victims and police, gives advice and helps with data recovery. The number of ransomware victims tripled in the first three months of 2016, according to one estimate. Ransomware is malware that typically demands a fee to unscramble important data on a compromised device. The No More Ransom site will be updated as ransomware gangs are tackled, one of the project's partners said. Co-ordinated by Europol, the initiative also involves the Dutch national police, Intel Security and Kaspersky Labs. ""For a few years now ransomware has become a dominant concern for EU law enforcement,"" said Wil van Gemert, Europol's deputy director of operations. ""We expect to help many people to recover control over their files, while raising awareness and educating the population on how to maintain their devices clean from malware."" More victims No More Ransom brings together information about what ransomware is, how to avoid falling victim and what to do if a person or company is caught out. ""Right now the only option victims have is to pay the ransom or not,"" said Raj Samani, European head of Intel Security. ""This gives people another option."" Often, people struggle to find out what they can do when they are hit. With this website, victims will be able to upload scrambled files to identify which strain of ransomware has locked up their data, he said. ""We've seen a threefold increase in infected victims from January to March this year,"" he added. ""And we're seeing a rise in new families of ransomware coming up all the time."" In June, one site that tracks ransomware logged more than 120 separate families of the malicious code being used in different campaigns. ""It's becoming a hugely profitable economy for the criminals,"" said Mr Samani. ""They know there's real money to be made here. ""What's particularly telling is that historically ransomware victims have been consumers and small businesses,"" he said. ""But we are now seeing bigger institutions, hospitals and universities, getting hit."" The site will be kept up to date with information gleaned from international action against gangs that run ransomware campaigns, Mr Samani said. Other police forces, security companies and researchers will be encouraged to contribute to the site and add advice or tools to help victims. At present, the site links to decryption software for four well-known families of ransomware - Coinvault, Shade, Rannoh and Rakhni.","European police agency Europol is teaming up with cybersecurity companies in an initiative aimed at slowing an ""exponential"" rise in ransomware."
"In a letter published on the Wiki Weapon website, Stratasys said that it did not allow its printers ""to be used for illegal purposes"". Defense Distributed, the group behind the project, had planned to share 3D weapon blueprints online. Currently it is legal in the US to manufacture a gun at home without a licence. Defense Distributed raised $20,000 (£12,400) online to get the Wiki Weapon project started. It planned to develop a fully printable 3D gun, initially with no moving parts. ""This project could very well change the way we think about gun control and consumption,"" it said on its site. ""How do governments behave if they must one day operate on the assumption that any and every citizen has near instant access to a firearm through the internet?"" But the project hit a snag when the firm supplying the 3D printer got wind of what they were planning. In a letter to Defense Distributed founder Cody Wilson, Stratasys said that it had taken the decision to withdraw the printer ""based on your lack of a [firearms] licence and your public statements regarding your intentions in using our printer"". ""It is the policy of Stratasys not to knowingly allow its printers to be used for illegal purposes. Therefore please be advised that your lease of the Stratasys uPrint SE is cancelled at this time."" The firm collected the machine several days later. Printing trainers Government laws on the manufacture of guns will need quick revision to catch up with the age of 3D printing, thinks Marc Goodman, head of the Future Crimes Institute. ""This appears to be a grey area under US law and the laws of other countries. The question is: how do you control technology that can do illegal things?"" he said. ""In this case, this was being done very overtly and trying to prove a point. I am far more concerned about the people who aren't publicising it."" Mr Goodman predicts that 3D printing could be the next battleground in the fight against organised crime and terrorism. And it won't just be weapons that will be printed online. ""It will be the next frontier in IP [Intellectual Property] theft when you are able to manufacture a Rolex watch, Gucci handbags, Nike sneakers,"" he said.",A US project to create a printable gun has been derailed after the company supplying the 3D printer withdrew it.
"By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter The government had failed to properly fund plans to push ultra-fast broadband to the hardest-to-reach areas, it said. But the government said: ""We do not agree with this report, which contains a number of inaccuracies."" The findings come as another UK lockdown means people are reliant on broadband to work and learn from home. People in rural areas might have less choice of service providers, ""may have to pay more and may reach [1Gbps] broadband late"", according to the Public Accounts Committee. It said the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) had failed to make meaningful progress: And it had failed to show it had learned lessons from its superfast rollout programme or retain the people, skills and knowledge critical to its success. Other issues the PAC highlighted included failures to: Meg Hillier, who chairs the PAC, said: ""With the grim announcement that the country and economy will be locked down for months, the government's premises on digital connectivity are more important than ever. ""But due to a litany of planning and implementation failures at DCMS, those promises are slipping farther and farther out of reach, even worse news for the rural excluded who face years trying to recover with sub-standard internet connectivity."" The DCMS said the rollout of 1Gbps-capable broadband had been stepped up ""from one in 10 households in 2019 to one in three households today"". ""We expect that half of all households will have access to [1Gbps] speeds by the end of this year,"" it said. ""And the UK is deploying at a faster build rate than comparable countries. ""This is evidence of the progress we have made to support the private sector and reduce barriers to rollout. ""We will take further rapid steps this year alongside the investment being made as part of our record £5bn UK Gigabit Programme, which will focus on ensuring the hardest to reach 20% of the country is not left behind."" Commercial rollouts are expected to provide only 80% of homes and business with access to ultra-fast broadband, with the cost of providing fibre and cable services to rural areas proving too expensive without government subsidies. According to Ofcom, there are almost 600,000 homes and businesses without access to a broadband connection higher than 10Mbps. Revised down Offering all homes and businesses in the UK 1Gbps broadband speeds by 2025 was one of the key Conservative manifesto pledges in the run-up to the December 2019 general election. But the PAC said by November 2020, when it had taken evidence from the DCMS, it had become clear this was unachievable. The government has since revised its target down to ""at least 85%"" coverage. The original budget of £5bn was also revised down to £1.2bn over the next four years, leaving experts and concerned parties scratching their heads over how and when the remaining £3.8bn would be allocated.","Rural homes and businesses could be ""locked out"" of 1Gbps broadband for years, an inquiry by an influential committee of MPs has concluded."
"By Mark WardTechnology correspondent, BBC News Moore's Law states that the number of transistors that can be placed on a chip for the same cost will double roughly every two years. Generally, that doubling has been achieved by shrinking transistors - the basic processing units of a silicon chip. But everyone knows that, at some point, Moore's Law will halt because transistors can get no smaller. Around the world, professors, PhD candidates and grad students are looking to nanotechnology to go far beyond the tiny dimensions in current chips. But ""heroic"" techniques that work in the laboratory will not scale up to the numbers demanded by industrial chip production, according to Prof Mike Kelly from Cambridge University's Centre for Advanced Photonics and Electronics. ""They can do it in the labs and get one off results,"" he said, ""but there's another whole side to this as well."" The problem emerges, he said, because tiny components are made up of such a small number of atoms. The number of atoms in a structure, such as a gate in a transistor, determine its electrical properties. Prof Kelly's work suggests that if only one or two atoms are missing it will have a disproportionately large effect on that component's reliability. For silicon chips, making that compromise is not an option. Typically, said Prof Kelly, chip makers strive for what is known as six sigma reliability - with a chip this means it returns the expected answer 99.99966% of the time. The latest chips from Intel will be built with components only 22 nanometres (nm) across. By comparison, a human hair is about 60,000 nm wide. Intel and other chip makes have plans to go to 14nm and then 11nm. ""The big question,"" said Prof Kelly ""is at what stage does one or two atoms make a difference?"" Engineering history has lessons for chip makers keen to keep Moore's Law on track, said Prof Kelly. Marine engineering hit a problem during World War II, he said, when established techniques for manufacturing propellers were pushed too far. Those techniques had largely involved simply finding ways to make propellers bigger and bigger. Eventually, the result was propellers that turned out to be far less efficient because the shafts to turn them sagged under their own weight. Prof Kelly's fear is that unless chip makers significantly change current top-down manufacturing techniques they could be headed for a similar crunch moment. Typically, making a chip involves creating a stencil of the circuit, etching it onto a silicon wafer and putting the components on it layer by layer. ""Beyond 14nm that is going to get very, very hard,"" said Prof Kelly. Mike Mayberry, director of components research at Intel, agreed with Prof Kelly that top down manufacturing techniques have a technical limit. ""We need to do something different,"" he said. ""We cannot keep driving down that road without turning the wheel."" Changing the way chips are made is the only option, according to Mr Mayberry. ""We are mixing top-down methods with bottom-up methods and we are going to be able to build things we could not do before,"" he said. One method Intel and others have adopted is the laying down of several one-atom thick layers of a material that helps make the individual components more reliable. Professor Sir Mark Welland, head of the Cambridge University Nanoscience Centre, said such techniques had their uses but did not remove all the uncertainty. ""In order to get a good structure they would have to seed the surface in some way in order to grow from the bottom up,"" he said. ""Then you have the same issue, how well can you lay down a pattern?"" What should be remembered, said Prof Welland, was that Moore's Law was an economic law and has more to do with what it is possible to do for the same cost. Until now, the desire to drive down price has led to transistors being made smaller and packed in ever more tightly. But there is nothing in Moore's Law, said Prof Welland, which says that was the only way to keep it going. Mr Mayberry at Intel said his company was investigating other ways, apart from shrinking components, to make processors more powerful and useful. Internal architectures could be changed to help more data flow at any one time, he said. Sensors and wireless transmitters could be more closely integrated onto the chip. ""There are going to be incremental advances in all parts of the architecture,"" he explained. ""It can be about making them more useful, consume less power or take up less space."" In the mean time, drawing up a road map to keep Moore's Law rolling on was tricky, said Mr Mayberry. ""We look down the road and it's foggy. The nearby stuff is clear and we can see that the big stuff is there but we cannot see the details. ""The horizon is about 10 years away.""","For more than 40 years, the processing power of the silicon chip has grown in line with a prediction made by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore in 1965."
"Dave LeeNorth America technology reporter ""Unless the election is extraordinarily close, it is unlikely that an attack will result in the wrong candidate getting elected,"" suggest Matt Bernhard and Professor J Alex Halderman, security experts from the University of Michigan. But they say the risk the election process could be disrupted by hackers should be taken extremely seriously. In the run-up to the big day, the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has been carrying out ""cyber hygiene"" tests on voting systems across the country. Officials are confident in the technology, but there are weaknesses that have security professionals standing by on election day ready to step in if irregularities are spotted. The task facing any hacker isn’t insignificant. In the US, voting is done via electronic booths, the vast majority of which are not connected to the internet. Furthermore, different states, and areas within those states, use different systems - a logistical headache but something of a security godsend, as a fractured system is much harder to attack en masse. But any would-be election hacker wouldn’t need to target the whole country, or even an entire state. Instead, finding methods to implant minute differences, in areas which promise to be a close-run battle, could both affect the national picture and be difficult to detect. And so just as candidates target swing states that could go either way, so too could hackers be looking at ""hack states"" to target. Hard copy ""Two out of the last four presidential elections were so close that a change of a few counties in one state would have changed the result of the national presidential election,"" said Andrew Appel, professor of computer science at Princeton University, in an interview with BBC News. ""It’s not necessary to cheat in 9,000 different jurisdictions. If the election is close in just one state, changing several tens of thousands of votes might be enough."" Prof Appel is part of a team of cybersecurity experts that will be working together on Tuesday to advise election officials on cybersecurity-related matters - helping to identify genuine attacks from, say, just your bog-standard computer glitch, of which there may be plenty. ""There may be questions about some piece of machinery that is showing some symptom,"" he explained. ""Does that look like a hack or is that normal? That kind of question."" Any security audit, whether it’s to protect a company or a property, focuses on the points of weakness. And in this election, the points of weakness are the electronic voting booths. The greatest concern of the group, which is mostly a mixture of academics and security professionals, is that the security in place on voting machines in some crucial areas just isn't up to scratch. For starters, 10 states use touchscreen-only voting machines, an immediate concern. ""You touch the screen and indicate the candidate you want,” explained Prof Appel. ""There’s no paper involved, and at the end of the day it indicates how many votes the candidate got. There would be no way to tell if it was done fraudulently."" Who is ahead in the polls? Several security experts have demonstrated how this process can be tampered with, by installing malicious software capable of changing a switching a person's vote once it is in the machine, or by spoofing the smart cards used to identify a voter. Other states use what’s known as optical scan voting. That’s when a voter fills in a little oval on a page to cast their ballot. It’s logged by the computer, to make counting much quicker, but also stored as a hard copy. If the computer says the vote goes a certain way and there’s suspicion of shenanigans, it can be crossed checked against the paper copy. Most at-risk So where are the “hack states”? Verified Voting is an organisation that tracks the use of voting machines, and their security, across the US. It’s a painstakingly put together dataset which gives you an idea of the complexity of the US voting system. By using this resource, and combining it with polling data, Mr Bernhard and Prof Halderman were able to isolate key states with both poor voting booth security and a tight race. They named the states most at risk as Nevada, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Colorado. ""As jurisdictions with close races are most vulnerable to having their results perturbed or cast into doubt, these are the ones to be concerned about,” the researchers wrote. What else could go wrong? Most experts are in agreement that the voting machines provide the biggest risk - the key under the mat for anyone looking for a way in. But hackers may look to other means to agitate the process. ""A well resourced adversary, for instance a foreign government, could do plenty of other things to disrupt the election,” wrote Mr Bernhard and Prof Halderman. ""Cutting the power to a few key precincts could throw the entire election into chaos."" Furthermore, Prof Appel pointed to previous incidents in which voter registration databases were breached. In September, the FBI urged districts to work with the DHS to ensure their database systems were secure. ""The thing that could go wrong is that a voter could show up at the polling place and be told they’re not listed when in fact they should be listed,” Prof Appel explained. In concluding their data analysis on the at-risk states, Mr Bernhard and Prof Halderman offered a summary. “The 2016 election is less secure than it should be. ""While we think it’s unlikely that hackers will be able to silently change who wins, attacks that attempt to disrupt or discredit the electoral process in critical states are a distinct possibility.""

"The owl-shaped camera automatically focuses on the person speaking but also captures a panoramic view of everyone in the room. Staff said the technology lets them run group therapy sessions and treat former opioid addicts. It also helps them reach patients who live far away from treatment centres in the sparsely populated state. ""Video conferencing saves provider time and knowledge in a state that's underserved in... mental health and education-related services,"" said Ashley Six-Workman, a senior registered nurse who helps to run the West Virginia telepsychiatry project. Many of the patients receiving treatment would not otherwise get help, she said, since they did not have the money to travel long-distance regularly or did not feel happy making such a trip. ""Video allows the patients to stay in their county, the place where they feel comfortable and confident,"" she said. The telepsychiatry project runs 32 clinics across 23 of West Virginia's 55 counties. In an average week, it dispenses more than 140 hours of help. Group help The project has been running for several years but has recently trialled a number of different video systems in a bid to make counselling sessions more effective. Staff said some of the earlier video-calling technology had often got in the way of meaningful interaction. Prof Kari Law, a psychiatrist at West Virginia university, who also helps to run the counselling scheme, said the group had gone through about eight different camera, speaker and microphone combinations to find what worked best. ""That often led to mass confusion for staff in other offices because they are not so savvy on the technology side,"" said Dr Law. Ms Six-Workman said she often left clinics ""frustrated by the technology"". ""I could only imagine how the patients felt,"" she said. The telepsychiatry project has now partnered with start-up Owl Labs to use its video-conferencing system. Staff said the new technology had helped improve interaction when, in some cases, six or seven people had group therapy. ""With opioid treatments the group-based model works better because they can all hold each other accountable and are placed in different groups depending on where they are in the programme,"" said Ms Six-Workman. Dr Law said the project had proved so successful that the group had now applied for a federal grant so it could be expanded to another three US states.","Mental health experts in West Virginia, US, are turning to a video-calling ""owl"" to run opioid treatment sessions."

"By James ClaytonNorth America technology reporter The trial began on Monday - and is one of the most important in Apple's history. Apple boss Tim Cook will be giving evidence, the first time he's given testimony at a trial. At stake is the future of the App Store and the amount it charges developers - a wildly lucrative money spinner for the company. The trial got off to a slightly chaotic start. The public hearing failed at first to mute those who were listening in via phone call, meaning calls from fans for the return of Fortnite to mobiles were accidentally broadcast. The storm began in August last year, when Epic Games laid a trap for Apple. Its hit game Fortnite implemented its own in-app payment - bypassing Apple's 30% charges. Apple promptly kicked Epic Games off the App Store. But Epic Games was waiting for just that. It slapped Apple with a 65-page lawsuit - and had even prepared a high production video, a spoof of Apple's iconic 1984 advert for the Apple Mac. Epic Games has for years claimed the charges imposed on it by Apple are extortionate. Their argument is simple: that Apple's control over the App Store is anti-competitive. It believes that developers should be able to make apps for smartphones without having to pay large sums to Apple (and to Google for Google Play purchases). Spotify, Match and Tile are just a few of the many companies that have also claimed Apple's charges are unfair. Apple is estimated to have made hundreds of millions of dollars from Fortnite alone in charges. Epic Games' big argument is: if they don't want to pay, then where else do they go to sell their products? Apple's App Store and Google's Google Play are the dominant global app stores, outside China. Epic Games has tried to sell Fortnite away from these two stores. It tried to ""sideload"" the app on Android phones - to try and avoid Google's own 30% charge. However, not enough people downloaded it away from Google Play. Epic Games' reluctant conclusion: if you want to make games for smartphones you have to be on either the App Store or Google Play. 'Apple Tax' But unwilling to lie down and accept the charges - which it calls an ""Apple Tax"" - Epic Games decided to sue Apple instead. Worryingly for Apple, many of its App Store critics come from across the political divide. In a Senate hearing two weeks ago, Apple's Chief Compliance Officer Kyle Andeer was grilled by lawmakers. Politicians of all stripes - usually so divided on policy - were united in their attacks on Apple. Democrats Amy Klobuchar and Richard Blumenthal and Republicans Mike Lee and Josh Hawley all took up similar lines of questioning. Senator Klobuchar said that Apple's App Store was a ""literal monopoly"". And on Friday the European Union announced that it was charging Apple for its behaviour on the App Store. Epic Games has timed the lawsuit perfectly. The key question the judge will have to answer is whether Apple's App Store is an ""essential facility"", a sort of public utility that no one company should control. Matt Stoller, an anti-monopoly campaigner, believes so. ""Everybody knows that Apple is in charge of what should be public rights of way. It would be easiest if the judge just rules in favour of Epic [Games], that would fix it,"" he says. Apple can afford good lawyers though. So what's Apple's defence? Firstly, Apple says it invented the App Store and as a private company it can charge what it wants. It also says the 30% charge to developers is the industry standard for gaming, and competes not just with Google Play but with Microsoft, Steam, PlayStation, Xbox and Nintendo. 'Hand wavy' Influential tech blogger John Gruber says Apple has a point. ""In terms of the actual split, 70/30 is pretty standard across the board. One of the things that really stands out about Epic Games' argument is that they have no complaint whatsoever. It's all very hand wavy, and very much a PR argument, not a legal one."" Apple also says that its payment system is fair to smaller developers. It says 83% of apps and 76% of games on the App Store are free - developers pay no commission. And they say that although their top rate charge is 30%, most developers pay no more than 15% in charges. Apple argues it also oversees an App Store vetting process, making sure the Apple ecosystem isn't compromised by dodgy apps. That costs money. However it's thought the amount that Apple spends on this process is a tiny fraction of the amount it receives from developers. Critics like Matt Stoller also question how effective Apple's vetting procedures are. ""There are all sorts of apps that have scams that Apple doesn't catch. So their arguments about safety and security are sort of nonsense,"" he says. 'The risk is high' So what are Apple's chances? John Gruber thinks they're good. ""I do think that on legal grounds, Apple is in a very good position. But the risk is very high because [if they lost] it would disrupt the whole business model of the app store"". Matt Stoller says that antitrust cases are notoriously hard to predict. ""Antitrust law, as it's practiced in the US, is a complete mess. So we have no idea. The law basically depends on what the judge had for breakfast."" The trial is expected to conclude in the last week of May. However, even if Apple wins, the fight over how Apple runs its App Store will rage on. James Clayton is the BBC's North America technology reporter based in San Francisco.

"By Joe TidyCyber-security reporter It is the largest prize pool in the history of e-sports, with $30m shared amongst the winners. Kyle Giersdorf, 16, won the solo event of the competition in the Arthur Ashe Stadium in New York, which hosts the US Open tennis tournament. Jaden Ashman - a 15-year-old from Hornchurch, London - won almost £1m for coming second in the duos event. And another British teenager - 14-year-old Kyle ""Mongraal"" Jackson from Sidcup, Kent - also walked away with a major prize. Mr Giersdorf, known online as Bugha, stood laughing and shaking his head as the crowd erupted when his name was announced. He told the BBC he wants to save most of his prize. ""All I want is a new desk and maybe a desk for my trophy,"" he said. The final game was described by the commentators as a ""ridiculous victory lap"" as the winner played with a smile on his face whilst beating his rivals. The event is seen as a major moment in e-sports, which is estimated to be a billion-dollar industry in 2019. However, its record for the biggest prize pool is already set to be broken by another event called The International, taking place in August. The Fortnite finals saw 100 players battling on giant computer screens. Forty million players attempted to qualify over 10 weeks of online competition. More than 30 nations were represented with 70 players coming from the US, 14 from France and 11 from the UK. The game involves 100 players being dropped onto an island where they have to find weapons, build structures and eliminate each other until one player comes out on top. It has 200 million registered players worldwide and is free to download, but players can spend money on in-game purchases. Players can play alone, as part of a four-person squad or a 20-member team, either with friends or people they do not know. Last month its makers were quizzed by MPs on whether game developers Epic Games did enough to verify the age of players or encourage users to take breaks after long periods of gameplay. In April, the Duke of Sussex called for Fortnite to be banned, saying the game had been ""created to addict"". The firm's legal counsel Canon Pence told MPs that Epic Games staff had been ""quite taken aback"" by Prince Harry's comment.",A US teenager has won a record-breaking $3m (£2.4m) to become world champion of the computer game Fortnite.
"The firm suggested its size made it ideal for watching videos or running two apps alongside each other. Samsung helped popularise the so-called ""phablet"" category - in which phones approach tablet dimensions - with its original 5.3in Galaxy Note in 2011. That proved more popular than many expected, but one analyst suggested the latest device might be a step too far. The Android-powered handset's screen offers 234 pixels per inch (ppi) which allows it to support 720p resolution video playback. It means another South Korean firm, Pantech, can still lay claim to offering the biggest ""full HD"" 1080p smartphone with its 5.9in Vega No 6 which was announced in January. China's Huawei had previously boasted having the biggest largest-screened 720p smartphone with its 6.1in Ascend Mate. Samsung also makes the Galaxy Note 8.0. Some versions of this 8in-screened device feature an HSPA+ radio allowing them to make calls, but the machine is being promoted as a tablet with phone functionality rather than the other way round. 'Too cumbersome' Samsung suggested that, despite its dimensions, the Galaxy Mega was still small and light enough - at 199g (0.44lb) - to fit into users' pockets and be used with one hand. However, the firm is hedging its bets by offering a smaller 5.8in-screened version as an alternative. Both will go on sale in May, with Europe and Russia the first regions to be offered the devices. Tech consultancy Davies Murphy Group said that within the Android market there had been a notable shift towards people wanting to buy a single device rather than both a smartphone and tablet. However, its principal technology analyst, Chris Green, suggested that at 6.3in it would be a ""folly"" for most users to swap their current handsets for the larger of the two Galaxy Megas. ""There is genuine demand for larger smartphones - the problem is at what point does a smartphone turn into a tablet,"" he told the BBC. ""When you've got this up against your head you'd have to argue you're using a tablet and not a smartphone - it's definitely going to compromise its functionality because it's simply too big and too cumbersome to use as a traditional telephone device. ""But ignoring the phone functionality, as far as the rest of the smart device goes it looks quite phenomenal."" Samsung was the most popular smartphone maker in 2012 accounting for 30.3% of all shipments, according to analysts at IDC. Its rival Apple - whose largest handset has a 4in screen - came in second with a 19.1% market share.","Samsung has unveiled the biggest smartphone to date - the Galaxy Mega, which features a 6.3in (16cm) screen."
"The US lawsuit alleged the firms agreed not to poach staff from each other. It claimed the alleged agreement prevented workers from getting better job offers elsewhere. The 2011 US case had claimed $3bn in damages on behalf of more than 64,000 workers at the four firms. The latest attempt to settle the case for $415m, which was filed in court on Thursday, comes after a US judge rejected a $324.5m settlement offer last year. Executive emails The judge had deemed that settlement offer too low. If the companies had lost the case and damages were awarded, they could have tripled to some $9bn under US antitrust laws. The lawsuit, which was based largely on emails between some executives of the tech firms, has been watched with much interest for details about the alleged pact. According to some reports, one email exchange cited in the lawsuit shows Eric Schmidt, former chief executive of Google, telling Steve Jobs the former boss of Apple, that a Google recruiter who solicited an Apple employee would be fired.","Four of the world's biggest tech giants - Apple, Google, Intel and Adobe - have agreed to a new settlement of $415m (£273.5m) in an attempt to resolve a lawsuit."
