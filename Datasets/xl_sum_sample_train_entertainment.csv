"By Helen BushbyBBC Entertainment and Arts reporter Director Sir Nicholas Hytner praised the figures but added that cuts to funding were ""neglecting the arts"". One Man, Two Guvnors, starring James Corden, was the most successful National Theatre Live play to date, seen by 54,000 people in cinemas. War Horse is still selling out and has been seen by 2.4m people worldwide. Sir Nicholas described recent government arts cuts as ""a kind of madness, a kind of mania"" given the ""amount of joy spread by the Cultural Olympiad"" and London Festival 2012 - a series of national arts events which ran alongside the Olympics. ""You would hope government policy would be to find ways of capitalising on that for the arts and sport,"" he said at the launch of the theatre's annual report in London. ""There is visible evidence that investment in cultural and sport events brings in its wake confidence and the desire to spend - that case has been made in a spectacular fashion this summer."" He added that it was ""impossible to say the minuscule savings made by arts cuts are worth it"" . Regional theatres face a ""clear and present danger"" from funding cuts, he said. He was also keen to stress that this year's financial figures dated only to 31 March and did not cover the period during the Olympics. He said ""this summer was kind of spectacular"" and that the National Theatre had played to ""100% audiences right through the Olympics"". The ""only dip"" in box office during the Games was for One Man, Two Guvnors at London's Haymarket Theatre Royal in the first week of the Olympics and figures had gone up again immediately afterwards. The director said he had been ""disconcerted"" by ""people saying it would be doom or disaster"" for London theatres during the Olympics"" and that it had been a ""really great"" year. The theatre's successes also include a stage adaptation of Mark Haddon's book The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, which is currently playing to positive reviews. Hytner said it could had ""potential for longer life"". But he said current box office success only meant the theatre would be ""OK short-term"" and that it would be ""a bad idea to have it that long-term we should earn what we're currently earning from commercial transfers"". One Man, Two Guvnors is currently playing in Broadway and its lead actor, James Corden, won a best actor Tony award in June. War Horse has won five Tony awards and is also running in Toronto, Canada and is on a north American tour. New productions will open in Australia and Berlin in the coming year, while in autumn 2013 it will go on a 10-month tour to eight UK cities and Dublin. It was also made into a film by Steven Spielberg. Sir Nicholas said: ""It is essential that our funding level is restored to what it was before the cuts."" The Department for Culture, Media and Sport told the BBC: ""Protecting arts funding while cutting public spending in other areas is simply not an option, although the reductions we have made are very modest. ""Over the life of this Parliament, the government is investing £2.3bn in the arts. We have also reformed the National Lottery, increasing the share to the arts, so the Arts Council's overall budget in 2015 will be reduced by less than 5% in real terms, compared to 2010."" It added that the London 2012 Festival was ""fully supported by government and backed by a significant amount of public funding"". The theatre's report also stated that the development department raised £7.4m in annual income, its highest totals from individuals and corporate support. And it added 4,000 young people from 300 schools and youth theatres took part in NT Learning's nationwide youth programme, Connections.","The National Theatre has reported record yearly takings of £80m, more than double those of 10 years ago and nearly £10m more than last year."
"Damien Chazelle's movie is up for best musical or comedy film, while there are acting nominations for its stars Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. Chazelle is up for best film director and it is also nominated for original screenplay, score and song. Coming-of-age drama Moonlight is close behind with six nominations, including best drama film. British actress Naomie Harris is up for best supporting actress for her role as a drug addict in the film. Manchester by the Sea, about a caretaker who finds himself taking in his teenage nephew, has five nods - best drama film, original screenplay, director for Kenneth Lonergan, actor for Casey Affleck and supporting actress for Michelle Williams. The other best drama actor nominees are Joel Edgerton for Loving, Andrew Garfield for Hacksaw Ridge, Viggo Mortensen for Captain Fantastic and Denzel Washington for Fences. Natalie Portman is favourite for the best drama actress award for playing Jacqueline Kennedy in the biopic Jackie. She will face competition from Arrival's Amy Adams, Jessica Chastain for Miss Sloane, Isabelle Huppert for Elle and Ruth Negga for Loving. World War II biopic Hacksaw Ridge, Texan family drama Hell or High Water and Indian/Australian coming-of-age movie Lion are also up for best drama film. BBC series The Night Manager has fared well in the TV categories, with nods for its British stars Olivia Colman, Tom Hiddleston and Hugh Laurie. It is also up for best limited series. Analysis - Lizo Mzimba, BBC entertainment correspondent The Golden Globe nominations contained few real surprises and in many ways have confirmed, rather than changed the direction of this year's film awards race, which will culminate with the Oscars in February. Since it opened the Venice Film Festival in August, La La Land has been seen as the frontrunner for best film and best director at the Academy Awards, with its main rivals remaining Moonlight and Manchester by the Sea. Although the Golden Globes offers twice as many lead acting categories as the Baftas or the Oscars, today has done little to change the perception that Casey Affleck (Manchester by the Sea) and Emma Stone (La La Land) remain the favourites for the best actor and best actress Academy Awards. Perhaps most notable is the performance of Moonlight, with just one nomination fewer than La La Land. The Miami-set story of a young black man dealing with his sexuality now looks like the leading film to help end the race controversy of the last two years, with Mahershala Ali heavily tipped to win best supporting actor. And while Fences performed less strongly overall, Viola Davis is also thought likely to win best supporting actress. A welcome sign that after two years of #OscarsSoWhite, next year's Academy Awards nominations are likely to be more diverse - and on top of that the favourites to win in two of the acting categories are black. Olivia Colman faces fellow Brit Thandie Newton (Westworld) for best supporting actress in a limited TV series, as well as Game of Thrones star Lena Heady plus Chrissy Metz and Mandy Moore, who are both recognised for family comedy drama This Is Us. The Night Of's British star Riz Ahmed is nominated alongside Hiddleston for best actor in a limited TV series. They are up against Bryan Cranston for All the Way, John Turturro for for The Night Of and Courtney B Vance for American Crime Story: OJ Simpson v The People. American Crime Story: OJ Simpson v The People is also recognised, with acting nominations for John Travolta, Sterling K Brown and Sarah Paulson alongside Vance. The drama is also up for best limited series. In the movie categories, Disney's Zootopia and Moana are among those up for best animated feature film, alongside Kubo and the Strings, My Life as A Zucchini and Sing. Florence Foster Jenkins, based on the true story of a New York heiress who dreams of being an opera star, has four nominations, including a 30th Golden Globe nod for Meryl Streep and one for Hugh Grant. It is also up for best comedy or musical film alongside La La Land, 20th Century Woman, Deadpool and Irish film Sing Street, which was written and directed by Once film-maker John Carney. Other actors recognised in the musical/comedy category include Colin Farrell (The Lobster), Jonah Hill (War Dogs) and Ryan Reynolds (Deadpool). Alongside La La Land's Stone and Streep in best actress in a musical or comedy film category are Lily Collins (Rules Don't Apply), Hailee Steinfeld (The Edge of Seventeen) and Annette Bening (20th Century Women). Sully, starring Tom Hanks, was a notable omission from the list, as was with Martin Scorsese's Silence.

"By Tim MastersArts and entertainment correspondent, BBC News The judges described it as ""a truly outstanding museum with a bold artistic vision"". The park, situated in the grounds of Bretton Hall in Wakefield, was first opened to the public in 1977. Picking up the £100,000 prize, founder Peter Murray said: ""We've tried so hard to develop something which is unique not just in this country but also in Europe and beyond. ""This award makes us feel we are moving in the right direction."" The park has held exhibitions for the likes of Eduardo Paolozzi, Lynne Chadwick and Ai Weiwei. Its collection of works by Henry Moore is one of the largest open-air displays of his bronzes in Europe. The museum of the year shortlist included the Hayward Gallery and the Tate Britain in London and the Ditchling Museum of Art in East Sussex. The winner was announced by theatre and film director Sam Mendes at the National Gallery in London on Wednesday night. Yorkshire Sculpture Park Yorkshire Sculpture Park opened in the grounds of Bretton Hall College near Wakefield in 1977. The 500 acres of parkland and gardens are home to sculptures by Henry Moore, Barbara Hepworth and Anthony Caro, while the venue also has several indoor galleries. It has won praise in recent years for major exhibitions by artists including Joan Miro, Jaume Plensa and Yinka Shonibare. Shonibare, who exhibited there last year, recently nominated it as his favourite exhibition space, saying it was ""one of the only spaces in the country where you can properly show things both indoors and outdoors"". In May, Chinese artist Ai Weiwei opened his first UK public exhibition in four years at the venue. His works are being shown in and around an 18th Century chapel, which has recently had a £500,000 refurbishment. It is home to Arts Council England's sculpture collection. Founder Peter Murray was awarded an OBE in 1996 and a CBE in 2010. Fans include Monty Python's Michael Palin and rapper Dizzee Rascal, who visited the venue while on tour. In 2011, he named it as one of the places that inspired him the most, saying the sculptures were ""like nothing I'd ever seen before"", adding: ""The contrast between the natural surroundings and contemporary structures is stunning."" ""A perfect fusion of art and landscape, the Yorkshire Sculpture Park has gone from modest beginning to one of the finest outdoor museums one might ever imagine,"" said Art Fund director Stephen Deuchar, chair of the judges. ""In 2013 it really came of age - with art projects such as Yinka Shonibare's extraordinary exhibition; the fruits of the expansion and consolidation of the landscape on both sides of the lake; and with the conversion of the chapel to house (as its inaugural exhibition) a major new work by Ai Weiwei."" Skyfall director Mendes said: ""The dedication, love, and unbelievable creativity of the six candidates for the Art Fund prize for museum of the year are clear for all to see, as is the creative health of the UK museum community as a whole. ""Financial health is a different matter, however - and in that respect this award is a crucially important boost to one deserving organisation."" Murray, who still serves as Yorkshire Sculpture Park's executive director, told the BBC after his win: ""We started with £1,000 and no staff. I did sense that we were onto something in 1977 because the landscape is very special."" He added: ""We want to use the money to continue to support young artists and provide open access to the park."" The other shortlisted museums: Ditchling Museum of Art and Craft: Ditchling became a hub of creativity after sculptor Eric Gill moved there in 1907, followed by other artists and craftspeople. Two local sisters opened a museum in 1985 and a £2.3m revamp put it on the national map last year. Hayward Gallery: The judges said the Hayward had an ""exceptional year"" thanks to exhibitions like Light Show and Alternative Guide to the Universe at its South Bank home, plus touring exhibitions by Turner Prize winners Jeremy Deller and Mark Leckey. Mary Rose Museum: This £35m museum was built to house the remains of the Mary Rose, a warship launched by Henry VIII in 1511. The judges said the museum ""demonstrates excellence, innovation and imagination in the presentation of a truly unique artefact"". Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts: Part of the University of East Anglia, this venue expanded last year with new facilities designed by its original architect Norman Foster. It doubled its annual visitor numbers in 2013. Tate Britain: 116 years after it opened, the oldest parts of Tate Britain have undergone a £45m refurbishment, while its collection has had a major rehang to arrange the paintings in chronological order. There has, however, been criticism of its director Penelope Curtis.",The open-air Yorkshire Sculpture Park has been named the museum of the year.

"The target applies to all home-grown programmes on Sky 1, Sky Atlantic, Sky Living and Sky Arts. The broadcaster said it means 20% of ""significant roles"" will go to actors with an ethnic minority background. Sky said the target is in excess of the 14% of the British population from minority groups. ""Sky is dedicated to making programmes that feel representative of every one of the millions of viewers that watch our content every day, whatever their colour,"" said Sky's Director of Entertainment, Stuart Murphy. ""Our aim is to kick start a sea change in the on screen representation of ethnic minorities on British television."" 'New talent' The broadcaster also said all its original programmes will have someone with a black, Asian or minority ethnic (BAME) background in at least one senior production role. The aim, it said, is to provide ""more opportunities for people with BAME backgrounds to reach senior positions within the production community"". Sky added it ""will work closely with companies from the independent production sector to seek out and nurture new talent"". The move follows a BBC initiative in June that saw the corporation pledge to increase the number of BAME people on air by more than 40% over the next three years. The BBC also announced a ring fenced £2.1m development fund to help fast-track BAME talent and programme ideas on to the screen.","The broadcaster, Sky, has pledged that 20% of the writers and actors for its UK-commissioned TV shows will come from ethnic minorities by 2016."
"Will GompertzArts editor@WillGompertzBBCon Twitter The National Gallery in London has more than its fair share of good curators, not least Gabriele Finaldi, the institution's boss. He is a specialist in Renaissance and Baroque art with an international reputation, which must be an additional pressure if you happen to be a rank-and-file National Gallery curator putting on a show of Renaissance and Baroque art. When I put this to Letizia Treves, the curator of its newly opened Artemisia Gentileschi exhibition, she smiled graciously. We left it at that. No need to elaborate. Anyway, her show does the talking for her. It starts well. The first painting you see sets the tone for the rest of the exhibition. It is not only big, biblical and Baroque, but also has a subject matter that provides important autobiographical detail about Gentileschi, who painted Susannah and the Elders (1610) when she was a 17-year-old apprentice working in her father's studio in Rome. It depicts the Old Testament story of the virtuous Susannah - who is trying to have a private bath in a fountain - being harassed by two lecherous men. They tell her that if she refuses to succumb to their advances they will accuse her of adultery, a sin punishable by death. It's a remarkably accomplished picture for one so young, completed under the tutelage of her father, Orazio, who might also have had a hand in its creation. The modelling of the nude body, the colour-mixing used in the rendering of the garments, and the play of shadows are all techniques she learned from her father. But the emotion and palpable menace the painting transmits are pure Artemisia. For her, it was personal. The teenage artist was a young woman operating in a man's world. Unwanted and uninvited sexual advances were not unknown to her. She could relate to Susannah's ordeal. And more. Around the time she was working on this painting, her father began a collaboration with an artist called Agostino Tassi, who aggressively pursued Artemisia. She rebuffed him. He attacked her, she fought back. But he was too strong. Tassi stood trial for her rape in 1612, the transcript from which is shown in the exhibition. He was convicted, but not before the court had tortured Artemisia by crushing her fingers until she screamed. They wanted to be sure she was telling the truth. ""It is true! It is true! It is true!"" she exclaimed through the pain. It is a traumatic experience that has come to define Artemisia Gentileschi as an artist and a historical figure. Given what she produced next, you can see why. On the right-hand wall in the second room of the exhibition hang two huge paintings of the same Old Testament story, Judith Beheading Holofernes. Made by Gentileschi between 1612-14, they do not spare any of the gory details. Judith uses her left hand to get a decent grip on Holofernes's beard, while in her right is the sword with which she decapitates the Assyrian general. Blood gushes as the artist captures the most horrific moment in this most horrific act. It is a piece of revenge art, according to many commentators. And so it might be. But to limit it and the woman who created the picture to such a reductive reading is to underplay, and possibly miss altogether, her significance as a major figure in the history of art. First and foremost, Gentileschi was an exceptional artist, as these two paintings demonstrate. Her mastery of composition, colour and line are first class. The modelling of the three figures is highly sophisticated, as is her use of chiaroscuro (exaggerated contrast between light and shade). Added to this is the drama and atmosphere she conveys in pictures that present the female protagonist in a new light: independent, powerful and determined. Artemisia Gentileschi was a uniquely gifted artist who should be considered among the all-time greatest painters, regardless of her back story. True, she might well have pictured Tassi in her mind as the blade plunged into one of the many male characters in her shock-and-awe paintings. But that was not why she made them. They were commissions. Such scenes were all the rage in 17th Century Italy, where Baroque art - as defined by Caravaggio, with its dramatic lighting and narrative theatricality - lent itself to the spectacular. There is a cinematic quality to it that has influenced filmmakers from Orson Welles to Martin Scorsese. We like thrillers and horror movies. They liked thrillers and horror pictures. Orazio Gentileschi learned his methods from Caravaggio, who painted his version of Judith Beheading Holofernes in 1599. It is a technically better picture than the 20-year-old Artemisia's, but it doesn't have the same graphic intensity, and his Judith looks timid and a bit weedy. His is a pre-watershed picture. Hers is most definitely post-watershed. Not every painting she produced was a winner. There are 29 in the National Gallery show, a few of which are not top notch. But even when she makes a mistake, the outcome is compelling. In 1623 she started work on another Judith picture, this time skulking away in the aftermath of her murderous act in Judith and her Maidservant with the Head of Holofernes (1623-5). It has all the hallmarks of the Italian Baroque: a simple design, a limited number of figures who appear near the front of the picture plane, blocks of rich yellows, reds and blues - and, of course, the single light source creating a scene full of melodrama. The trouble is that the single light source in this instance - a candle near Judith's upper arm - is in the wrong place. It is too far behind Judith, who has her left hand held out catching the light that is clearly behind it, which is not possible. The mistake is compounded by a poorly painted shadow covering much of Judith's face, which is also not possible. It's a splodge and a botch. And yet. Who cares? The fabrics are beautifully painted, Judith's hand is wonderfully rendered, and the composition of the scene is a success. The exhibition ends in London, which is where Orazio had moved to work in the court of Charles I. It is here that we are told Artemisia produced one of her finest paintings. It is a self-portrait called the Allegory of Painting (1638-9). She had used herself as a subject on numerous occasions, but usually in the guise of someone else, as is the case with the National Gallery's recently acquired Self-Portrait as Saint Catherine of Alexandria (1615-17). There is no hiding behind another character in this grand finale, show-stopping self-portrait, in which we see her at work (made possibly with the use of a mirror) dressed in a splendid green silk dress with a lace trim. She looks younger than a woman in her mid 40s (her age when in London), which has led some to question whether she made this painting earlier. But it doesn't really matter. The painting matters. And it's wonderful. It is an extraordinary achievement by an extraordinary artist. It is a good way to end a good show by a good curator.

"Screenwriter Jenny Lumet has said he directed his driver to take her to his apartment after she'd said she wanted to go home, before they had sex. Simmons said her memory of that evening in 1991 was ""very different from mine"". But he apologised for being ""thoughtless and insensitive"" in some relationships over the years. In a statement, he said: ""While I have never been violent, I have been thoughtless and insensitive in some of my relationships over many decades and I sincerely and humbly apologise."" Feeling of 'dread' Lumet, who wrote Rachel Getting Married and The Mummy and is the daughter of film-maker Sidney Lumet, gave her account to The Hollywood Reporter.

"By Mark SavageBBC Music reporter School of Rock, based on the 2002 film, is about a group of schoolchildren who turn their lives around by entering a Battle of the Bands contest. The young cast - aged between nine and 12 - all play their own instruments. ""At this time when there are cuts to music in schools, these are the kids that prove music is vital,"" Lord Lloyd-Webber told the BBC. He said music ""is a force for the good and empowers young people"". 'Alienated from politics' The composer, whose own foundation funds arts education programmes in the UK, said the government should rethink its ""counter-productive"" cuts. ""At a time when people are feeling alienated from politics, the arts cut right through that,"" he said. Downton Abbey creator Julian Fellowes, who wrote the musical's book, picked up on the theme. ""One of the main purposes of the education years is to help children find out who they are and what they want to do, and the arts are one of the greatest means of allowing people to discover their identity,"" he said. ""It really is mad for the country to cut back on that and throw out a whole load of people from school who really haven't found out what they want to do."" Lord Lloyd-Webber and Lord Fellowes were speaking as they unveiled the cast for the West End transfer of School of Rock, which opened to enthusiastic reviews on Broadway last year, earning four Tony Award nominations. The show, based on the Jack Black film, features three rotating casts of child actors, selected after a nationwide search earlier this year. They range from experienced actors, drawn from the casts of Matilda and The Lion King, to complete newcomers. Among them is Amelia Poggenpoel, from Formby, who made headlines last year when her singing reduced Shia LaBeouf to tears. The 10-year-old approached LaBeouf at his #TouchMySoul exhibition in Liverpool and performed Who's Lovin' You by the Jackson Five. When she finished, the actor stood up and hugged her, sobbing: ""You touched my soul."" She will play Shonelle in the musical, her first West End role after several appearances in Liverpool. Amelia told the BBC she was living in a ""School of Rock house"" with other cast members, where tutors run lessons before and after rehearsals. The set up is ""much better"" than regular school, she added. Other cast members include Isabelle Methven and Eva Trodd, both 11, who previously played Little Cosette in the West End production of Les Miserables, and Natasha Raphael, 10, who toured the UK in the role of Annie last year. Toby Lee, an 11-year-old from Priors Marston who runs a successful YouTube channel showcasing his guitar skills, is one of three youngsters filling the role of Zack. 'Depth of talent' The show revolves around failed rock star Dewey Finn who, in need of cash to pay his rent, fakes his credentials as a substitute teacher. But what starts out as an excuse to get paid for slacking off turns into a life-affirming experience, as he prepares his pupils for a local battle of the bands. ""The reason I loved this story is every character in this story is somehow changed for the better through music,"" said Lord Lloyd-Webber, who first revealed he had bought the rights in 2013. For the first time since Jesus Christ Superstar in 1971, he chose to premiere his new show in the US, principally because it has more relaxed child labour laws - meaning the production could have one permanent cast. He previously expressed misgivings about bringing the show to London, saying he doubted whether he could find 39 children capable of pulling off the live musical elements of the show. Instead, he said, ""we could have found five bands to play"". ""The depth of musical talent that we auditioned is something that I have to admit I didn't think we would find. I kind of feared they'd all be into their computers, but this proves that they aren't."" The role of Dewey Finn will be played in London by David Fynn, currently starring in US sitcom Undateable. He said working with three rotating casts of children helped give the show spontaneity. ""It keeps me on my toes and, as a result, it helps them stay engaged.""

"In newly filed court documents as part of his $50m (£39m) defamation case against her, Depp accused Heard of having ""painted-on bruises"". ""I have denied Ms Heard's allegations vehemently since she first made them in May 2016,"" he said. A lawyer for Heard denied the allegations against his client. Depp launched the defamation case against Heard after the actress described herself as the victim of domestic abuse in a piece in the Washington Post in December. Heard asked a judge in Virginia to dismiss the lawsuit, prompting the new declaration from Depp. ""I have denied Ms Heard's allegations vehemently since she first made them in May 2016 when she walked into court to obtain a temporary restraining order with painted-on bruises that witnesses and surveillance footage show she did not possess each day of the preceding week. ""I will continue to deny them for the rest of my life."" Depp added: ""I never abused Ms Heard or any other woman. ""She was the perpetrator, and I was the victim. While mixing prescription amphetamines and non-prescription drugs with alcohol, Ms Heard committed innumerable acts of domestic violence against me, often in the presence of a third-party witness, which in some instances caused me serious bodily harm."" In a statement to People magazine, Heard's lawyer Eric George said: ""The evidence in this case is clear: Johnny Depp repeatedly beat Amber Heard. ""In light of the important work done by the #TimesUp movement highlighting the tactics abusers use to continue to traumatise survivors, neither the creative community nor the public will be gaslit by Mr Depp's baseless blame-the-victim conspiracy theories.""

Many ITV and BBC programmes will move on to BritBox after they have been broadcast on TV and fallen off the broadcasters' own catch-up services - BBC iPlayer and ITV Hub. The BBC is soon expected to get permission from regulator Ofcom to keep shows on iPlayer for a year as standard. As well as recent shows, it will also be the home of thousands of hours of classic British comedies, dramas and documentaries. Not all BBC and ITV programmes will automatically go on BritBox, though. Many are made by independent production companies, who own the rights and might instead sell them to a service like Netflix after their TV broadcasts, as has previously happened with hits like Peaky Blinders. Some BBC and ITV shows that are already on Netflix, such as Happy Valley, will move to Britbox - but, again, it will depend on who owns the rights. The BBC and Netflix will also carry on co-producing programmes together as a way of sharing costs, especially for big-budget dramas. But BBC director general Tony Hall said BritBox was ""the prime place in which we want our material to end up"". How does the price compare with other services? Haven't viewers paid for classic BBC programmes once? Asked why viewers should pay an extra charge to watch shows originally funded by the licence fee, Lord Hall compared BritBox with releasing a programme on DVD. ""That was the BBC saying, there's a secondary market - you pay for content after we've shown it,"" he said. ""This is just a modern-day version of that, and an even better version of that, because it used to be infuriating when you'd seen a programme on the BBC and you couldn't get hold of the DVD."" Any money the corporation makes will be put back in to programme-making, he said. ""I think this is wins all round for the licence fee payers."" The new shows to be made specifically for the new platform will be exclusive to BritBox, and the annual budget for original programming will be in the tens of millions of pounds. In comparison, Netflixreportedly spent $12bn (£9.5bn) on programmes last year. Why are the BBC and ITV doing this? Normally rivals, the two broadcasters want to get a foothold in a fiercely competitive commercial streaming world against the likes of Netflix, Amazon and NowTV, while Disney+ and AppleTV+ are launching soon. The BBC and ITV tried to launch something similar a decade ago, but were blocked by regulators. Now they are trying to catch up with their heavyweight competitors. Netflix has more than 150 million subscribers worldwide - but saw its share price plummet this week, after adding fewer viewers than expected in the last three months, with price rises blamed. The BBC and ITV launched BritBox in North America in 2017, showing programmes like Midsomer Murders, Poirot and Only Fools and Horses. It now has 650,000 subscribers, which ITV chief executive Dame Carolyn McCall said was ""exceeding its targets"". The bottom line is that BritBox is another way to attract eyeballs and to make money from the broadcasters' back catalogues. Dame Carolyn said the agreement to launch BritBox in the UK was ""a milestone moment"". She said: ""Subscription video on demand is increasingly popular with consumers who love being able to watch what they want, when they want to watch it. They are also happy to pay for this ease of access to quality content and so BritBox is tapping into this, and a new revenue stream for UK public service broadcasters."" ITV will own 90% of the new BritBox service and the BBC's initial 10% stake could rise to 25% in the future. Lord Hall insisted that this was not the first step toward changing the BBC from a licence fee-funded organisation to a subscription model. ""The fundamental funding for the future must be through the licence fee,"" he said. Will people want to sign up? Friday's press release said ""viewers will want to subscribe to BritBox because it is uniquely British"", and that there is ""growing consumer demand in the UK for streaming services"". Five million homes have more than one subscription TV service - a growth of 34% per year. Former BBC executive Ashley Highfield said he thought the monthly price was ""about right"", and that BritBox would end up with subscriber numbers in the ""low millions"". He told BBC News: ""I don't think they think it's something that's going to take over from Netflix. It's probably going to rub alongside."" TV critic Emma Bullimore said she thought asking viewers to pay for mainly old content would be ""quite tough"". She told the BBC: ""I think in the long term it's going to be a success. In the short term I think it's going to be a bit of a struggle."" She added: ""It is bad news for TV fans in that we're going to have to pay for loads of individual subscriptions. Now, most people have their TV, maybe they have Sky and Netflix - whereas if you have to pay for Netflix, Amazon, Disney, BritBox… it's going to get quite expensive."" Broadcasting analyst Tom Harrington from Enders Analysis said there is ""certainly a market for great British content"", but that BritBox might be a tough sell. ""You're going to get a lot of content that you've seen before, content that you think you might have paid for before, and content that's been free for possibly a year on iPlayer,"" he said. ""Why people sign up for services is usually for new, original content, and there will be a paucity of that on this service."" Its budget for original programming and technology will not rival those of the US streaming giants, he added. ""It's not going to be a Netflix killer. It won't take over Amazon in any way. What it will be is an almost niche service alongside those two, at best."" Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

"By Mark SavageBBC News entertainment reporter Exactly 12 months ago, the singer was introduced to millions at the Brits, where she picked up the Critics' Choice award for up-and-coming new artists. Her debut album, Our Version Of Events, went to number one the same week, and the Scottish singer has barely paused for breath since. She sang at the opening and closing ceremonies of the Olympics; married her long-term boyfriend in Montenegro; and rounded off the year with a headline concert at the Royal Albert Hall. The 25-year-old is also the front-runner at this year's Brit Awards, with a total of four nominations. Ahead of Wednesday's ceremony, she looks back at the highlights and lowlights of a ""surreal"" year in the limelight. Playing at the Olympics was the most nerve-wracking thing I've ever done. I'd never felt that nervous before anything - an exam, a show, anything. Singing Abide With Me was the worst, because I'd done so much research into how it was written, and what it meant to people. It was one of Ghandi's favourite songs, so I really felt a huge responsibility to deliver it correctly… and to remember the words! The reaction to the opening ceremony was a huge relief. When you're involved in something that big, you just don't know how people are going to respond. You could feel everyone was nervous about what the press was going to think, and how it would be perceived. So the reaction was wonderful. I was ecstatic the performance went well... and that I didn't fall over! I've watched it back once and it feels like, ""oh, is that me?"". It's such a surreal thing to see yourself perform in front of billions of people. I like making my fans cry. It sounds mean, but when people cry to your music, it feels good because you know it connected. Something about the lyric or the melody has really got in there. If anyone ever tells me they've cried at a show, then I'm quite moved and touched by that. I can't believe I got to play the Royal Albert Hall so early in my career. Two years ago I opened for Alicia Keys and I remember stepping out and thinking, ""Whoa, imagine if you could sell this place out yourself"", and I thought maybe in five or six years it would be possible. So that was a really great night, a real summary of how the year had gone. My whole family was there and my friends had come down from Scotland - but the party on stage was probably better than the after-party! After the adrenalin goes down, you just want to go home. But I remember really enjoying being on stage, and that's not something you can guarantee every night. Meeting your idols is a huge honour. I was in America recently for Clive Davis's pre-Grammy Party and I met Joni Mitchell. For me, that was a huge moment in my life because she'd been such an inspiration when I was a kid. To have her sitting there while I performed - she's a legend, I was really starstruck. I spoke to her afterwards and she was everything I hoped - very gentle, very intelligent. Just amazing. I wouldn't have dared go up to her without some kind of invitation - but luckily a producer I'd worked with knew her and said, 'Joni really wants to meet you'. So I was summoned and I went over. I wouldn't have had the guts to go over myself. Not every interview goes according to plan. I did an American interview and he opened it up by saying, ""So, you're an immigrant's daughter?"" I was like, ""Oh, my goodness"". The whole interview was like that. It was very strange but I didn't give him the reaction he wanted. The music industry moves very slowly. I was surprised at how long it takes from the moment you write a song to get it onto radio. It's quite frustrating. You get so excited by a song and you want everyone to hear it right away. But to do it right, you have to have a plan. Sometimes it is tempting to just put it online and say, ""here you go"". It would be great to put out some free music that's about what I'm thinking right now, instead of what I was thinking eight months ago. Free time is a distant memory. There's a lot of downtime that's not really downtime. Half an hour here, half an hour there. It makes it very difficult to write new music. You have bits and bobs but you can't get anything that's cohesive. I've got ideas and lots of voice memos, but I need to have some solid time set aside. So as soon as we've done this European tour, I'm going to spend a lot of time writing. When you become famous, you get a lot of free gifts. Oh God. There's so many lotions and potions that you get for free! My husband Adam gets really annoyed with it cluttering up the house, but I insist I absolutely need it. The biggest benefit of my job is the travel. I could travel before and I loved doing it. But when people know your music, you connect very quickly, because they open up to you and tell you so much about themselves. Getting to meet people in their country, as opposed to being a tourist, has been the most incredible thing. Straight after the Brits, I'm playing at Elton John's Oscar party. He's been such a big supporter ever since the album came out. It's amazing to go out there - and I'll probably be singing with him as well. I have no idea what song… If I had to choose, Rocket Man would be cool. I can't wait. I've lost count of the number of times I've had to pinch myself... ...But it's been a lot! It's the longest year I've ever had. Fully packed. Things I would have dreamt of doing in four years, I've crammed into one. It feels quite manic. But you want to go as fast as you can, I guess. Emeli Sande will perform at The Brits ceremony, which is broadcast on ITV at 20:00 on Wednesday, 20 February. Her new album, Live At The Royal Albert Hall, is out now.","""It's been quite a year,"" laughs Emeli Sande, with not a little dose of understatement."
"The Men in Black star said it would be ""awkward"" to attend in the light of the row about the lack of representation among this year's acting nominees. ""We're uncomfortable to stand there and say that this is OK,"" he told Good Morning America's Robin Roberts. Comedian Chris Rock is facing calls to withdraw from his role as host of this year's ceremony as the row intensifies. In an interview aired on Thursday, Smith said diversity was ""the American super-power"" and that, ""at its best, Hollywood creates the imagery for that beauty"". When he looked at this year's all-white line-up of acting nominees, he went on, ""it's not reflecting that beauty."" ""Everybody is beautiful and deserving and fantastic, but it feels like it's going the wrong direction,"" he continued. ""There's a regressive slide towards separatism, towards racial and religious disharmony and that's not the Hollywood I want to leave behind."" Some had expected Smith, a two-time Oscar nominee, to be shortlisted again for Concussion, in which he plays a doctor investigating head injuries sustained by American football players. The Independence Day actor, however, insisted his own part in the debate was nominal. ""This is so deeply not about me,"" he said. ""This is about children who are going to sit down to watch this show and they are not going to see themselves represented."" Smith's comments will add further fuel to an issue that is threatening to overshadow this year's awards, to be held in Los Angeles on 28 February. They will also heap further pressure on Rock, whose role as host of the ceremony is increasingly becoming divisive. ""Please do not do the Oscars awards,"" wrote rapper 50 Cent on Instagram. ""You mean a lot man, don't do it. Please."" Fast & Furious 7 star Tyrese Gibson has also called on Rock to step down. The actor said there was ""no joke that [Rock] can crack"" that would make up for the Academy's failure to nominate a single non-white acting nominee. ""There is no way for him to seize the moment... and say, 'I'm going to say this and say that I'm going to address the issue but then I'm still going to keep my gig as the host',"" Gibson told USA Today. ""The statement that you make is that you step down."" Speaking at Wednesday's National Television Awards in London, Dustin Hoffman said the all-white line-up was an example of the ""subliminal racism"" that exists throughout American society. In an interview with the BBC's Will Gompertz, though, Birdman star Michael Keaton said the Academy's voters had not been ""maliciously prejudicial"" in overlooking black and other minority actors for the second year in succession. ""I just think they're possibly out of touch,"" he continued. Mark Ruffalo, Keaton's co-star in journalism-based drama Spotlight, is one of the 20 all-white candidates up for this year's acting accolades. At the London premiere of Spotlight on Wednesday night, the Avengers star said he supported those calling for a boycott ""in essence"" but would still be attending the ceremony. ""I have a lot of sympathy for [the boycott] and I completely understand why people are protesting. They have to,"" he told reporters. ""Except I'm in a movie that's representing a whole other group of disenfranchised people who have no voice in the world and this movie means so much to them. ""And so... I have to demur and I have to stand up for the people I have to stand up for."" Released in the UK on 29 January, Spotlight tells of an investigation by journalists at the Boston Globe newspaper into the widespread sexual abuse of children in the Catholic Church. Talks of a boycott have been stoked by Spike Lee and Jada Pinkett Smith's separate declarations that they would not be attending or watching this year's event. In an interview on Wednesday, however, Lee said he had never used the word ""boycott"" in a statement he posted protesting against the ""lilly white"" event. The Do the Right Thing film-maker also said he would ""support [Rock] either way"" whether he chose to host the Oscars or not. Record producer Quincy Jones is another to have qualms about attending the Oscars, revealing he had been asked to present an award on 28 February. ""I'm going to ask [them] to let me speak for five minutes on the lack of diversity,"" he told the Hollywood Reporter. ""If not, I'm not going to [present]."" Rock himself has largely kept his counsel about his presenting role, beyond calling the Oscars ""The White BET Awards"" in a promotional tweet for the telecast. The joke refers to the annual awards presented by the Black Entertainment Television network that celebrate the achievements of African Americans and other minorities in music, acting and sports. When Rock previously hosted the Oscars in 2005, however, he took numerous jabs at the Academy, describing the event at one point as ""kinda like Def Oscar Jam"" for including four black actors among the acting nominees. Comedian and talk show host Arsenio Hall is among those calling on Rock not to step down, tweeting that it was ""so important"" for him to be ""on the mic[rophone] that nite [sic]."" Comedian Kevin Hart, meanwhile, told Radio 5 live on Wednesday that ""this should not be thrown on [Rock's] shoulders"". ""Chris Rock is a person who has no problem speaking his mind,"" he said. ""What he chooses to do with this platform is his choice."" Michael B Jordan and Britain's Idris Elba are among other stars who some feel were unfairly overlooked this year in favour of white performers. Elba delivered an address at the Houses of Parliament on Monday in which he called for greater diversity in the media, the full text of which is now available online.","Will Smith has confirmed he will be joining his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, in not attending the Oscars next month."
"Mark Wallinger and Chris Ofili will work with choreographers on the venture, inspired by three works by the Renaissance painter Titian. The project will culminate in a Titian display at the gallery and three one-act ballets at the Royal Opera House. Poet Laureate Carol Ann Duffy and poet Simon Armitage are also involved in the ambitious collaboration. According to organisers, it will aim to bring British artists and dancers together to celebrate some of the most valuable paintings in the National Gallery's collection. Wayne McGregor and Christopher Wheeldon are among the choreographers involved in the project, which will take Ovid's epic Roman poem Metamorphoses as its inspiration. Titian himself used the poem as the basis for his paintings Diana and Actaeon and its sister work, Diana and Callisto. The ballets will premiere at the Royal Opera House in the summer of 2012.",Two Turner Prize winners are to team up with the Royal Ballet and the National Gallery for a 2012 Olympic project.
"By Mark SavageBBC Music reporter In case you've forgotten, Timberlake ripped a panel off Jackson's bodice during the 2004 Super Bowl, revealing her right breast to 114m TV viewers. Although both artists apologised, it was Jackson who got fined and blacklisted by US radio and MTV. ""I stumbled through it,"" Timberlake told Zane Lowe about the aftermath. ""To be quite honest, I had my wires crossed. ""It's just something that you have to look back on and go, 'OK, you can't change what's happened, but you can move forward and learn from it.'"" The star was speaking to Beats 1 radio ahead of his performance at this year's Super Bowl half-time show, on Sunday 4 February. Lowe asked whether he and Jackson had taken time to ""resolve the situation"" and ""make peace"" after the wardrobe malfunction. ""Absolutely,"" he replied. ""I don't know that a lot of people know that. ""I don't think it's my job to do that [discuss behind-the-scenes conversations] because you value the relationships that you do have with people."" 'Hot and steamy' Timberlake previously received criticism for a perceived lack of support for Jackson. In a TV interview immediately after their performance, he appeared to suggest the nudity was planned. ""It was fun. It was quick, slick, to the point,"" he told Access Hollywood. ""You guys were getting pretty hot and steamy up there,"" the show's host, Pat O'Brien, pointed out. ""Hey man, we love giving you all something to talk about,"" Timberlake laughed. Jackson, however, issued a more fulsome apology, in which she explained that Timberlake was only supposed to reveal her red lace bra. ""It was not my intention that it go as far as it did,"" she said. ""I apologise to anyone offended."" Both singers seem shocked as soon as they realise Jackson's bejewelled breast has been exposed. Although the television cameras quickly cut away, subsequent photographs show Jackson covering her breast with a look of horror. A few days later, Timberlake reflected this side of the performance in a more sober interview with US radio station KCBS. ""I immediately looked at her, they brought a towel up onstage, I immediately covered her up. ""I was completely embarrassed, just walked off the stage as quick as I could."" In the aftermath of ""nipplegate"", many people noted double standards in the treatment of the two performers. While Jackson's videos were blacklisted by MTV (who produced the Super Bowl show) Timberlake continued to enjoy their support. And, after CBS rescinded Jackson's invitation to present at that year's Grammy Awards, Timberlake was allowed to attend, and won the awards for best male pop vocal performance and best pop vocal album. In 2006, Oprah Winfrey asked Jackson if Timberlake had ""left you out there hanging"" (what an unfortunate choice of words). ""To a certain degree, yeah,"" she replied. ""We haven't spoken. But I consider him a friend, and I'm very loyal,"" she added. ""He has reached out to speak with me... and in my own time, I'll give him a call."" Around the same time, Timberlake seemed to accept he had let her down. ""If there was something I could have done in her defence that was more than I realised then, I would have,"" he told MTV. ""I probably got 10 percent of the blame, and that says something about society. ""I think that America's harsher on women… And I think that America is, you know, unfairly harsh on ethnic people."" Despite his apologies, many fans reacted badly when he was announced as the half-time performer for this year's Super Bowl. The news spawned a #JusticeforJanet hashtag on Twitter, with demands that she be invited to perform alongside him. Billboard magazine also ran a prominent column demanding that Timberlake make amends. ""Inviting Jackson to perform with him would be an incredible showing of solidarity,"" wrote Alexa Shouneyia. ""Timberlake standing at Jackson's side and sharing the spotlight with her projects the sentiment that while he may not be able to help his privilege, he can share it with Jackson, and give her the same opportunity to shine."" Timberlake hasn't responded to those demands. But he acknowledged to Zane Lowe that the 2004 incident had been raised during discussions with the NFL over his return to the Super Bowl stage. ""It's just one of those things were you go, like, 'Yeah, what do you want me to say?'"" he said. ""We're not going to do that again.""

"Work was carried out on the gravestone because it was covered in lipstick marks left by tourists, which was gradually destroying it. Actor Rupert Everett, who has penned a screenplay about Wilde, said the tomb was ""being eaten away by lipstick"". The star attended the ceremony along with Wilde's grandson Merlin Holland. The tomb was designed by Modernist sculptor Jacob Epstein and survived almost unscathed until 1985. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Everett said: ""The Irish government have taken it upon themselves to renovate the Epstein gravestone, which is literally being eaten away by lipstick, endless women kissing it."" The glass barrier prevents visitors from touching the stonework, although tourists have already started leaving their lipstick marks on a nearby tree. Everett, who starred in the 2002 film version of Wilde's The Importance of Being Earnest, said: ""I find him very inspiring and touching, not just for his genius, also for his stupidity, in a way. ""He was a human being, and made mistakes like everyone else."" Wilde was convicted of gross indecency in 1895 and was sentenced to two years in prison in the wake of his love affair with Lord Alfred Douglas. During his trial he had attempted to explain his attitude to kissing boys and men. ""Kisses for Oscar Wilde were not just signs of love, he associated them with danger, even death,"" said Everett. Mr Holland said he was grateful to the Irish government for restoring the tomb. ""The royalties on Oscar Wilde's works disappeared many many years ago, and there's no way I could possibly have raised the money to do this myself. ""If my grandfather had been here he would have loved the attention,"" he added.","Oscar Wilde's restored tomb has been unveiled in Paris, complete with a glass barrier to make it ""kiss-proof""."
"The 11 letters, written by the 21-year-old Freud to his first girlfriend in the 1940s, are expected to fetch up to £5,000 when they are sold at Sotheby's. Three drawings by the late artist from the same period will also be auctioned. Another work, a portrait of his friend Lady Lambton painted in the 1960s, is tipped to fetch up to £3.5m. Freud, one of Britain's most distinguished and highly regarded artists, died in 2011 aged 88. According to Sotheby's, Freud's letters to fellow art student Felicity Hellaby ""provide a fascinating insight into the artist's early preoccupations"". Written in an uneven hand and peppered with illustrations, ""they also give a keen sense of the determination and focus that were to underpin his approach to art"". They also show a limited grasp of spelling, with ""delishious"", ""postphoned"" and ""spontanious"" among his more egregious mistakes. In his missives, the young artist describes his developing style, writing: ""One day I think I am beginning to make my work how I want it to be and then I feel so dissatisfied with it that I leave the house"". He also talks about buying a ""large Zebra's head"" which ""looks very strange on the wall"". ""By far the best thing I have ever bought,"" he concludes. The letters and the drawings that are being offered for auction with them have been in Hellaby's possession since the 1940s. Now in her nineties, Hellaby recently remembered him being a ""very funny"" and ""incredibly charming"" man destined for ""extraordinary things"". Head on a Green Sofa (1960-61), a portrait of the noted socialite born Belinda Blew-Jones in 1921, was considered by Freud to be one of the best ever works. After becoming Belinda, Lady Lambton at the age of 18, ""Bindy"" became one of Freud's main supporters and helped him secure numerous lucrative commissions. According to Sotheby's, the ""exceptional"" painting ""beautifully captures the form of the woman who was to play such a central role in Freud's life for over two decades"". Painted during ""a period of pivotal change in the artist's work"", it was last seen in London as part of the National Portrait Gallery's 2012 Freud retrospective. Head on a Green Sofa goes under the hammer on Wednesday, while the letters and drawings will be auctioned the following day.",Unpublished letters and drawings by the young Lucian Freud are to be offered at auction in London beside a major portrait he painted later in life.
"The teenager played Sir William Walton's Cello Concerto with the Northern Sinfonia at the competition's final at The Sage in Gateshead. Accepting the £2,000 prize, van der Heijden, from East Sussex, said she felt ""amazing"" and ""so, so lucky"". She beat pianist Yuanfan Yang and Charlotte Barbour-Condini, the final's first ever recorder player. Born in England to a Dutch father and a Swiss mother, van der Heijden started her musical education with the recorder at the age of four. She soon progressed to the piano and then the cello at the age of six. Since late 2008, she has been a student of the British-Russian cellist Leonid Gorokhov. Last year they performed together at the Brighton Festival and in Germany. Her winning performance on Sunday was something of a risk as the Walton concerto is not a well-known piece. ""It's not played very often, but I think it deserves to be played,"" she said. ""The colours and ideas in it... it's a very imaginative piece."" Conductor Kirill Karabits, who was leading the Sinfonia, said: ""I really understand why she wanted to play that. It suits her really well. She enters in the music and it changes her."" The Young Musician contest is held biennially, and was previously known as Young Musician Of The Year. The competition's last winner - pianist Lara Melda - gave a guest performance at Sunday's final. Her predecessor, trombone player Peter Moore, became the youngest ever winner when he took the prize aged 12 in 2008.",Fifteen-year-old cellist Laura van der Heijden has won the BBC's Young Musician prize for 2012.
"By Mark SavageBBC music reporter The record was written and recorded during the coronavirus lockdown, and swerves away from the pop sound that's dominated her last three albums. On Spotify, it achieved 80.6m streams in a single day, the highest-ever tally for a female artist. In the US it sold 846,000 copies, making it the best-selling record of the year after just seven days on sale. Swift also becomes the first artist in US chart history to have seven albums sell more than 500,000 copies in a single week; and the first female artist to have seven albums debut at number one. Her single Cardigan also entered the Hot 100 at number one, making her the first person ever to debut at the top of the album and singles chart in the same week. As well as topping the US Billboard chart, Folklore has reached the summit in the UK, Finland, Australia, Norway, New Zealand and Belgium. In Ireland, Swift now has five number one albums - more than any other female artist in the 21st Century - overtaking Madonna and Beyoncé. The success of the record also gave Swift three top 10 singles in the UK, with Cardigan entering the charts at six, followed by the Bon Iver duet Exile at eight, and Folklore's opening track The 1 at number 10. Chart rules currently prevent an artist from having more than three tracks in the Top 100 at any given time. Otherwise, Swift would have had another 12 new entries - at numbers 13, 15, 18, 21, 24, 31, 36, 37, 40, 42, 45 and 51. Recorded largely with Aaron Dessner of alternative rock band The National, Folklore has earned Swift the best reviews of her career - with an average score of 89% on review aggregation site Metacritic. The album ""feels fresh, forward-thinking and, most of all, honest,"" said the NME in a four-star review. ""The glossy production she's lent on for the past half-decade is cast aside for simpler, softer melodies and wistful instrumentation."" Variety magazine called it ""a highly subdued but rich affair"", although the New York Times said the 16-track album was occasionally ""suffocating"", with Dessner's production ""like wet clothing tugging at Swift, slowing her down, sapping her vim"". Folklore's record-breaking first week was achieved on the basis of streams and downloads alone. The project was so secret that even employees of her own record label were unaware of its existence until hours before its release; and so last-minute that physical copies of the album could not be manufactured in time. The album could see a second sales boost when CDs become available at the end of this week; while vinyl copies are not due to hit stores until November.

"Hewlett died at the age of 58 last month, having shared his experience of coping with cancer on BBC Radio 4. He was told of the honour in January, saying he was ""touched"" by the accolade. Awards chair Stewart Purvis said he had ""achieved so much"". A scholarship has been launched in his name to help students from lower income families studying broadcast journalism. One recipient each year will be presented with the Steve Hewlett Scholarship, which has been set up by the RTS and The Media Society. As well as a financial contribution to their studies, the recipient will be mentored by RTS members and former colleagues of Hewlett. Hewlett's sons collected the judges' award on his behalf.

"By Mark SavageBBC Music reporter Over the course of the weekend, more than 2,000 acts will play on the festival's stages - but all eyes will be on the main headliners: Radiohead, Foo Fighters and Ed Sheeran. All three spoke to Radio 1's Annie Mac this week, discussing their hopes and fears for the festival. Here's what they had to say, and a look at their history at Glastonbury. Radiohead are headlining Glastonbury for the third time, 20 years after they first topped the bill. That show, played just two weeks after the release of OK Computer, was named the best gig of all time by Q Magazine but Thom Yorke recently revealed he nearly walked off stage in frustration after the band's monitors blew up, leaving them unable to hear each other. ""I just went over to Ed [O'Brien, guitarist] and said, 'I'm off mate, see you later,'"" he told BBC 6 Music. ""He turned around and went, 'If you do, you'll probably live the rest of your life regretting it.' I went, 'Good point.'"" In the intervening years, Radiohead have done more than any other band to push the boundaries of rock music, stretching dark, brooding electronics over Yorke's keening vocals. Their most recent album, A Moon Shaped Pool, rekindled their relationship with melody, and is bound to form the core of their set on Friday night. Annie Mac: How are you all feeling about this? Ed O'Brien: To be honest, a little nervous. A few days ago we were doing the setlist for a show in Denmark and we all fessed up: We had the Glastonbury tingles. You know, that anticipation and slight nerves. It means a lot. It's a huge one. What does it feel like to stand on that stage and look out to 100,000 people? The first time we played it in '97, it felt like we were looking out upon this scene of devastation. The rain was horrendous. But the interesting thing is, when it's really right, it doesn't feel like there's a divide. There's a feeling of the band and the audience experiencing this thing together. Can you tell us anything at all about what you'll be doing on Friday night? There won't be any sort of guest appearances! I thought that Coldplay with Barry Gibb last year was brilliant [but] we're not that kind of band. What advice would you give to people who are virgin Glastonbury headliners? It's all about humility. For me, the bands who don't do it on that stage - or anywhere in Glastonbury - are the ones who turn up with their shades on, and it's all about them. You've got to remember, you're just closing the night. You're not headlining, you're one part of this huge, great, amazing beautiful festival. You're providing maybe two hours of soundtrack to people's enjoyment and experience at that moment. You've got to leave your ego and shades at the gate. Foo Fighters were all set to headline Glastonbury two years ago when Dave Grohl fell off stage and broke his leg in Gothenburg, Sweden. With two weeks' notice, Florence + The Machine were drafted in to take the band's slot, and Grohl spent the rest of the year recuperating (and performing from a specially-constructed throne). Now, he's back on two feet, and ready to rock. Powered by a seemingly endless supply of both hit singles and rock star charisma, the band are perfect headliner material. Fist-pumping anthems like The Pretender, Best of You and Times Like These are likely to be joined by new single Run, but hopefully the band will avoid the temptation to break out brand new tracks from the forthcoming album Concrete & Gold - ""a record that sounds like Motorhead doing Sgt Pepper's,"" according to Grohl. Expect the mosh pit to be full for this one. Annie Mac: Would it be right to say this show will be a pinnacle in your career? Dave Grohl: We last played Glastonbury in 1998 and we were in our infancy then. We were halfway down the bill, it was pouring with rain and I think there was some sort of Euro cup final thing happening, so about 90% of the audience disappeared once we hit the stage. We were supposed to be back a couple of years ago and unfortunately I had to call in sick. So this is a big make-up date for me. We get to headline Glastonbury but also I get to do it standing on two legs. It means a lot to me, personally. It's part of my recovery in a weird way. You've had two extra years of a build-up to this headlining slot. Are you feeling like it's going to be better than it was then? Now there's more purpose to us playing the gig. You know, Florence + The Machine took our place as headliners and I saw footage of them playing one of our songs, Times Like These, and I got really emotional and thought, ""What a beautiful gesture"". But [it was] also a beautiful moment that connected the band and the audience, so I can't wait to play that song. I've been thinking about this for two years. Playing a song like Times Like These in front of that audience for the first time, standing up on two legs, is huge. It's a big deal, personally. In just six short years, Ed Sheeran has graduated from Glastonbury's tiny Croissant Neuf stage to the top of the bill. He proved his ability to get people on his side in 2014, when he inherited Dolly Parton's record-breaking Pyramid Stage audience, and got them all waving their shirts in the air during Sing. Amazingly, he does all of this by himself. No band, no backing singers, no pyrotechnics. It's just Ed, slapping his hand against his acoustic guitar and layering up harmonies on a loop pedal, like a digital one man band. Music snobs might turn their noses up at his more saccharine songs, but the Sunday night slot is traditionally reserved for an artist who can bring the crowd together for an undemanding sing-song. And in that respect, Ed fits the bill perfectly. Annie Mac: How are you feeling about this weekend? Ed Sheeran: Really, really, really excited. I'm actually more excited about this than I was about playing Wembley [Stadium] - because when you're playing your own shows, you're not really winning anyone over. They've all parted with cash to buy a ticket. Knowing that there are people in the audience that possibly don't like my music at all... that excites me. What's the plan for the set? I'm doing it all by myself. I think the key to any festival set is just play songs that people know. I'm not going to be like, ""here's a new song that I wrote last week"". It's all going to be songs people have heard. Some [of the] songs I don't even play in my set anymore because they've been over done, but I'm remembering that this is the first time that a lot of people are going to see me. What about getting some special guests out... like Stormzy? Stormzy is playing on Friday, so I don't think he's going to be around. But Beoga - who are the Irish band that play on Galway Girl - are there on Sunday, so I might get them up and have a bit of a jam. Will you be at the festival all weekend? I don't like big crowds of people, ironically! So I'm not a big festival-goer. I'm actually taking the opportunity to be at home for two days and then I'm going to go in on Sunday. And I've got every single member of my family coming so it's going to be like a wedding reception afterwards. Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

Up All Night, the album from pop band One Direction is at number 6, while Adele's 21 is at number 8 - marking its 69th week in the US charts. It is the seventh time this year that three British acts have been in the American Top 10 simultaneously. Other UK acts to score hit albums include Coldplay, Florence + The Machine, Snow Patrol, Paul McCartney and The Wanted. Sheeran's debut is the highest by a UK male solo artist since 2006 - when Radiohead singer Thom Yorke entered the chart at number two with his first solo record, The Eraser. It comes in a successful year for 21-year-old, who won two Brit awards for best breakthrough act and best male artist in February. He also performed at the Queen's Diamond Jubilee concert at Buckingham Palace in June. His debut album was the ninth biggest-seller in the UK last year, notching up 791,000 sales.

"The changes, which will see BBC Online's budget cut by £34m, will also result in the loss of up to 360 posts over the next two years. Among the sites to close include teen services Switch and Blast and community site 606. The plans are part of the BBC's cost-cutting measures to make 20% savings as a result of the licence fee settlement. The BBC says the changes are intended to make its website more distinctive and reduce competition with commercial websites. Skills website RAW and documentary website Video Nation will also be closed under the reorganisation. Community site h2g2 will also be disposed of. Other reductions include the replacement of the majority of programme websites with automated content and the automation of bespoke digital radio sites 1Xtra, 5 live sports extra, 6 Music and Radio 7. 'Refocusing priorities' There will be fewer news blogs while standalone forums, communities and message-boards will be reduced and replaced with integrated social tools. There will also be a reduction in the overall amount of sports news, live sport and showbusiness news, but also more culture and arts coverage on the news website. Local sites will additionally no longer publish non-news features content. About 180 websites are expected to close ahead of schedule later this year. The overall changes will be made by February 2013-14. BBC director general Mark Thompson said: ""BBC Online is a huge success, but our vast portfolio of websites means we sometimes fall short of expectation. ""A refocusing on our editorial priorities, a commitment to the highest quality standards, and a more streamlined and collegiate way of working will help us transform BBC Online for the future."" He acknowledged the changes would be ""painful"" but insisted BBC Online ""lies at the heart"" of the corporation's digital future. The National Union of Journalists (NUJ) condemned the move. ""The attack on BBC jobs and online services shows the BBC's contempt for hard-working staff. It makes no sense to cut back the BBC website as increasing numbers of people rely on the internet,"" said NUJ secretary Jeremy Dear. ""The NUJ will not stand by idly if members are forced out of their jobs,"" he added. As part of the BBC's Putting Quality First strategy, BBC Online will form 10 distinctive areas: News, Sport, Weather, CBeebies, CBBC, Knowledge & Learning, Radio & Music, TV & iPlayer, Homepage and Search. 'Better service' Roly Keating, the BBC's director of archive content, said the website had ""grown like Topsy"", adding ""we just don't need"" the sites that are to be closed. He said the BBC's online offering would become easier to navigate. Erik Huggers, the BBC's Director of Future Media and Technology, said the corporation had created a single, united strategy, making ""a better service for audiences"". Editorial focus would be on high-quality news, clearer local sites on news, sport, weather and travel and creative spaces for children. The iPlayer will also be reshaped, bringing together programming and programming information with archive content. The BBC also published a list of things it would not do in future. These commitments include not to launch a social networking site, publish local listings, run online-only music sessions or pay for exclusive online sports rights. The corporation also said it wanted to double the number of referrals to external websites to 22 million each month by 2013/14. The BBC has previously come under fire from other media organisations for the wide-ranging nature of its output. In 2009, James Murdoch accused it of a ""land grab"" in a struggling media market and said its news operation was ""throttling"" competition. The current BBC Online budget is £137m.",The BBC is to cut about 200 websites as it reduces the amount of money it spends on its online output.

"The singer cancelled all performances from August last year after her husband, Rene Angelil, was diagnosed with throat cancer for the second time.

"By Emma Jones Arts and entertainment reporter, BBC News '71, the debut feature film by French director Yann Demange, sees 24-year-old actor Jack O' Connell play Private Gary Hook, a teenage soldier from Derby who is sent to Belfast on a tour of duty in 1971, when some of the worst sectarian violence was taking place. After a stand-off between the Royal Ulster Constabulary and residents of a Catholic neighbourhood, Private Hook is abandoned behind enemy lines, and at the mercy of extremists on both sides. O'Connell, who also grew up in Derby, says he felt an affinity with the role - at the age of 15, he too seriously considered signing up to army life. ""I was a bit like Gary Hook, although definitely more educated on something like Northern Ireland because I'm half Irish,"" he says. ""But Gary's reason for joining the army isn't political, it's personal - he's searching for that sense of belonging. ""I was affected by the same kind of propaganda - there was a time in my life when I wanted to join the army, probably for all the wrong reasons, and now I feel that I dodged a bullet, quite literally. ""I was really susceptible to that false depiction of a glamorous military lifestyle. I hope this film, '71, gives a genuine insight into what they sign up for, not a manipulated ideal. In my opinion, it's quite disgusting."" Written by Scottish playwright Gregory Burke, and filmed in the North of England rather than in Belfast , '71 had a world premiere at the Berlin International Film Festival in February this year. Critics praised both the actor and the film, with the Daily Telegraph calling it ""a stunningly well-crafted survival thriller"". Its star though, says the plot is secondary to the harsh reality of everyday life in 1970s Belfast, as portrayed in the film. ""I wouldn't watch a film that tried to glamorise this topic. Partly because of my Irish background - it would make me feel repulsed. ""However, this film shows the grim horror of what was going on in those times. Too often it gets swept under a rock and is never unearthed. ""Culture gives us the ability to document these things from an honest angle, not the one that is favoured from powerful people - perhaps those who were responsible for the conflict in the first place. ""We've tried to be honest and unbiased and not accuse any sides, even though we choose to see everything from a British soldier's eyes. ""I don't think that even 40 years later there's enough water under the bridge that's gone by to just do a slick thriller. I've spent time in Belfast and I sense that to some people, those times are still very present. It would just be criminal to try and market something that was just downright insensitive. ""This though tells some important truths."" O'Connell, who made his movie debut as a teenager in 2006's film This is England by Shane Meadows, went on to star in the E4 series Skins and opposite Michael Caine in Harry Brown. He received rave reviews last year for David Mackenzie's prison drama Starred Up, and has just completed filming the lead role of Louis Zamperini - the Olympic athlete taken prisoner by the Japanese during World War Two - on Angelina Jolie's biopic Unbroken. With another part opposite Cara Delavigne for The Weinstein Company's adaptation of the novel Tulip Fever, the actor seems confirmed as a rising star. But he adds that, as a teenager, he was a ""bad boy"" - which is why he sought to channel his energies into the military. ""I joined the Cadets in the hope of speeding up enrolment because I didn't have a spotless record, for one reason or another. ""What changed my mind? Well, I guess I just listened to my mother in the end. ""I'm just glad I did listen to her and continued to act. I'm very glad to be sitting here as a man of 24, as an actor, hopefully portraying for the right reasons everything I thankfully avoided."" O'Connell describes his time working with Jolie, who directed him in the part of Louis Zamperini, as ""really motivational - she's a real encourager, and she knows exactly what she wants on set."" But although he's prepared for intense scrutiny when it's released in December, he says "" character"" roles are what he wants to do. ""I just want to do parts where I feel I'm doing an important thing about telling the story. ""Right now I feel really lucky, I just want to keep my head down, and get on with the job."" '71 is screening at the BFI London Film Festival and is released on 10 October in the UK.","Attempts from within the military and outside to ""glamorise"" army life are ""disgusting"", according to the star of a British thriller depicting life in Northern Ireland at the height of the Troubles, and who almost joined the army due to a perceived ""manipulated ideal""."
"The two long-running series helped make him a household name and earned him the honour for services to drama. The 67-year-old said: ""I don't really deserve it. People who get OBEs are people like firefighters and lifesavers - these are real-life heroes."" He is leaving Midsomer Murders next year after starring it in for 15 years. ""I think it's absolutely wonderful, I cannot be more pleased. For an actor to get an award like this is lovely and very kind,"" he said. The star revealed that he thought the Queen was a fan of DCI Barnaby - the character he plays in Midsomer. ""The story is that she is, and I hope that's true. I'm told on good authority - back in the days of Princess Margaret - the Queen Mum and Princess Margaret used to have discussions about the pronunciation of Midsomer - I don't know the answer,"" he said.","Actor John Nettles, best-known for playing detectives in the TV dramas Bergerac and Midsomer Murders, has received an OBE from the Queen."
"Speaking to the BBC, Blackman said Angelou left a ""great legacy"": I have incredible sadness at her passing. She had a good innings but was such an inspiration. She's like Nelson Mandela, you think they're going to live forever. She was so inspirational with her stories and poems. Her quote ""Courage is the most important of all the virtues because without courage, you can't practice any other virtue consistently"" - it was things like that, that resonated and stayed with me. I saw her in concert twice but was never fortunate to meet her. But I got to read and see her work and she was such an amazing performer. She was a woman full of wisdom - she didn't get old, she got wiser and wiser. She's left behind a great legacy. Her impact came with her poems like Still I Rise, which says life knocks you down but you get up again. It was about having courage as a person, as a woman, and as a black woman for me. I think she was such a phenomenal person, who didn't let life beat her and she got stronger and wiser and that's a good message for all of us. It's a sad day, but at least we have her words and work left behind.","UK children's Laureate Malorie Blackman has spoken about her ""incredible sadness"" at the death of poet and activist Maya Angelou at the age of 86."
"The star said that previously unheard material should not be made public as it did not have Jackson's blessing. ""How you gonna release Michael Jackson when Michael Jackson ain't here to bless it?"" he told the Associated Press news agency. Jackson collaborated with Will.i.am before his death last year. The only songs to be issued from their extensive recording sessions are a clutch of remixes featured on a re-release of Thriller in 2008. The Black Eyed Peas' star said Jackson had been very particular about all aspects of his musical productions, from vocals to arrangements and instrumentation. ""He was a perfectionist and he wouldn't have wanted it that way,"" he said of the new album, which Sony is expected to release in November. ""I don't think that should ever come out. Now that he is not part of the process, what are they doing? Why would you put a record out like that? ""Because he was a friend of mine, I just think that's disrespectful. ""What's wrong with what he already contributed to the world?"" Jackson's former manager, Frank DiLeo, told Rolling Stone magazine on Monday that the new album would consist of of 10 previously unreleased tracks, chosen from more than 100 songs held in Jackson's archive. ""There are a couple of songs we recorded for the Bad album that we had to cut that are just sensational,"" he said.",Black Eyed Peas frontman Will.i.am has criticised plans to release a new Michael Jackson album in November this year.

"By Neil SmithEntertainment reporter, BBC News The drama is one of hundreds to screen at the Canadian event, one of the largest and most prestigious on the annual film festival calendar. Benedict Cumberbatch All eyes will be on the saturnine Sherlock actor this week to see how he portrays controversial WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in Toronto opener The Fifth Estate. The 37-year-old adopts an Australian accent and a shock of white hair to play the whistle-blowing activist responsible for the leaking of thousands of confidential documents and images. This will not be all Toronto sees of Cumberbatch, who shares the screen with Meryl Streep, Julia Roberts and Ewan McGregor in the darkly comic family drama August: Osage County. And he also appears as a Baptist preacher in 12 Years a Slave, Steve McQueen's film about a free black man from upstate New York who was kidnapped and sold into slavery in 1841. The powerful story of Solomon Northup gives the London-born Ejiofor one of the most dramatic and eye-catching roles of his career to date. Small wonder he is already been talked about as a potential Oscar candidate for 12 Years a Slave - a film that, like Django Unchained last year, shines a spotlight on the cruelty and injustices of the slave trade. Ejiofor will also be seen in Toronto in Half of a Yellow Sun, a drama about life in Nigeria during the civil war that gripped the west African country in the late 1960s. The 36-year-old - rumoured to have been offered the lead in Doctor Who in 2008 - co-stars with Thandie Newton in Biyi Bandele's film of Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's 2007 Orange Prize-winning novel. Another Briton being tipped for awards glory is Elba, the charismatic star of The Wire, Luther and upcoming comic book sequel Thor: The Dark World. The 40-year-old takes the title role in Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom, a biopic of the former South African president that dramatises his early life, his political activism and the 27 years he spent incarcerated. Skyfall star Naomie Harris plays Winnie Mandela in Justin Chadwick's film, which has its world premiere in Toronto on 8 September. Its debut coincides with the belated release next month of another film about Winnie, starring Jennifer Hudson in the title role, that had its premiere at Toronto two years ago. Around this time last year, Ralph Fiennes could be seen playing Magwitch in a film version of Charles Dickens's Great Expectations. The actor continues his association with the British author by playing him in The Invisible Woman, a drama exploring Dickens's relationship with his secret lover and muse Nelly Ternan. Fiennes also directs the BBC-funded period drama, which co-stars Felicity Jones as Nelly and Kristin Scott Thomas as her mother Catherine. Fiennes and Scott Thomas famously appeared together in 1996 Oscar-winner The English Patient. Three years ago, Colin Firth spent his 50th birthday attending a gala screening of The King's Speech at the Toronto Film Festival. Tom Hooper's film went on to be a box office smash and win its star a host of accolades, among them an Oscar, a Bafta and a Golden Globe. Firth will no doubt be hoping his new film, The Railway Man, about a British army officer haunted by his time as a Japanese prisoner of war, receives a no less rapturous reception when it premieres in Toronto on 6 September. The British actor will also be seen at the festival in Devil's Knot, another fact-based drama exploring the case of the ""West Memphis Three"" - three teenagers convicted of murdering three children in Arkansas in 1993. Can a Song Save Your Life? That is the question Knightley hopes to answer in John Carney's film, which has its world premiere in Toronto on 7 September. The 28-year-old plays an aspiring singer-songwriter who teams up with a luckless music producer, played by Mark Ruffalo, after being dumped by her rock star boyfriend. The role of her best friend in the film will be played by fellow Brit James Corden, who will also be seen in Toronto in upbeat biopic One Chance. The film sees Corden as Paul Potts, the former mobile phone salesman whose singing abilities saw him crowned the winner of Britain's Got Talent in 2007. Fresh from appearing on the West End stage in The Cripple of Inishmaan, the former Harry Potter actor will be seen at Toronto in no less than three different guises. Perhaps the most striking of these will be Ig, the character he plays in supernatural thriller Horns - a young man who wakes up one morning to find a pair of horns growing from his temples. The 24-year-old will have a more conventional appearance in The F Word, a romantic comedy about a young couple negotiating the early stages of their relationship. And Radcliffe will also be seen as Allen Ginsberg in Kill Your Darlings, a look at the so-called ""Beat Generation"" of US writers that has a gala screening in Toronto following its premiere at Sundance in January.","A look at some of the British talents set to shine at the Toronto International Film Festival, which kicks off on Thursday with the world premiere of WikiLeaks-inspired thriller The Fifth Estate."

The Crimewatch presenter was shot and killed on the doorstep of her home in south west London in April 1999.

The fact that we not only did that, but that we got nine nominations is an incredible acknowledgement of the work we've done,"" Spacey told industry publication Variety. Revived series Arrested Development, which was also produced by Netflix, had three nominations including lead actor in a comedy for Jason Bateman.

"The song made it to number one after the duo performed the track on their ITV show Saturday Night Takeaway last weekend, prompting fans to download it. The pair had several hits in the 1990s as PJ and Duncan, the names of their characters in TV drama Byker Grove. The original Let's Get Ready to Rhumble single got to number nine in 1994. It was their most successful release as PJ and Duncan, although they later re-named themselves Ant & Dec and made it to number three with Fifa's official 2002 World Cup song, On the Ball. The pair, whose real names are Anthony McPartlin and Declan Donnelly, announced earlier this week that they will donate profits from their number one record to ChildLine. 'Bit harder' Speaking on the Chris Evans Breakfast Show on BBC Radio 2, McPartlin said: ""I've been trying to push it under the carpet! People are still buying the track, so we've just decided that any money we make out of it will be put towards ChildLine, as we're patrons of that."" On performing the routine, Donnelly said: ""At 37 it's a little bit harder than 19, it felt a lot quicker than in 1994!"" He added that its new success has ""been bewildering"". The pair also had a number five album in 1994, titled Psyche. Their other hits included Stepping Stone and Stuck On U. After rising to fame on BBC children's series Byker Grove and enjoying their stint as pop singers, they joined ITV in 1998 presenting the Saturday morning shows SM:TV Live and CD:UK. They have fronted several entertainment shows for ITV, such as I'm a Celebrity...

"He is the first star to be re-confirmed for the reality show, which returns later this year. Analysts had suggested the show might be due for a shake-up after its ratings suffered in 2011. ""I'm thrilled to be back and really looking forward to working with The X Factor team again,"" said Barlow in a statement. ""The fact that a superstar could just walk out on that stage is very exciting."" ""See you at auditions,"" he added in a Twitter message to his fans. Show creator Simon Cowell said: ""It's great to be able to confirm our first judge for this year's show. Gary has earned his place and I'm excited to be working with him again."" Cowell was absent from the X Factor panel for the first time last year, as he concentrated on launching a US version of the show. During that time, ratings for the UK edition fell below those of BBC rival Strictly Come Dancing for the first time in a number of years. The audience for the final, when girl group Little Mix won the competition, peaked at 15.5 million viewers. In 2010, a peak of 19.4 million saw Matt Cardle's triumph. In 2009, 19.1 million viewers tuned in. However, the series was still the third-highest rated since X Factor began in 2004, with an average weekly audience of 11 million. The other judges on last year's panel were newcomers Kelly Rowland and Tulisa Contostavlos, alongside regular judge Louis Walsh. The first round of auditions for this year's programme have already been held, but no contestants have been screened by the judges yet.

"The Oscar-nominated star of Can You Ever Forgive Me? is a lifelong fan of the US actress and singer. On social media on Tuesday, Grant shared his childhood letter, in which he offered Streisand a ""two-week holiday, or longer"" at his family home. Streisand replied to the tweet, thanking Grant for the ""wonderful letter"" he sent when he was 14. Grant first sent the letter to the US star when he was growing up in Swaziland, which is now called eSwatini. He shared it on social media on Tuesday, alongside a photograph of himself outside Streisand's home in California. In the letter, Grant wrote: ""You don't know me yet, but I am writing to offer you an idea you might like to consider. My name is Richard and I live in a small African kingdom called Swaziland in south-east Africa."" He told her his family had been avid fans since seeing her Oscar-winning performance in the 1968 film Funny Girl, and owned all her records. ""I read in the paper that you were feeling very tired and pressurised by your fame and failed romance with Mr Ryan O'Neal. I would like to offer you a two week holiday, or longer, at our house, which is very beautiful with a pool and a magnificent view of the Ezulwini Valley.""

"Best known for her documentaries on issues such as body image and polygamy, O'Porter's debut novel was inspired by her experiences growing up in Guernsey. The awards, now in their tenth year, are voted for by Waterstones staff. Other nominees include Call the Midwife actress Emerald Fennell and performance poet Laura Dockrill. Both are nominated in the ""age 5-12"" category for their books Shiverton Hall and Darcy Burdock.

"By Mark SavageBBC music reporter Released in 1987, it made U2 one of the world's biggest bands, thanks to anthems like With Or Without You and Where The Streets Have No Name. Now, listeners to BBC Radio 2's Sounds of the 80s have chosen it as the decade's best record, in a poll marking National Album Day on Saturday. Dire Straits' Brothers In Arms came second, followed by The Stone Roses' eponymous debut. All but one of the top 20 are by male artists, with the exception being Kate Bush's Hounds Of Love - which lands at number 11. The Human League's Dare, which takes sixth place, also features prominent contributions from singers Joanne Catherall and Susan Ann Sulley; while albums by Madonna, Janet Jackson, Tracy Chapman and Grace Jones feature further down the list. The Joshua Tree was almost called The Two Americas. Later, Desert Songs was another contender, before the band settled on The Joshua Tree - a title that perfectly captured the sacred/secular tension of U2's landscaped songs and Biblical imagery. Written against the backdrop of the Cold War, the album reflected two sides of the American dream, with the Irish band seduced by its glamour but repelled by what bassist Adam Clayton called ""the bleakness and greed"" of the Reagan era. ""And it feels like we're right back there in a way,"" said guitarist The Edge, after hearing the results of Radio 2 poll. ""Politics are still so polarised."" He added: ""We've had the privilege of playing The Joshua Tree live all over the world in the last few years and it's almost like the album has come full circle. ""We're just thrilled that people are still connecting with these songs, night after night, year after year."" Produced by Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois, The Joshua Tree won U2 a Grammy for album of the year, and songs like I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For and Bullet The Blue Sky - a criticism of US activities in Central America - have remained staples of their live shows ever since. In the UK, it was the ninth best-selling album of the 1980s, beaten by several records - including Michael Jackson's Bad and Phil Collins' No Jacket Required - which came lower down Radio 2's list. Sounds of the 80s presenter Gary Davies reflected that choosing the ultimate 80s album was a near-impossible task. ""Because there were so many brilliant albums in the 80s, having to choose just one is really difficult,"" he said. However, he added: ""I'm very pleased to see that the Radio 2 listeners have impeccable taste by choosing an album from my all-time favourite band."" A countdown of the audience's top 40 favourite albums will be broadcast on Friday, 9 October from 20:00 BST on Radio 2 and BBC Sounds. National Album Day follows on Saturday, with an 80s theme of its own. Record stores will be stocked with limited editions of classics like ZZ Top's Eliminator, Paul Simon's Graceland, Cyndi Lauper's She's So Unusual, Prefab Sprout's Steve McQueen and Duran Duran's self-titled debut album. On Twitter, Charlatans frontman Tim Burgess will hold an all-day session of his album listening parties, featuring Toyah Willcox (15:00 BST), Marillion (17:30 BST), Matthew Wilder (19:00 BST), Blossoms (20:00 BST) and La Roux (21:00 BST).

"By Emma JonesEntertainment reporter ""I really try my best not to do movies,"" the 66-year-old told BBC News. ""I try not to act because I have so many other things I like to do, like playing guitar. ""Once you commit you are busy so I really try not to engage."" However the star, who won the best actor Oscar in 2010, admitted good scripts were difficult to turn down. He said that was the case for his latest film, crime drama Hell or High Water, in which he plays a Texan sheriff and also stars Star Trek actor Chris Pine and The Program's Ben Foster. ""You get a script like this one, and this cast, and you end up doing [another film]. That seems to be my modus operandi,"" Bridges says. Made by British-born film-maker David Mackenzie - who directed Jack O'Connell crime drama Starred Up - Hell or High Water sees Pine and Foster play brothers in danger of losing the family home, so they rob branches of a bank in order to pay back the mortgage they owe to the same institution. Some critics believe the film, from Sicario screenwriter and actor Taylor Sheridan, is a stinging commentary on many of modern day America's problems. A shoot out after a bank robbery occurs with many gun-carrying members of the public involved, banks are hungry for foreclosed property, and the entire area - called The Comancheria - once belonged to native American tribes who have been displaced. As Bridges admits, ""the film does make you root for the bad guys"", however despite its moral ambiguity the actor doesn't believe that bankers are the villains of the piece. ""The enemy is us,"" he says. ""I am the villain in my own life. We are all in it together, and we're a funky bunch - violent and greedy, but that's us. ""We really are in a dilemma - on gun control, what do we do? The barn doors opened long ago, and the horses are out. I belong to organisations to improve gun safety and it's a problem to know how to control them. They are prolific and it's too late. The right to bear arms was set in motion a long time ago - now how do we navigate the things of history? ""It's the same with nuclear weapons - and look what we did with slavery, and the native Americans. We have never 'fessed up and taken responsibility for these wrongs and it all piles up. Finally the chickens have come home to roost."" Bridges adds he deplores the ""short-sighted view that we can keep progressing and we just look out for ourselves - yet we are connected as a world"". ""I understand Trump's policies because there's a lot of fear, but I don't necessarily think that's the path to take,"" he says. ""I often think of the way all these different people come together to make a movie, to create something beautiful and I wonder - why can't the world be like that? The world's quite a script, we shouldn't throw up our hands and refuse to engage with it."" After its release in North America, Hell or High Water attracted approval ratings of 98% on the critics site Rotten Tomatoes. Previously the script had topped Hollywood's 2012 Black List - an industry survey of ""most-liked"" screenplays not yet made - and Bridges, who played cowboy Rooster Cogburn in the Coen Brothers' western True Grit, calls it ""another western - a modern day one"". ""Take away the cars and you'd be left with a pure old-fashioned western. That genre will never be killed off - it's too fascinating,"" he says.

"The writer told the Guardian newspaper the third book would be called The Mirror And The Light, the title she originally chose for the second novel. She has already started the first sequel, Bring Up the Bodies, which will focus on the downfall of Anne Boleyn. Publishers Fourth Estate say that book will be released in May 2012. Wolf Hall followed the life of Thomas Cromwell from his impoverished beginnings as the son of a violent blacksmith, to his meteoric rise in the court of King Henry VIII. The Mirror And The Light will continue the statesman's story until his execution in 1540. The author said that initially she had not envisioned a trilogy because ""I thought the difficulties of carrying the back story into a third novel would be too great"". She added: ""But all my thinking changed in the last month; it shows how hard it is to make predictions about how a novel will evolve."" Bring up the Bodies will be shorter than the 672-page Wolf Hall, Mantel added. ""It's shorter, more concentrated, covering the action of a few months in close focus. ""If you read 20 different historians on Anne's fall you will get 20 different versions. I can't add to them, but I can try to convey to the reader what it might have been like to be caught up in those events. Thomas Cromwell remains a work in progress."" Mantel was awarded the Booker prize for Wolf Hall in 2009. At the time the panel of judges described the book as ""an extraordinary piece of story-telling"". The book was also awarded the Walter Scott Prize for historical fiction.","Just days after the sequel to Hilary Mantel's Booker Prize-winning novel Wolf Hall was announced, the author has revealed plans for a third instalment."
"Boo! A Madea Halloween, which Perry directed, wrote, co-produced and stars in, took $27.6m (£22.6m) on its opening weekend. Jack Reacher: Never Go Back, the second film in the franchise, debuted at number two with $23m (£18.8m). Last week's number one, The Accountant, dropped to number four after taking a further $14m (£11.4m). The crime drama stars Anna Kendrick and Ben Affleck and tells the story of a man who uses his accountancy office as a front for his work for criminal organisations. Supernatural horror film Ouija: Origin of Evil, a prequel to 2014 film Ouija, took $14.1m (£11.5m) to debut in third place. The Girl on the Train, starring Emily Blunt, rounded off the top five, taking $7.3m (£6m) on its third weekend of release. Further down the top 10, Keeping Up With the Joneses launched with a relatively disappointing $5.6m (£4.6m), landing at number seven. The comedy, which stars Isla Fisher, Gal Gadot and Jon Hamm, received poor review from critics. Coming-of-age drama Moonlight took $415,000 on its first weekend of release despite showing in only four cinemas - an strong result for a film with no big stars and a fairly unknown director, Barry Jenkins. ComScore senior media analyst Paul Dergarabedian said the film, which will expand to further theatres in the coming weeks, ""is going to be on everyone's Oscar radar now"". Analysis by BBC entertainment correspondent Lizo Mzimba Perhaps the most significant US box office figure from the weekend was for a film which didn't even make the top 10. Moonlight, the story of a gay African American man dealing with his sexuality, may have only taken $414,740, but that was in just four cinemas in New York and Los Angeles, meaning in each it took an average of $103,685 - the highest per-screen average of any release in 2016. The independent film has already received a rapturous reception at festivals, as well as being highly praised by many reviewers. Its strong box office performance in the few cinemas it played in means it could also add commercial success to critical success. For the past two years, no non-white performers have been nominated in the Academy's acting categories, leading to the #OscarsSoWhite diversity row. Moonlight, with its black cast, now looks like one of the films that will break that trend. Nominations are probable for Mahershala Ali and Naomie Harris for best supporting actor and actress. It's also more than possible that the film's director Barry Jenkins could be recognised in the best director and best original screenplay categories. The film could well also get a best picture nomination. It will expand to other cities in the next few weeks, and if its momentum continues it looks set to be not only a breakout arthouse hit, but also a serious Oscar contender. Perry's Halloween film, a parody of conventional horror films, is the follow-up to Madea Goes to Jail and Madea's Family Reunion.

"Cornell was found dead in his hotel room after performing a show in Detroit on Wednesday evening. Officials later confirmed he had hanged himself. Singer Alice Cooper called him ""the best voice in rock and roll"" while Sir Elton John said he was ""a great singer, songwriter and the loveliest man"". Cornell, 52, had three children. He was a lead singer and songwriter in the groups Soundgarden and Audioslave. His best-known song was Black Hole Sun, released in 1994. When he recorded You Know My Name for the 2006 film Casino Royale, he became the first male American artist to write a theme song for a James Bond film.

"By John McKie Arts reporter At last year's Superbowl, Strong unveiled his latest villainous part, opposite Sir Ben Kingsley and Tom Hiddleston, in an ad for a popular British car firm. The tagline - ""It's good to be bad"" - had been earned by playing the foe battling both Russell Crowe's Robin Hood and Robert Downey Jr's Sherlock Holmes. His latest stage role as tragic hero Eddie Carbone, the central character in Arthur Miller's A View from the Bridge, has been traditionally denounced as inappropriately obsessive, controlling, bullying and homophobic. But Strong does not see it that way. ""The main challenge for me doing the play was rebuffing people's perceptions of Eddie,"" Strong says about the role that lured him back to the theatre after 12 years in film. ""A View from the Bridge has been done many times and people feel they know the play. His reputation is that of a homophobic, misogynistic bully. ""I did not see it, or want to play him that way - I saw someone who is handicapped by his lack of education, his lack of emotional awareness. Eddie works on the docks in Brooklyn in the 1950s. That is a hard life."" The play is transferring from an acclaimed production at The Young Vic - which saw Strong named best actor and Ivo Van Hove best director at the Critic's Circle Theatre Awards earlier this month - to The Wyndham's Theatre, in the centenary of Arthur Miller's birth. Strong, who has kept up his cinematic profile with recent roles in The Imitation Game and Kingsman, has no doubt why Miller's plays endure. ""Miller now has big audiences, but I am not sure all his plays had big audiences when they were first staged,"" says Strong. ""Creative endeavour should be about taking us out of our everyday lives - work, emails, meetings, paying the bills. It is then the job of the arts to shine a light on what it is to be human. This is what Miller's plays do."" It is not Strong's first contact with the playwright. In 1996 he played Biff to Alun Armstrong's Willy Loman in a National Theatre production of Miller's Death of a Salesman. ""I used to sit on the stage during every performance of the play and marvel at how cleverly Miller had constructed it and how the dialogue fitted together. Everything that was said managed to move the play forward; he managed to tell the story in a very simple way. A View from the Bridge does that too. ""You meet these people and do not know where the play is about to head, and then slowly begin to realise there is unease in the air. You can see this terrible car crash happening in slow motion. His storytelling blows me away."" The role of Willy Loman is known as one which attracts acting heavyweights from early incarnations of Lee Cobb and Rod Steiger, Dustin Hoffman on Broadway and in a 1985 TV movie and Philip Seymour Hoffman in his last stage role. From next month, Sir Antony Sher will play the part for the Royal Shakespeare Company. ""The role has resonance,"" says Strong, ""because all actors realise Willy is a really well-written part. You feel for this guy who just does not really understand what is going on in the modern world. ""He is a guy with his pride, and the modern world has just overtaken him like a rollercoaster ride. Actors understand that it is a part that can make you laugh and cry at the same time."" As to his own intentions, Strong admits: ""I would love to play Willy one day, no question."" While he was part of the National Theatre production, the cast were invited to Salzburg to hear Arthur Miller, who died 10 years ago this month, describe the play. ""He allowed us to come in and read the text with him. He read the part of Willy Loman and also Biff. I remember him basically allowing us to make our own version of his play. ""He did not say 'this is my play, here is how it should be' - he was very open to what we felt we wanted to bring out in our roles for this production."" Strong says Miller also shared stories with the cast, including the origins of one of his most famous plays. ""I do remember Miller saying he wrote the first half of Death of a Salesman in one night. He built a wooden shed at the end of his garden and in it wrote the first half in one night. ""He then took three weeks to write the second half, but even so, three weeks to write one of the greatest plays in the English language is pretty amazing,"" said Strong. Strong has also appeared in Sam Mendes' final season at the Donmar Warehouse and alongside Kevin Spacey in The Iceman Cometh but the conflicted role of Carbone - in what Strong has called ""a stark, bare and brutal"" production of A View from the Bridge - is one of his greatest tests on stage yet. ""Inappropriate relationships are the stuff of drama,"" says Strong. ""Miller writes about the human condition. He holds up a mirror and shows us, through the behaviour of other people, how we behave."" A View from the Bridge is at Wyndham's Theatre until 11 April.","He's currently playing a rare good guy on screen in Kingsman: The Secret Service, but as Mark Strong brings Arthur Miller's A View from the Bridge to the West End, he says there's another way to see the play's notorious bad guy Eddie too - and explains why he thinks the playwright's stories stand the test of time."
"The judge at the High Court said the case should proceed behind closed doors, as publicity would defeat the purpose of the hearing. The BBC began legal action last week to block HarperCollins from publishing an autobiography which would unmask the character. It says the planned book would breach confidentiality obligations. Arguing for HarperCollins, Hugh Tomlinson QC said the press and public should be allowed to hear the legal arguments. He added the press could be subject to extensive restrictions to prevent any confidential information being revealed before the conclusion of the case. But Mr Justice Morgan said: ""It seems to me that having the hearing in private is a much more effective barrier to information which might in due course be the subject of an injunction passing more widely into the public domain."" He said the public interest in ""having justice in open court for all to hear"" could be dealt with by a public judgment given ""in due course"". Last week, HarperCollins said it would ""vigorously defend"" its right to publish the book, adding it was ""disappointed that the BBC has chosen to spend licence fee payers' money to suppress this book"". However Top Gear executive producer Andy Wilman attacked the publisher, writing on the Top Gear website that the BBC had a right to protect Stig's anonymity ""from a bunch of chancers"" who were ""hoping to cash in on it"". The BBC has never confirmed the identity of The Stig - who test drives cars on the show. It maintains that unmasking him would spoil viewers' enjoyment.",A court case to prevent the identity of Top Gear's The Stig from being revealed is to continue being heard in private.
"By Tim MastersEntertainment and arts correspondent, BBC News When Andrew Lloyd Webber was honoured for his contribution to the music industry at last week's Ivor Novello songwriting awards he admitted that he associated such awards with people ""in the twilight days of their career"". That was not accurate in his case, he assured the audience at the glitzy music industry bash in London's Park Lane. He still had plenty of projects on the go. Among them is the song Lord Lloyd-Webber co-wrote with Take That's Gary Barlow for the Queen's Diamond Jubilee. The track, Sing, features musicians from across the Commonwealth, the Military Wives choir - and Prince Harry on tambourine. Speaking backstage at the Ivor Novello awards, with his statuette in hand, Lord Lloyd-Webber confirmed he would be playing the song at the Jubilee concert outside Buckingham Palace on 4 June. ""We just wanted to celebrate the one thing that the Queen's most proud of - the keeping together of the Commonwealth."" But his major TV appearance this summer will be on ITV talent show Superstar - which aims to fill the role of Jesus for an arena tour of hit musical Jesus Christ Superstar. The musical, with lyrics by Sir Tim Rice, was first performed in 1971. It has been translated into 11 languages and performed in 22 countries. The 2012 arena tour stars ex-Spice Girl Melanie Chisholm, comedian and musician Tim Minchin and Radio 1's Chris Moyles. Dawn French and Jason Donovan have been signed up as judges, with Britain's Got Talent judge Amanda Holden hosting the live heats. Lord Lloyd-Webber set the template for his TV star search with the BBC series How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria? He said: ""On Superstar we've got to have a guy with phenomenal charisma. He'll be playing opposite Tim Minchin as Judas, Chris Moyles as Herod, and Mel C as Mary."" It had always been Minchin's ambition to play Judas, he revealed. ""He's a wonderfully good singer, so it'll be a little bit of a different side of Tim Minchin we'll see."" And what did he think of the recent series of Britain's Got Talent? ""I thought it was brilliantly put together - and so well edited. Looking at it with my telly hat on, I'm pleased that we have the same director on the Superstar programmes."" Once the Superstar search is over, Lord Lloyd-Webber will take ""time off"" to write his next musical - his first since 2010's Love Never Dies. ""I'm pleased that I've found a subject that I want to write now,"" he admitted. That subject is a the life and death of Stephen Ward, the London osteopath who was linked to the Profumo scandal in the 1960s. Conservative War Minister John Profumo was forced to resign from the Cabinet in 1963 for lying to the House of Commons over his affair with Christine Keeler. His brief affair with Ms Keeler had begun after he was introduced to her by Ward at Lord Astor's Cliveden country estate in Berkshire in July 1961. Ward took an overdose of tablets and died three days after being found guilty of living on immoral earnings. ""It's not - as people will immediately say - a musical about the Profumo Affair and Christine Keeler,"" Lord Lloyd-Webber explained. ""It's about the life of this man - and how a man who was probably the most popular, most sought after, most urbane - a figure who you really wanted to meet if you were in London - ended up as a waxwork in the chamber of horrors in Blackpool. ""He was the fall guy for what happened in a whole series of events that spun out of control... but the more you look at the story the more it's quite clear that a lot of things that were alleged to have happened probably didn't happen."" He added: ""It's also very much about how both the press and media put pressure on these very young girls to say things that weren't necessarily true. ""It's an incredibly interesting subject for today, and it's right at that time when everything was changing, the old Britain was going and The Beatles were just happening."" 2012 marks the 40th anniversary of Lloyd Webber's musicals running consecutively in the West End. His shows include Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, Evita, Song & Dance, Cats, Starlight Express, The Phantom of the Opera and Aspects of Love. ""The shows are like children - I don't have a favourite,"" he said. One of the most rewarding moments of his career, he added, was winning a Tony for Sunset Boulevard on Broadway. ""In many ways Sunset is the most sophisticated of all the shows, and it's fantastic we got recognised for that. It was an amazing performance with Glenn Close. It's a real grown-up musical."" Now Lord Lloyd-Webber has to find a home for another award, his 14th Ivor Novello statuette. Reporters at the event were keen to know whether the musical maestro would put it on the mantelpiece - or even in the toilet. His diplomatic answer? ""It'll go with the others. They're not exactly in the toilet, but they're not far away.""",Andrew Lloyd Webber on his search for Jesus and why his next musical will be linked to the events of the Profumo scandal.
"By Rachel FoleyEntertainment reporter Now, 25 years after its release, most of the original cast of Four Weddings and a Funeral have reunited for a short sequel to be shown during Friday's Comic Relief telethon on BBC One. What can we expect from the sequel? Four Weddings writer - and Comic Relief co-founder - Richard Curtis has written the new instalment, called One Red Nose Day and a Wedding. As well as Grant, actors including Andie MacDowell, Rowan Atkinson, Dame Kristin Scott Thomas, James Fleet and John Hannah have reprised their roles for charity. We also know there are special guests including Alicia Vikander and Susanna Reid. The original film followed a group of friends as they attended - you guessed it - four weddings and a funeral. Curtis has revealed some details of the sequel's plot. He says: ""It's 25 years since the film came out, and I was never going to follow it up. ""And then it did just occur to us that the characters in the movie would have children so they might be back in the wedding phase again. ""Without revealing too much, we have another wedding and a reception after the wedding, and all the characters came back."" At the end of the original film, it was revealed that Charles (Grant) and Carrie (MacDowell) had a baby. Could that baby have grown up to be a character played by Lily James, who was pictured on set in December in a suspiciously bridal costume? We will find out at some point during Comic Relief, which kicks off at 19:00 GMT. Two Oscar nominations and a hit song (and THAT dress) Four Weddings was a huge hit when it was released in 1994, and Grant's portrayal of bumbling bachelor Charles made him an instant international star. Before Four Weddings, the actor's career was going nowhere and he had taken work teaching French actress Juliette Binoche how to do an English accent, being paid cash in hand. Upon the film's release, he wasn't the only one who achieved sudden stardom - girlfriend Liz Hurley dominated the tabloid front pages after turning up to the UK premiere in what became known in the press simply as ""THAT dress"". In the years following Four Weddings, Grant went on to play similarly tongue-tied romantic leads in a string of British and Hollywood films, including Curtis's own Notting Hill and Love Actually. Four Weddings made £187m at box offices worldwide, was nominated for best picture and best screenplay at the Oscars, and the film's theme song - Wet Wet Wet's Love Is All Around - spent 15 weeks at the top of the UK charts. Why did we fall in love with Four Weddings? Clarisse Loughrey, culture reporter for The Independent, says its very Britishness was one of the keys to its success. ""There's a touch of national pride to it, I think,"" she says. ""The rom-com genre is otherwise completely dominated by Hollywood, but Four Weddings and a Funeral is a film that feels British to its very core - all the way from Hugh Grant's floppy hair to the delightfully profusive swearing."" Sarah O'Connell, film critic and host of YouTube talk show The Sarah O'Connell Show, points out that an early US release helped boost its popularity in the UK: ""Four Weddings was actually released in the US two months before its UK debut, by which time, it had already garnered critical acclaim. ""Early word of mouth also helped generate a buzz to ensure that everyone wanted to see it, in the same way that Mamma Mia and The Greatest Showman more recently became event movies."" But Four Weddings didn't win over every viewer. Curtis recounts how, at the premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in Salt Lake City, Utah, the town council walked out due to the swearing in the opening sequence. Dr Louis Bayman, lecturer in film studies at the University of Southampton, says it's the film's portrayal of romance that gives it such lasting appeal. ""I think what is most notable about the film is how it manages to register change while remaining a very traditional love story - classic, even. ""The characters swear, have modern jobs and lifestyles, are very recognisably '90s', there are important gay roles, and yet it also harks back to notions of true love which strike people as timeless."" O'Connell says the film's single-handedly raised the profile of British films: ""Four Weddings and a Funeral proved that British romantic comedies, even relatively low budget ones, could become international hits."" She continues: ""For a long time after its release, many romantic comedies had ambitions to be, and marketed themselves as, the next Four Weddings. ""Twenty-five years later, the iconic film is still celebrated and remembered fondly, and rightly so. "" Five things you might not know about Four Weddings and a Funeral Some characters won't be returning Not all the original cast will be in the sequel. Charlotte Coleman, who played Scarlett, died in 2001 after an asthma attack, aged just 33. It's also unlikely that Simon Callow will return, as his character Gareth died in the last film - leading to the funeral of the title. Dr Bayman says it's a shame Gareth didn't make it through the first film. He says: ""Simon Callow deserves mention for his powerhouse performance and for establishing the presence of gay romance alongside straight ones. ""However, the fact that his is the one character who dies, rather than ties the knot and lives happily ever after, was criticised at the time and seems now to suggest the limitations on gay representation even then."" There's another Four Weddings spin-off in the works The sequel is not the first time Curtis has followed up one of his biggest successes. He wrote a short sequel to his 2003 hit Love Actually for Comic Relief 2017. It helped raise a lot of money for charity, but the responses were mixed. Many are excited to see what's become of the Four Weddings characters 25 years on, and it will surely also help raise lots of money. But this isn't, to misquote Star Wars, the sequel everyone is looking for. Hulu is also developing a TV mini-series based on the film with actress and producer Mindy Kaling. Game of Thrones and former Hollyoaks alumni Nathalie Emmanuel is slated to star. Loughrey says: ""To be honest, I'm more interested in what Mindy Kaling's television series based on the film might achieve. ""The Mindy Project felt modern and relatable in its romantic relationships, and I'd be interested in seeing this same concept approached from a female perspective.""

"By Mark SavageBBC Music reporter Over the next week, every BBC local radio station in England and the Channel Islands is accepting nominations for a local artist (or venue) that changed the course of musical history. The winners will be honoured with a plaque on a building where they lived or a venue where they became famous. To be considered the nominee must be: The candidates will be submitted to The British Plaque Trust - and the 40 recipients will be unveiled on Friday, 9 June as part of BBC Music Day. Surprisingly few pop musicians have one - with a notable exception being David Bowie, who is honoured at the location of the photoshoot for The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust in London's West End. But who else deserves one? To get you thinking, here are five people and places that could benefit from a blue plaque. GEORGE MICHAEL'S SCHOOL IN HERTFORDSHIRE Long before he could grow that designer stubble, George Michael met Andrew Ridgeley at Bushey Meads school and pop history changed forever. Bonding over a love of music, the duo initially formed a five-piece band called The Executive, who played everything from ska to Beethoven's Fur Elise. Their friendship was vital in sustaining George through the whirlwind success of Wham! and eventually giving him the courage to go solo. PEAK CAVERN IN DERBYSHIRE Estimated to be more than 100 million years old, Peak Cavern is undoubtedly the oldest music venue in the UK. The natural limestone cavern has hosted gigs by the likes of Richard Hawley, Mystery Jets and The Vaccines, who all benefit from the site's remarkable acoustics. Fun fact: It used to be called The Devil's Arse (because of the flatulent sound caused by flood water draining from the cave) but received a more demure name in 1880, so Queen Victoria wouldn't be offended when she visited for a concert. FREDDIE MERCURY'S MARKET STALL While Queen were still a struggling young pop band, Freddie Mercury ran a stall in London's Kensington Market with drummer Roger Taylor. They sold clothes and bric-a-brac, as well as a thesis Freddie had written about Jimi Hendrix while attending Ealing College. The stall did well enough to fund the band in their early days - so much so that they kept it going after Queen released their first album. DELIA DERBYSHIRE'S CHILDHOOD HOME Delia Derbyshire is one of the earliest and most influential pioneers of electronic sound. Working in a time before synthesisers, samplers and multi-track tape recorders, the musician, assisted by her engineer Dick Mills, created not only the original Dr Who theme but countless other experimental and ground-breaking recordings. She was born in Coventry, but was evacuated to Preston, Lancashire, during World War Two. A blue plaque at either of her childhood homes would be a fitting memorial. BEACHY HEAD IN EASTBOURNE Not the most rock'n'roll of locations, Beachy Head nonetheless deserves its place in music history. David Bowie filmed elements of the video for Ashes to Ashes there; and The Cure used it as the backdrop for both Just Like Heaven and Close To Me. Industrial noise terrorists Throbbing Gristle used it in the deeply-ironic cover for their album, 20 Jazz Funk Greats; and, most famously of all, it stars in the final scene of The Who's Quadrophenia, where the young Jimmy throws his scooter over the edge of those chalky cliffs. To make your suggestion for a musical blue plaque, you can contact your BBC local radio station via email, Twitter or Facebook; or email localmusiclegends@bbc.co.uk. You can also share suggestions on social media using #localmusiclegends. The British Plaque Trust criteria is to commemorate innovative, influential and successful people who have died - but any genre of music is permissible, and significant locations which have played a part in our musical heritage are also eligible. The initiative is not a vote - so the final decision on who or what the plaques commemorate, and where they are located, will not be based on the number of suggestions received. Nominations close at midnight on Sunday, 26 February. Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

"John Key said he would be ""greatly concerned"" if production on Peter Jackson's film was lost. Mr Key added the government was taking the unusual step of holding initial discussions with those involved in a move to break the deadlock on pay. Unions have urged a boycott until the contracts wrangle is resolved. Mr Key told New Zealand's TV One that The Hobbit should not be the target for the unions' demands for binding contracts for performers in the country's movie industry. The conservative premier said they were ""holding to ransom one particular producer and one particular film"". He added that the film industry is a lucrative earner for the country and a tool for marketing it as a tourist destination. In an open letter written last week, Lord of the Rings director Jackson accused Australia's acting union of using the dispute to move in on New Zealand's film industry. The Oscar winner said any shift of production base would lead to a ""long, dry big-budget movie drought in this country"". The two-part movie has yet to be given the go-ahead by Hollywood studios, but the Los Angeles Times has reported that a deal could be close to being sealed. Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy won 17 Oscars and earned billions of dollars at box offices worldwide.","A union dispute should not lead to filming of The Hobbit being driven out of New Zealand, the country's prime minister has said."
"By Tim MastersArts and entertainment correspondent ENO's 2015-16 programme includes six new productions and five revivals, with 50% of all tickets reduced in price. Announcing the new line-up, artistic director John Berry admitted the ENO faced ""difficult financial times"". The organisation was placed under special funding arrangements in February by Arts Council England. It was told to improve its business model over the next two years or face budget cuts. The 2015-2016 programme, unveiled on Wednesday, includes popular favourites such as The Barber of Seville, The Mikado, The Magic Flute and Madam Butterfly. Berry acknowledged that the new season had been reduced in size after cuts last year. ""We lost 30% of our arts council grant and there are a huge financial challenges across the whole of the arts and one has to cut our cloth accordingly. ""Maybe it's a smaller season, but in terms of artistic adventure it feels extremely exciting."" The new season at the London Coliseum opens with Shostakovich's Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk, conducted by the ENO's new music director Mark Wigglesworth. Artist Anish Kapoor will design a new production of Wagner's Tristan and Isolde, while Australian director Benedict Andrews - who oversaw Gillian Anderson's acclaimed performance in A Streetcar Named Desire at the Young Vic - will direct Puccini's La boheme. The new ticket pricing scheme will see 60,000 tickets available for £20 or under, with 100 seats at every show available at the lowest price of £12. Cressida Pollock, the ENO's interim chief executive, said it was vital that the company's work was accessible to the widest possible audience. ""We recognise that we must bring new audiences into the London Coliseum, and ensure they return time and time again by offering an experience like no other, at an affordable price."" The ENO has had a bumpy ride behind the scenes in 2015 coupled with a string of stage successes - including two wins at the Olivier Awards and 96% capacity audiences for the recent Sweeney Todd, starring Emma Thompson and Bryn Terfel. Both its chairman and executive director both stepped down within days of each other in January, and then in February the Arts Council dropped ENO from its national portfolio of organisations for 2015-18. It said it would review the ENO's finances over the next two years and ""set rigorous milestones"" for progress. Asked about the challenges ahead, Berry said his priority was to get back into the national portfolio and secure a third year of funding. ""Arts funding, even at its reduced level, is a spring-board for commercial relationships. It's not there to pay for the whole organisation - it can't. ""It's both an exciting and challenging time. I wish it was easier at times but we can't do everything every year."" He said the ENO had been ""a very tough company to run"" for three decades. ""In the end it has to be about the art and the work we are doing on the stage."" One potential issue between the Arts Council and ENO, according to BBC arts editor Will Gompertz, is whether the opera company needs a full-time orchestra and chorus. Berry said on Wednesday that the orchestra and chorus were ""vital to our artistic heritage and our artistic future"". An Arts Council spokesperson told the BBC: ""We did not direct the ENO on whether to have a permanent orchestra or chorus. Our funding agreement with the ENO is based on their board delivering against a clear business plan - it is for their board to decide how they make their financial arrangements work to this plan.""",English National Opera has announced it is cutting ticket prices for its new season as it attempts to secure its financial future.
"By Ian YoungsArts reporter, BBC News Moors Murderer Ian Brady, who killed five children in north-west England in the 1960s, tells a schoolboy his favourite film is Bambi. Peter Sutcliffe, the Yorkshire Ripper, who murdered 13 women in the 1970s and 80s, assures an infatuated woman he is no longer dangerous because he now ignores the voices in his head. Dennis Nilsen, who killed 15 predominantly homosexual men in his London flat and disposed of their bodies by boiling body parts in his kitchen, gives relationship advice to a confused Waitrose worker who is looking for a gay affair. This is an unholy trinity of the most evil men in modern Britain. The revelations - which range from the chilling to the surreal to the mundane - are contained in unpublished letters written from their cells to pen pals in the outside world, explains Taggart creator Glenn Chandler. Chandler has acquired correspondence from these serial murderers. They now form the basis for his play Killers. A dozen letters written by Ian Brady to a schoolboy and 15 from Nilsen to the shelf-stacker were bought from a dealer, Chandler says, while 150 from Sutcliffe to a woman who wanted to marry him came from an ""anonymous source"". ""Believe me, lots of women write to the Yorkshire Ripper and fall in love with him,"" Chandler says. ""The strangest people become fans of serial killers."" As the writer of Taggart, which ran for 27 years until 2010, Chandler has spent more time than most trying to get into the minds of murderers. In his new play, the three men are portrayed on stage at their writing desks. ""The exciting thing about the letters is the little mundane things about them, such as Ian Brady talking about his favourite film, which happens to be Bambi,"" Chandler says. ""And the avuncular advice that these serial killers give their fans on the outside. Ian Brady is advising his schoolboy correspondent to stick with school, and not follow a life of crime like he did, and become a mechanic or a chef and he picks him up on his handwriting. ""Dennis Nilsen likewise. One gets the impression the boy is writing to him saying, 'I'm very lonely I don't have any friends.' Denis Nilsen is writing saying, 'Look, you've got to go out and make friends.' ""He tells Denis Nilsen that he wants to go out and have a gay relationship. Denis Nilsen says, 'Remember, a gay relationship is a two-way thing. You must give and take.' Yet here's a guy who killed 15 of them and chopped up their bodies. ""So some of the ironies in the letters are absolutely fascinating."" There is ""a fantastic amount of insight"" into the psyches of the killers, Chandler suggests. Brady refuses to answer his young correspondent's questions about his crimes and shows no remorse, according to Chandler, who says Brady asks the boy: ""Why are you interested in me? ""Why aren't you interested in an American Air Force pilot who drops bombs on a village in Iraq? Is it because he kills with official permission and I don't kill with official permission? Is that what makes me so interesting?"" Chandler adds: ""He goes on about that but he won't talk about his crimes. ""The Yorkshire Ripper, on the other hand, he does. He says to his lady correspondent, 'I'm cured now. I still hear the voices telling me to do these bad things, but I know that they're bad and I don't listen to them any more. If I got out now I'd be all right, I'd be perfectly safe, I wouldn't hurt you.' ""He says, 'I know all the things I did were bad and I wish I could put the clock back and not do them.' You get the feeling that there's not a lot of sincerity there. 'The things I did were bad' is a bit of an understatement."" The trio are linked by a sense of self-importance that comes from the knowledge that they have a reputation as ""criminal celebrities"", Chandler believes. ""If you're Peter Sutcliffe and you get 50 letters a month from different women… He never had that when he was a lorry driver."" In Brady's recent mental health tribunal, he unsuccessfully argued for a return to prison from a secure hospital. It was his first public appearance since his trial in 1966 and was criticised for simply giving him the attention he craved. Won't a play in which they are centre stage feed their egos even more? ""I would respond to that by saying that for me, the most interesting aspect of the psychology is the people who are writing to the serial killers,"" Chandler says. ""The schoolboy, the guy who works in Waitrose as a shelf-filler, the woman who is in love with the Yorkshire Ripper. It's really the psychology of the writers and why they write reflected through the killers' letters that I think is the main focus of the play."" That is a little unconvincing given that it is the killers who are portrayed on stage, not their pen pals. Chandler says he only has the inmates' side of the correspondence. If the show is feeding the reputations of these ""criminal celebrities"", so have countless books and TV dramas. ""I think they get enough publicity without a Fringe production to be honest,"" Chandler says. Still, word about the play has reached Nilsen. Chandler says the killer contacted him through a third party after an early performance in Brighton. ""Someone had reported back to him and he said to me, 'Glenn, bear in mind I'm just a 68-year-old geezer and I accept that people will always want to write plays or books or articles about me.'"" Killers is at the Assembly Rooms, Edinburgh, from 1-25 August.","Letters sent by Britain's most notorious serial killers to schoolchildren, supermarket shelf-stackers and lonely women have been used by the creator of TV drama Taggart for a new play at the Edinburgh Fringe."
"The star needed surgery to insert a pin in his finger, following an off-set accident in early March. Producers initially said the injury would cause ""minimal"" delays, but that has now extended to several weeks. Around 200 crew have been temporarily stood down until filming resumes. It is not the first delay to the shoot, which is taking place on Australia's Gold Coast. Tropical cyclone Nathan disrupted second unit photography shortly after filming began in February. Subtitled Dead Men Tell No Tales, the fifth Pirates of the Caribbean film sees Depp reprise his role as the swashbuckling Captain Jack Sparrow. Javier Bardem plays Captain Brand, a villain described as ""a ghost bent on revenge"" who holds Sparrow responsible for the death of his brother. A spokesman for the film told the Hollywood Reporter that resumption of filming depended on Depp's recuperation. Filming continued on scenes without Depp after his departure on 10 March, but he is now required on set. 'Pinch point' According to the Sydney Morning Herald, ""about half of the film's estimated 400 crew were told last Thursday there would be no more work for at least two weeks"". Mal Tulloch, from entertainment trade union the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance, said his members were not concerned ""at this stage"" that the production would come to a halt. ""They've tried to keep it going in his absence... but they've reached the pinch point,"" he is quoted as saying. Although the production still has around 14 weeks of filming left to complete, Disney says the film is still on target to meet its scheduled release date, 7 July 2017.","Filming on the fifth Pirates of the Caribbean film has been delayed until 15 April, after Johnny Depp's hand injury was found to be more serious than first thought."
"By Mark SavageEntertainment reporter But one band is boycotting the nudity and sexual choreography. And that band is Little Mix. ""There's no need to do that kind of dancing,"" protests Jade Thirlwall. ""Obviously, sometimes we do do a bit of sexy dancing but it's more empowering."" ""Yeah, it's sassy,"" agrees her bandmate Perrie Edwards. ""Not gyrating on the floor thrusting our vaginas."" Sex may sell - but Little Mix prove modesty is marketable. The quartet have sold 7.5 million records in four years, even scoring a top 10 album in the US with the clattering R&B of their second record, Salute. But surely they must come under pressure to show skin and sing suggestively? ""Do you know what? I think it's different for girl bands,"" says Jesy Nelson. ""Fans can find it intimidating if you're being sexy. ""I think that's why, a lot of the time, girl bands haven't really worked - because it's too sexy and girls are like, 'mmm… no, I'm a bit worried you're going to steal my boyfriend off me'. I think that's why we have done quite well."" Perrie chips in: ""We're not about that anyway. We're in our own lane, we know what we stand for. We want to inspire people. ""If we're a bit sexy, we're a bit sexy, if we're not, we don't really care. We don't feel like we have to have really skimpy outfits. We do whatever the heck we want. "" Incredibly for a ""manufactured"" pop group, that statement contains a kernel of truth. Little Mix have just spent a year recording their third album - an aeon in the quick turnover world of girlbands - after they scrapped the first draft. ""We wrote 100 or 200 songs,"" says Jesy. ""We thought we had an album, and we sat down together as a group and we listened to them and we were like, 'They're very mismatched. It doesn't work together as an album.'"" Crucially, they lacked a killer single - a problem that became increasingly urgent as time went on. ""Without a single what are you going to do?"" asks Leigh-Anne Pinnock. ""We had so many deadlines we kept missing. We didn't want to get to a time where everyone forgot about us. It was really scary."" So the band set up writing camps in the hope of finding a lead track. ""We gave out all our concepts, lyric ideas, where we are in our lives, what we want to talk about,"" says Perrie. ""But then,"" Leigh-Anne says, ""Black Magic came and everything just fell into place."" The single, out this week, is an instant classic: Effervescent, 80s-inspired pop with more hooks than a butchers, it is directly inspired by Cyndi Lauper's Girls Just Want To Have Fun. ""When we got it we all cried,"" Jesy admits. The only sticking point for the band was their lack of involvement. ""We've always written all our singles,"" says Leigh-Anne. ""It's the first time we've been handed a single and asked 'do you want it?'"" ""But we just knew,"" adds Jade. ""You can't deny it's a hit song."" With the single selected, the rest of the album coalesced around a late-80s, early-90s sassy pop sound. They finally finished recording sessions last week. ""I'm not going to lie, we are very happy to see the back of it,"" laughs Jesy. X Factor foundation Little Mix were formed, somewhat reluctantly, after auditioning as solo artists for the 2011 series of X Factor. ""We got put together at boot camp,"" explains Perrie. ""They based it on our height, but it just so happened we all loved each other."" ""They literally could not have picked three better girls."" Luckily, they found their voices worked as a quartet, Jesy's tremulous vibrato complementing Perrie's three octave ad-libs, while Jade and Leigh-Anne took the lead lines. ""We've all got such different voices, but the first time we sang together we all went 'wow',"" says Leigh-Anne. ""We practice over and over,"" adds Perrie. ""Then we record it on our phones so that when we go to sleep we can listen to it in bed."" But things nearly fell apart three weeks into the X Factor live shows when the band were forced to change their name after it was discovered a charity was already using their chosen moniker, Rhythmix. ""We were so upset,"" says Perrie. ""We weren't really seen that much, anyway, on the show. Nobody knew who we were. So when we had to change our name we just thought, 'oh great we may as well just go home now.'"" Jesy adds: ""I can never imagine being Rhythmix now. It just doesn't feel like us at all. It feels a bit boyish."" ""And it sounds too much like the Eurythmics,"" laughs Jade. They went on to win the show - and remain the only band ever to do so. Their winner's single, a cover of Damien Rice's Cannonball, has been airbrushed from history. On their arena tour last year, they introduced its follow-up, Wings, as ""our very first record."" That song - a juddering, multi-layered girl power anthem - set the Little Mix template; while the lyrics, about overcoming bullies, spoke directly to their teenage fanbase, known as Mixers, who the girls have been careful to cultivate. They are all over social media, setting challenges, recording video messages and even, for the Black Magic promotional campaign, performing a series of illusions. ""We know how important it is, especially for our kind of fanbase,"" says Jade. ""It's important that they always feel special."" ""They love knowing what we're up to and they love feeling involved,"" adds Perrie. ""But we do it because we want to."" The band's online presence has helped them crack the rest of the world, too. While Take That and Girls Aloud struggled in the States, Little Mix were already a known quantity by the time they released a single in America, thanks to their presence on YouTube and Twitter. Perrie explains: ""It's really hard to find the balance between everyone in Japan or Australia and America. That's why social media is so powerful, because it helps."" Their popularity isn't just about marketing, though. Little Mix are the first girl group since the Spice Girls who have that un-fakeable air of camaraderie. The band finish each other's sentences, whisper secrets and happily digress into discussions about toilet seat etiquette and she-wees (""It'd be great when we're on the road on tour,"" says Jade. ""Instead of having to stop for a toilet break we could just do it out the window."") But there's a downside to their activity on social media. ""Back in the Spice Girls era, you never had to see those negative comments,"" says Jade. ""Anyone can say whatever they want."" As Zayn Malik's fiance, Perrie gets the bulk of the abuse, but Jesy has been left in tears by trolls criticising her weight. ""People just hide behind the computer,"" she says. ""They'd never say it to your face. If you went up to them and said, 'tell us what you said on Twitter to my face' they'd be like, 'I'm sorry'."" So if they really could practice Black Magic, who would they cast a spell on? ""I've got a good one,"" says Leigh-Anne. ""You know all the evil Daily Mail commenters? The disgusting people that sit there and spew out awful things about everyone? I would make them fart all the time. All the time, they would just fart."" ""I feel like you could have a better punishment than that,"" taunts Jesy. ""Make them have no fingers so they can't type."" Sensing the tone is shifting, Jade attempts to play peacemaker. ""I'd mix a potion to make everyone positive. No more negativity,"" she says. ""The ingredients would be the sound of laughter, a bit of kindness, a bit of compassion... And a lot of vodka."" Black Magic is out now on Sony Records","Click onto YouTube and you can see Beyonce writhing on a pole, Nicki Minaj shaking her ample derriere, and Miley Cyrus straddling a giant wrecking ball, naked as the day she was born."
"The inquiry is being headed by Ken MacQuarrie, the director of BBC Scotland. Clarkson was suspended from Top Gear last week following an alleged altercation with producer Oisin Tymon. Mr Tymon did not file a formal complaint and it is understood Clarkson reported the incident himself. The row was said to have occurred because no hot food was laid on for the presenter following a day's filming in North Yorkshire. Writing in his column in the Sun newspaper, Clarkson appeared to hint that he was close to quitting, calling himself a ""dinosaur"" and adding: ""These big imposing creatures have no place in a world which has moved on.""

Media watchdog Ofcom said it had received more than 100 complaints about Top Gear being replaced on BBC Two with a Red Arrows documentary on Sunday, 15 March. However, an Ofcom spokesman said it would take no action as it ""can only assess a breach of the broadcasting code if a show has actually aired"". Red Arrows: Inside the Bubble, was a repeat of a show from July last year and got 1.3 million viewers. When Top Gear last aired on 8 March in the same slot it got 5.1 million viewers. The critic AA Gill voiced his support for Clarkson in his Sunday Times column, calling the investigation into the row ""preposterous and ponderous"", and praised Clarkson as hard-working. Top Gear is one of the BBC's most popular and profitable TV shows, with an estimated global audience of 350 million. The remaining shows in the current series were pulled following the incident. A lawyer for Mr Tymon said his client ""intends to await the outcome of the BBC investigation and will make no comment until that investigation is complete"". No official date has been fixed for the investigation to present its findings. Mr MacQuarrie, the head of BBC Scotland, also carried out an investigation after Lord McAlpine was wrongly implicated in child sex abuse allegations by BBC Two's Newsnight in 2012.","The BBC's internal investigation into Top Gear host Jeremy Clarkson's suspension from the programme following a ""fracas"" with a producer has begun."
"Cowell has said he offered Dixon a judging slot on Britain's Got Talent based ""70-30 on the fact she was on Strictly and the fact I liked her"". He added there was ""unbelievable rivalry"" between the two talent shows. But speaking to Radio 5 live's Richard Bacon, Goodman said: ""If that is the case - shame on you, Simon."" It was announced earlier this month that Dixon was to join judging panellists Cowell, David Walliams and Amanda Holden on the ITV1 talent contest. Goodman, 68, added that he would never ""knock the opposition"" and he enjoyed Cowell's shows. ""I think it is spiteful and mean if that is the case that Simon said: 'I just want to be spiteful towards Strictly'. ""Because why would you want to do that? Why would you want to spoil millions of people's pleasures? It's not the right way to behave, so if that is the case - shame on you, Simon."" Bacon also asked the Strictly judge whether he thought his former colleague Arlene Phillips would return to the panel, now Dixon has left. ""I don't know. I've got a feeling if they asked her to come back, that she would,"" he said. ""I would be perfectly happy if Arlene was to return because I thought she did a great job while she was on it. ""I don't think the BBC got rid of her in a nice way actually. As far as I understand, she virtually didn't know about it until it was almost in the press. ""I think they could have handled the whole thing in a more diplomatic and nicer way."" Phillips, who was 66 at the time, was axed from Strictly in 2009 in favour of 33-year-old Dixon, leading to accusations of ageism at the BBC.","Strictly Come Dancing's Len Goodman has branded Britain's Got Talent boss Simon Cowell ""spiteful and mean"" for poaching Alesha Dixon from the BBC One show."
"In the essay, which she recites over ambient music from the Manchester band, Thunberg calls for ""civil disobedience"" and says ""it is time to rebel"". ""There are no grey areas when it comes to survival,"" she adds on the track, which was released overnight. Thunberg, 16, has become one of the leading voices in the climate debate. She rose to prominence last year when she began skipping school to take part in protests. The new track will not be a single in its own right - but will feature as the opening song on the band's album. This is in keeping with the band's previous records, all three of which have opened with an ambient instrumental track entitled The 1975. Thunberg's track will also take that title - but this will be the first album opener from the band to feature speech on top of the music. Notes on a Conditional Form was recorded at the same time as The 1975's last album, A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships, which was released in November last year. The album helped them win two Brit Awards earlier this year, further cementing their status as one of the biggest bands in the UK. The music industry is still a major contributor to climate change. A report in the scientific journal The Conversation earlier this year suggested that, in the US alone, its greenhouse gas equivalents (GHGs) - a way of measuring emissions - has almost doubled since 1977. The 1975 are currently on a world tour, and will play gigs in Italy, Korea, Romania, Singapore, Ukraine, Dubai and Australia in the coming weeks. It is likely they will fly to many of those countries, despite air travel being a significant contributor to climate change. Thunberg took a 32-hour train journey to speak at the World Economic Forum in Davos earlier this year, in order to avoid flying. On the new track, Thunberg can be heard telling listeners: ""We are right now at the beginning of a climate and ecological crisis. And we need to call it what it is: an emergency."" ""Today we use about 100 million barrels of oil every single day,"" she continues. ""There are no politics to change that. There are no rules to keep that oil in the ground, so we can no longer save the world by playing by the rules, because the rules have to be changed, everything needs to change, and it has to start today."" The essay is direct in its message but short on actual practical measures which she thinks should be put in place. She does, however, say: ""The main solution is so simple that even a small child can understand it. We have to stop our emissions of greenhouse gasses."" Thunberg became famous last year after she protested every day for three weeks during school hours by sitting outside the Riksdag (the Swedish parliament), calling on the government to reduce carbon emissions in line with the Paris Climate Agreement. She gradually built up an online following and encouraged young people around the world to take part in protests. Thunberg has since become a prominent political figure and has spoken at the European Parliament in Strasbourg and the UN's Katowice Climate Change Conference.","Swedish activist Greta Thunberg has recorded an essay about climate change for The 1975's new album, Notes on a Conditional Form."

""He's made Bond such an iconic character, no-one thought Bond would still be this important and get this much attraction."" While many fans are pleased to see Daniel Craig back as Bond, some people think it's time to give another actor a go. Prem Mohanty wrote on Twitter: ""Seriously Daniel Craig is too old to play James Bond, 4 movies was quite enough."" Idris Elba had been widely tipped in the past to take over, but that's not going to happen - yet, at least. A Twitter user named Hood Economist wrote: ""Daniel Craig returning as Bond? Thoroughly enjoyed his Bond films but I was ready for @idriselba tbh!"" What we know about the next film so far Trump v Bond? Bond writers Neal Purvis and Robert Wade suggested US President Donald Trump could influence the next Bond film in an interview with The Telegraph in February.

""Each time, you've got to say something about Bond's place in the world, which is Britain's place in the world. ""But things are moving so quickly now, that becomes tricky.

"Its star, Timothy Spall, is up against The Imitation Game's Benedict Cumberbatch in the best actor and best British actor categories. Michael Keaton and Edward Norton, who star in black comedy Birdman, also received nods for their performances. The dark satire has been nominated for six awards including best film. The movie, which tells the story of a former superhero actor attempting a Broadway comeback, led the field at the recent Golden Globe nominations. Emma Stone received a nod for best supporting actress in director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's film. Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones have been recognised for their roles in the Stephen Hawking drama The Theory of Everything. Redmayne plays the famous physicist while Jones plays his first wife, Jane Wilde, on whose book the screenplay is based. It has received five nominations along with The Imitation Game, coming-of-age drama Boyhood, Wes Anderson's comedy The Grand Budapest Hotel and science fiction film Under The Skin, starring Scarlett Johansson. The actress, who stars in the British independent production as an alien serial killer, has been nominated for best actress alongside Oscar-winner Marion Cotillard, Essie Davis and Julianne Moore. Moore is nominated twice for playing a woman with early onset Alzheimer's in Still Alice, and for her work in David Cronenberg's Maps to the Stars. Nightcrawler, which stars Jake Gyllenhaal as an ambulance-chasing freelance cameraman, has four nominations including best film and best actor. The awards will be announced at a London ceremony on 18 January. A full list of this year's nominations can be found on the Critics' Circle website. Elsewhere, the US Critics Choice film nominations have been announced with Birdman leading the flock again with 13 nods including best picture and best director. But it was the darkly whimsical The Grand Budapest Hotel that surprised with 11 nominations including two for actor Ralph Fiennes in the best actor and best actor in a comedy categories. Cumberbatch and Redmayne were also recognised for their performances, leading to further speculation both will receive Oscar nominations next month.

"""You really got me!"" read the headline of the Daily Mail's five star review by Quentin Letts. ""After an indifferent year for new musical shows in London, here is a belter,"" he said. The show, written by Joe Penhall, features many Kinks classics and is named after their 1966 hit single. It is running at the Hampstead Theatre. ""This show is far better than a mere tribute evening, though it includes lots of Kinks hits. It gives you a strong sense of period - some terrific short hemlines on the girls - yet also well-drawn characters that evolve with the band,"" Letts continued. The Telegraph's Charles Spencer also awarded five stars at Thursday's opening, noting the show had ""the whole audience up on its feet and in state of blissful euphoria by the end"". He said director Edward Hall ""marvellously nails the humour and the pathos of the piece"" and praised Miriam Buether's set design featuring scores of speaker cabinets. ""It is an irresistibly enjoyable and touching night, and anyone who loves pop music at its greatest would be mad to miss it,"" Spencer concluded. ""The songs joyously reach out to the audience, even as they are shown to be rooted in a wider, difficult and daft world of class, family, professional struggle and private agony,"" said Nick Hasted in his four-star review for The Arts Desk. ""In The Kinks' 50th Anniversary year, their spirit could hardly be better revived."" Also awarding four stars, the Evening Standard's Henry Hitchings praised the lead performances. ""John Dagleish is immense as [Ray] Davies, capturing his quirkiness and charisma. His guitarist brother Dave is given an exciting wildness by George Maguire. ""And if at the end we're pretty much coerced into a dancing ovation, some of the show's best moments are in fact its more melancholy and reflective ones. Sunny Afternoon illustrates the brilliance of The Kinks and the incisive songwriting of Davies, and it's surely destined for the West End."" The Stage's Mark Shenton likened Sunny Afternoon to a British version of Jersey Boys, which tells the story of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons. ""Though Joe Penhall's script may not be as sharp or well-defined as that of Jersey Boys, it is generously full of heart and especially the soul that propelled The Kinks' music. ""The result is dramatically a bit rough, ready and ragged but it lends the evening a useful whiff of improvisation and spontaneity."" Sunny Afternoon is at Hampstead Theatre until 24 May.","Sunny Afternoon, a new musical about the early career of pop band The Kinks, has impressed critics amid predictions of a West End transfer."
"It spells out fundamental questions about the broadcaster's future, which it will debate before renewing the BBC's Royal Charter. These are some of the key passages from the 86-page document. 1) Is the BBC failing audiences? ""The BBC remains highly valued and well-used by the majority of people within the UK. But there are variations across different groups and there are particular challenges in reaching black, Asian and minority ethnic audiences and in meeting the needs of younger age groups who increasingly access content online, rather than via the traditional platforms of television and radio. ""There is also variation across the nations and regions of the UK. Charter Review will consider the extent to which the BBC is meeting the needs of these different segments of the domestic audience."" 2) Should the BBC make shows like Strictly? ""The BBC provides a wide range of content across platforms which would either not be provided or under-provided by the wider market. For example, distinctive natural history series such as Planet Earth, in-depth classical music and arts programming on Radio 3, innovative documentary series such as a History of the World in 100 Objects for Radio 4, and quality science programming such as Horizon. ""However, it also provides a range of programming which is arguably less distinctive from the content that its commercial competitors provide. Concerns have been raised that the BBC behaves in an overly commercial way, encroaching on TV genres and formats that could be served well by its commercial competitors. ""This does not mean that the BBC should not be entertaining; it is about the BBC providing distinctive programming across all genre types. For example, the BBC acquired the format for The Voice. This was a singing talent show developed overseas, bought by the BBC at a reported cost of around £20 million and similar to ITV's X-Factor. This is in contrast to Strictly Come Dancing which was developed by the BBC in-house and then sold abroad. ""Similarly, questions have been raised about whether content carried on the BBC's website is sufficiently distinctive from content that can and is being developed and delivered by others."" 3) How should we pay for the BBC? ""There is a range of options for reforming funding of the BBC,"" the Green Paper observes, but ""no funding option is perfect and all involve trade-offs"". It goes on to list the alternatives, including ones that have already been discounted. 4) Could licence fee income be shared? ""Should some funding be made available to other providers to deliver public service content?"" asks the Green Paper. In other words, should some of the BBC's income be given to other broadcasters who wish to make their own public service programmes - such as children's television, where ""the BBC has a near monopoly"". ""This money could still be available to the BBC to compete for, or could be solely for other providers,"" the document says. 5) Should the BBC have a set of core values? Noting that the BBC has no ""codified set of values"", the Green paper asks whether such a statement of goals would be beneficial. ""The last Charter period has proved to be one of the most tumultuous in the Corporation's history, and numerous issues have arisen which placed the BBC's people and working practices under a great deal of scrutiny,"" it says. ""The BBC is a public broadcasting organisation, and it is right that its values should reflect the views of the public. This Charter Review presents the opportunity to consult on what a potential set of values might be."" A list of potential values is suggested in the document: 6) How should the BBC be regulated? Over the last 10 years, several headline-making failures - from ""excessive severance payments"" to a ""cancelled report on Jimmy Savile"" - have called into question the BBC's governance. With that in mind, should the BBC Trust be scrapped or reformed? The government sets out three options.",The government has launched a consultation paper on the future of the BBC.
"Peters, who had Alzheimer's disease, joined the show as Jack in May 1980 and was last heard on air in July 2011. A storyline which told of his character's Alzheimer's helped the show to win the Mental Health Media Award in 2007. June Spencer, who played wife Peggy, paid tribute to a ""complete pro"". ""He loved acting - it was his life,"" she said. ""I picture him in the latter days in the green room with his stick and his cap, always very genial."" She added: ""He was very conscientious - he always turned in a good performance no matter what we were doing."" She said Peters, who took over a part originally played by Philip Garston-Jones, was ""very active, all the time, whether it was for charity or professionally"", and produced amateur dramatic shows, was a country dance caller and a drummer. 'Enormous skill' In 2011, the Archers team visited Peters at his home, near Northampton, to record what would be his final scenes. ""His memory was failing but he could still turn in a good performance,"" said Spencer. ""He read it perfectly. We worked together just as we'd always done, up to the last."" Peters, who died on Saturday afternoon, had previously appeared in the Archers playing characters including Welsh farmhand ""with a past"" Len Thomas, in 1953, and Rev David Latimer, from 1968 to 1973. His character Jack Woolley, who was born in Birmingham in 1919, was previously married to Valerie, who he divorced in 1974, and had a loyal chauffeur, Higgs, and a Staffordshire Bull Terrier, Captain. In 2009, the character moved into the Laurels care home, where he still lives. The Archers editor Vanessa Whitburn said that, with ""enormous skill"", Peters took the character of Jack Woolley ""from sharp, sometimes ruthless businessman, mellowing through the years into retirement and eventual dependence on wife Peggy, as Alzheimer's set in"". ""Only the best actors can fine tune those character arcs over many years and Arnold was the best,"" she added. After serving in the RAF during World War II, Peters worked at Northampton Repertory Theatre - now the Royal Theatre, Northampton - for five years. He performed in BBC Children's Hour productions and was also a member of the corporation's Drama Repertory Company in Birmingham. In the 1990s, he appeared as a grandfather in TV adverts for Werther's Original toffees","Archers actor Arnold Peters, who played businessman Jack Woolley in the Radio 4 soap, has died at the age of 87 at a care home in Northamptonshire."
"Ofcom said the state broadcaster's English language outlet had breached several broadcasting licence rules over editorial control of the channel. Press TV has also failed to pay a £100,000 fine imposed last year. The channel called the decision ""a clear example of censorship"". It will be removed from Sky on 20 January. The £100,000 fine was imposed last year after the network broadcast an interview with imprisoned Newsweek and Channel 4 journalist Maziar Bahari, which the Ofcom said had been conducted under duress. Ofcom said Press TV had ""indicated it is unwilling and unable to pay"". It was during the investigation into the Bahari interview that the media regulator formed the impression that editorial decisions on the channel were being controlled by the offices in Tehran, instead of the UK. Press TV was given the opportunity to respond and make the relevant amendments needed to comply with the broadcasting code, but ""failed to make the necessary application"", Ofcom said. In a statement issued to the BBC, Press TV's newsroom director Mr Hamid Emadi said: ""We asked Ofcom if Press TV Limited did not have control over the broadcast, why was it getting fined, if it did have control, why would the licence be revoked? ""Ofcom contradictions are nothing new for Press TV. The British government's tool to control the media has, on several occasions, changed its decisions regarding Press TV in its two-year campaign against the alternative news channel."" The statement also claimed that Ofcom, which it called ""the media arm of the Royal family"", had failed to respond to a letter sent by its Chief Executive earlier this month.

"Oprah With Meghan And Harry: A CBS Primetime Special has been described by the US television network as an ""intimate conversation"". The ""wide-ranging"" interview will be broadcast on 7 March. The news follows the announcement that the royal couple are expecting their second child. According to CBS, Meghan will be interviewed about ""stepping into life as a royal, marriage, motherhood"" and ""how she is handling life under intense public pressure"". She will then be joined by Prince Harry, and the couple will speak about their move to the United States last year and their future plans. The decision to speak publicly comes just over a year after the couple announced they had decided to ""step back"" from life as senior royals and work to become financially independent. They carried out their final formal royal duties last March. Winfrey is a personal friend of Meghan and attended the couple's wedding in 2018. It is not known whether Harry and Meghan informed the royal household about their plans to be interviewed. Buckingham Palace declined to comment. It is also not known which broadcaster, if any, will show the interview in the UK. 'Frantic speculation' Jonny Dymond, the BBC's royal correspondent, said there would now be ""three weeks of frantic speculation"" about the contents of the interview. ""We wait to see what it will be and what kind of secrets are revealed about the past two or three years,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Tuesday. Dymond described Winfrey as ""a very close acquaintance"" of the royal couple and that she had apparently been ""angling"" for the interview ""for some time"".

"Seven of the 20 presenters on 6.30pm regional TV bulletins will be cut, and some local radio shows will be axed. Inside Out will be replaced by a new investigative journalism programme, which will have six regional editions instead of the previous 11. The cuts are expected to save £25m by 2022, and follow news of job losses in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The BBC has previously said it must save £125m this year because of financial pressures resulting from the coronavirus pandemic. More than 150 roles are due to be lost in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, the corporation announced in June. The proposed cuts are on top of the 450 redundancies previously announced - and subsequently put on hold - by BBC News. How will BBC output change? The new TV show to replace the magazine programme Inside Out will feature a single 30-minute investigation per episode, and will be made in London, Newcastle, Leeds, Birmingham, Bristol and Norwich. That means weekly current affairs programmes will no longer be made in Plymouth, Southampton, Tunbridge Wells, Nottingham and Salford. Regional TV and online news teams will be merged, and there will no longer be an online editorial hub in Birmingham. In the 39 local radio stations, the ""simplified"" schedule that was introduced when the pandemic began in March will be made permanent. The stations previously often had different programme schedules, but each will now have three daytime shows with one presenter. Any shows with two hosts will go down to one. The 11 regional Sunday morning political programmes, which have been replaced during the coronavirus pandemic by a single show, will all return but will undergo a ""creative review"". Regional morning news bulletins, which were cut during the pandemic, will also return. Why is this being done? Helen Thomas, the director of BBC England, said the corporation's local and regional services were created more than 50 years ago, and ""have changed very little and need significant reinvention"". She said: ""That has meant taking some difficult decisions. ""We are in the age of the Facebook community group and the WhatsApp neighbourhood chat. We must adapt to better reflect how people live their lives, how they get their news and what content they want. ""We're going to modernise our offer to audiences in England by making digital a central part of everything we do. We'll take forward lessons from Covid-19 that will make us more agile and more in touch with communities while also ensuring we're as efficient as we can be. ""I'm confident we can evolve our local and regional services while improving our impact and better serving our audiences."" What has the reaction been? Michelle Stanistreet, general secretary of the National Union of Journalists, said: ""These are huge cuts which will inevitably have an impact on the BBC's ability to sustain the breadth and depth of news coverage throughout England which truly reflects the diversity of the nation."" Julian Knight MP, chairman of the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee, drew attention to a recent BBC statement which said it was ""strongly committed to local and regional journalism"". ""This decision is a strange way of demonstrating that commitment,"" he said, adding that it was ""at odds"" with a pledge to do more journalism outside the south-east. The announcement put the expectation of ""a licence-fee funded quality regional news service"" in ""some doubt"", he said. Labour's shadow minister for media, Chris Matheson, said: ""While not unexpected, these cuts are still very damaging and unwelcome."" The announcement comes two weeks after dozens of broadcasters from Stephen Fry to Sir Lenny Henry signed a letter asking the BBC not to cut its English regional current affairs programmes.

"Admissions will be fixed at 180 every half hour - 50 fewer people than the gallery is legally allowed to let in. ""We've looked hard at the problems caused by very popular exhibitions... and decided to take action,"" gallery director Nicholas Penny told The Times. Advance booking opens on Tuesday. In a statement, the gallery said it expected there to be ""unprecedented demand"" for tickets and advised patrons to book in advance. Its decision to reduce the number of admissions, it added, had been ""in response to visitors' comments regarding overcrowding in exhibitions"". Longer opening hours and the decision to open the exhibition on 1 January 2012 will add 20% to normal capacity, it said. ""The message from the National Gallery is to book early... and to come prepared,"" its statement reads. According to the gallery, Leonardo Da Vinci: Painter at the Court of Milan will bring together ""the largest ever number of Leonardo's rare surviving paintings"". Masterpiece The ""landmark"" exhibition, which includes works never shown in the UK before, runs from 9 November 2011 to 5 February 2012. Concentrating on da Vinci's career as a court painter in Milan in the 1480s and 1490s, it will display more than 60 paintings and drawings by the artist. These include his acknowledged masterpiece The Lady with an Ermine, the Belle Ferronniere and the National Gallery's own recently restored Virgin of the Rocks. A full-scale copy of his famous Last Supper, on loan from the Royal Academy, will also be included. But speculation that the exhibition might feature the Mona Lisa proved to be unfounded. The gallery's decision to limit numbers follows outbreaks of what one art critic termed ""gallery rage"" as visitors struggled to view works of art on display due to large crowds at various so-called ""blockbuster"" exhibitions. Messages on the Tate's online message board earlier this year suggested some visitors were left frustrated by crowding at the gallery's Gauguin exhibition. Although some contributors felt the numbers of people were to be expected for such a popular artist, one Gauguin fan wrote: ""Would have preferred the exhibition if it had been less busy. ""Almost impossible to see the pictures, and reflecting upon them was impossible in such a crowd. Had travelled from Edinburgh to see exhibition, will think twice about going to a London show again.""",London's National Gallery is to limit visitor numbers to a major exhibition of Leonardo da Vinci works in an attempt to prevent large crowds detracting from the viewing experience.
"By Annabel RackhamEntertainment reporter He has been credited for transforming Burberry through show-stopping catwalk collections that are available to buy straight off the runway. Bailey has also drawn on the brand's British heritage, championing the UK's biggest models and musicians at Fashion Week and drawing the world's biggest names to experience it all on the front row. As the Yorkshire-born designer announces his departure from the company, we look back at the legacy he's left. Who could have predicted that one paparazzi shot could threaten the reputation of a huge luxury label? That's what happened in 2002, when EastEnders actress Danniella Westbrook was photographed dressed head to toe in Burberry, with her daughter in a matching outfit. Fashion designer and retailer Alex Eagle tells the BBC that this was ""the pivotal moment when the perception of the brand needed to change"". Eagle says: ""The print had been too overexposed and that image shows it became synonymous with ostentatious luxury."" This came at a time when the brand had also become associated with the football world. Players' wives and girlfriends as well as fans famously donned the print during the 2002 World Cup. Burberry check also became ubiquitous with fake goods, meaning it had lost its exclusivity. Christopher Bailey helped change all that. He joined the company 16-and-a-half years ago as a design director, working his way up to chief creative officer in 2014. Between 2002 and the present day, share prices have risen 729%. Eagle says Bailey, who is just 46, has managed to convince the fashionistas that Burberry is again cutting edge, exclusive and the only place to be during Fashion Week. ""I think he's a genius - he's created our best British global brand, it's young, desirable and cool,"" she says. ""Burberry previously was synonymous with bad taste. Now it has an identity which feels very British and can be sold around the world."" Burberry's catwalk shows have been the most ""slick, luxurious and global"" of any British brand, she adds. Lucy Felton is a fashion journalist and blogger and agrees that Burberry's modern-day success is entirely down to Bailey's vision. ""So much of Burberry's DNA is about Bailey"", she tells the BBC. ""His shows are big, amazing, glamorous affairs, with Kate Moss or Cara Delevingne closing the show - he always has big fashion icons. ""The show is one of the highlights of fashion week. It takes place in Kensington Gardens and is so grand. Celebrities fill the front rows and it's such an event. ""It's got such an uplifting feeling after a few days of shows and it has such a fun charm about it - they hold some of the best shows and parties."" Felton also highlights another great factor Bailey brought to Burberry - the hottest music talent. ""Bailey's always supported British music too - he launched the careers of Jake Bugg and James Bay by having them play on his catwalks, which people don't know unless they're a fashion insider,"" she says. She adds that Burberry is also behind the phenomenon of the ""it"" bag - its Prorsum collection creates each season's most coveted possession, worn by celebrities and sold at a high price point to add to its desirability. ""His 'it' bag was a real turning point, he created the seasonal bag that everyone wanted."" It all started back in 2007 with the studded Knight bag, which was made as part of a limited run. It was a huge hit with celebrities, seen on stars like Cameron Diaz, Emma Watson and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. ""I remember the Knight bag being four figures at the time and that was a big deal, it would cost £15,000 now,"" Felton says. ""Most big fashion houses do premium pieces anyway and Burberry knew what they were doing by uplifting prices. ""People will pay big money for amazing and limited pieces - they want an exclusive with only 20 items made."" Bailey is also credited with creating ready-to-wear fashion, available to buy straight off the catwalk. ""He created catwalk to consumer and the ability to buy now,"" Eagle says. ""He avoided high street copies because he would exhibit his show and those items would be able to be bought in store there and then, rather than being in the store six months later. He was trying to be ahead of the copycat."" The Burberry tartan has even become popular again. The fashion house's 2014 Christmas film featured Romeo Beckham in a classic cashmere scarf, while Burberry trench coats are again being seen as classy and desirable. ""There's been a real fashion resurgence complimenting that side of things as well - the tartan is still an attractive part of the brand,"" Felton says. ""Romeo Beckham's ad also created a new generation of people wearing the scarf, showing it as a lovely British brand and this all feeds into its charm."" Eagle says Bailey has managed to ""go 360"" by bringing back the Burberry print in a chic way. ""He's made something that feels English and London by nailing that look of tailoring,"" she says. ""Bailey's now celebrating the check in the chic way, he's put touches of it in the Macintoshes and knitwear, whilst scarves feel preppy and quaint. ""He's going to be a very hard act to follow."" As far as its reputation was concerned, Burberry had found that by becoming too accessible, with low-priced accessories, the brand had become cheapened. This was arguably one of the biggest challenges the fashion house would face - by raising prices, it would lose a lot of shoppers. That's where Burberry Beauty comes in. Created in 2010, it's marketed as a luxury make-up brand and sold in high-end department stores but with prices that match competitors like YSL and Estee Lauder. ""Burberry Beauty has become a lot more popular over the last few years,"" Felton says. ""It's quite cult and has really gorgeous luxury packaging. It's tapping into the younger generation who can afford a lipstick but not a catwalk dress. ""It means you can fill your home with Burberry even if you can't afford a £10,000 bag.""

"Jones, currently starring opposite Vanessa Redgrave in Driving Miss Daisy - said he was ""plain gobsmacked"" as he accepted the award. The 80-year-old was presented with his Oscar on stage by Sir Ben Kingsley.

The honour formed part of the 3rd annual Governors Awards, which also saw chat show queen Oprah Winfrey and make-up artist Dick Smith receive honorary awards. Jones was due to receive his Oscar in person but decided he did not want to interrupt his run in the London play. Instead, he accepted it via video link. In Los Angeles, Winfrey received the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award for her charity work, including the Oprah Winfrey Foundation and a Leadership Academy for Girls, which opened in South Africa in 2007. Oprah, 57, credited producer Quincy Jones who spotted her on a talk show in Chicago and went on to cast her in The Color Purple - for which she won an Oscar nomination - saying he was ""the only reason I am here tonight"". ""I never imagined myself receiving an Oscar, certainly not for doing what I believe is a part of my calling, a part of my being."" Smith, known in the industry as ""the godfather of make-up"", was also given an honorary Oscar.

Opening the ceremony, Academy president Tom Sherak made only a passing reference to what has been a troubled week at the Academy, asking: ""How was your week?"" to a ripple of laughter. Earlier this week, Eddie Murphy stepped down as host from the 2012 Academy Awards ceremony, following the resignation of producer Brett Ratner. On Thursday, it was announced that Billy Crystal would replace Murphy, with Brian Grazer taking over as producer. Meanwhile, Oscar-winning actress Vanessa Redgrave was the subject of a tribute made by the Academy at an event in London - the first time such an event has taken place in Europe.

Fiennes, who directed Redgrave in his directorial debut Coriolanus, praised the screen star as ""one of the greatest actresses, inspiring to work with on so many levels"". Tom Sherak, Ampas president, added: ""Vanessa Redgrave's depth and range as an actress have earned her work the admiration of peers, critics and fans.

"The final film in the epic Star Wars trilogy had its debut screening in Hollywood, while the Cats premiere took place in New York. One Twitter user described Cats, which stars Idris Elba and Rebel Wilson, as ""bewildering... and magical"". Star Wars fans hailed The Rise of Skywalker as ""a terrific finale"". Plot details for Star Wars have been kept tightly under wraps but director JJ Abrams has said the trio's characters - Rey, Finn and Poe - will be reunited on-screen, after dividing in 2017's The Last Jedi. Heading the line-up at the Star Wars premiere were the film's young stars Daisy Ridley, who plays Rey, John Boyega, who is Finn, and Oscar Isaac, who plays Poe. Star Wars veterans Mark Hamill, who plays Luke Skywalker, and Harrison Ford, who plays Han Solo, were also there to bid farewell to the movies that launched their careers in a venue made up as a futuristic hangar filled with life-size X-wing starfighters. Anthony Daniels, who has played C-3PO in each of the main Star Wars movies, said the event felt ""quite bewildering"". ""In fact, it's such a big experience that I'm not sure I can quite cope with it. But I do feel proud to be here and proud to be part of it."" The Rise of Skywalker officially concludes the so-called ""Skywalker saga"" of films begun by George Lucas in 1977.

But the movie seemed to endear many early viewers, as the first reactions started to roll in on social media. Broadway star Alan Henry called the movie ""spectacular"". Variety's Caroline Framke was equally effusive, even if in a rather different way. Rebecca Rubin, also of Variety, feared for her future slumber after seeing the movie. Cats is released in the UK and US on 20 December and fans of the stage version will be eagerly waiting for cinema doors to open, no doubt buoyed by Monday night's intriguing reaction. The story, which was originally based on TS Eliot's Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats from 1939, is about deciding which of the cats will ascend to the Heaviside Layer - aka cat heaven. The director said earlier this year that the story had a deeper message too that makes it relevant to human life in 2019. ""At the centre of this incredibly entertaining, comedic, fantastical musical is a very timely story about the importance for inclusion and redemption,"" said Tom Hooper, who also adapted another classic musical, Les Miserables, for the big screen in 2012. As for Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker - released on 19 December both here and across the pond - Disney boss Bob Iger told AFP at the premiere that fans would get ""some kind of closure, some sense of satisfaction"" for their favourite characters. ""Star Wars is probably the most important, most valuable mythology of our time, of the modern time,"" he said. ""If you just consider the global base of fans that have worshipped this storytelling since 1977, over 40 years... tonight being a culmination of nine films is an incredibly important night."" Tim Richards, CEO of Vue International cinemas in the UK, told BBC News he was expecting ""one of the biggest weeks in years for cinema admissions"". ""Most of our screens in the UK and Ireland will be playing late night sessions between Wednesday 18th and Thursday 19th, starting at 00:01, with a few cinemas like Manchester Printworks and Westfield London staying open all night for subsequent screenings into Thursday morning,"" he said regarding Star Wars. And for Cats, Richards was also anticipating a good turnout: ""Tom Hooper's amazing Cats has had huge pre-sales and looks like it will also be a huge hit, replicating its success on stage. ""Overall it looks like it's going to be another record-breaking year for big screen entertainment."" Follow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

"By Mark SavageBBC music reporter Think about Lady Gaga diving off the roof of Houston's NRG stadium, or Katy Perry riding an animatronic lion, or Diana Ross soaring out of Arizona's Sun Devil Stadium, waving to fans through the open door of a helicopter. This year was a little different. Canadian R&B star The Weeknd was the interval act and, for the first time in the game's 55-year history, he was largely forced to perform from the stands, rather than the pitch, in compliance with strict coronavirus protocols. And his 12-minute show was ""watched"" by thousands of cardboard cut-outs, who bulked out the 25,000 socially-distanced fans at Florida's Raymond James Stadium. But the 30-year-old made the most of the restrictions with a gimmick-free show that put the emphasis on his songs. The star, whose real name is Abel Tesfaye, performed the majority of his set in front of a set modelled on the city in Fritz Lang's Metropolis - all vertical layers and neon signs. As the opening bars of Starboy rang out, the cityscape parted to reveal the singer, bathed in light, performing surrounded by a choir of red-eyed automatons. Apart from a few Michael Jackson-inspired dance moves, he kept the focus on his vocals with a dramatic reworking of The Hills, before grabbing a camera and disappearing into a backstage maze of lights and mirrors. Jostled and buffeted by two dozen dancers in full facial bandages, he performed a dizzying version Can't Feel My Face, before emerging back into the stadium for a firework-assisted version of I Feel It Coming. The action moved onto the playing field for the finale - a medley of House of Balloons and Blinding Lights - sung directly to the camera, without the usual requirement for stunts, guest stars or marching band interludes. Tesfaye, who spent $7m (£5m) of his own money on the production, clearly felt it was best to let the music speak for itself. He even lined up a greatest hits album to coincide with the Super Bowl, which is traditionally the most-watched event of the year on US television. (Last year's half-time show, starring Shakira and Jennifer Lopez was watched by 103 million viewers, more than the 99.9 million who tuned in for the game itself.) Before Sunday night, there was a feeling that The Weeknd's dark-hued R&B could be an uncomfortable fit for a show that normally requires uplifting, crowd-pleasing anthems like Prince's Purple Rain or Madonna's Like A Prayer. But Tesfaye wisely built the set around his more optimistic songs - including Save Your Tears and Earned It - while the soaring melody of Blinding Lights was a suitably euphoric closer. In other words, he pulled it off, proving how badly The Grammys dropped the ball by snubbing him in this year's nominations. Which raises the question of how his set would have looked in a normal year. The chances are, it would have been a lot more elaborate. Speaking at a press conference before Sunday night's show, the singer spoke in awed tones of the aforementioned Ross-o-copter. ""I wish I could have done that, I wish I'd thought of it,"" he said. ""Although I don't think I have enough money to do it, to be honest."" What did celeb fans think? It's fair to say The Weeknd's performance went down a storm on social media with his fellow celebrities. Drake, who also hails from Toronto, Ontario, described the show as ""a big moment for the city"" on his Instagram story, while Dionne Warwick, everyone's favourite octogenarian on Twitter, wrote that she ""loved the set and pyros"". Country star Keith Urban was equally impressed, particularly with the staging., and actor Timothée Chalamet captioned a clip on his Instagram story: ""Legend! Legend!"" The Roots' Questlove was among those pointing out a throwback to Michael Jackson's Super Bowl performance in 1993. And there was also plenty of reaction to the moment when the star was preparing to sing his 2018 hit Can't Feel My Face, as he pretended to rush to get into place for the start of the track. It was quickly turned into a meme, accompanied by various tongue-in-cheek captions. Which songs did he play? Why were the dancers wearing bandages? The campaign for The Weeknd's recent album, After Hours, has revolved around a bloodied and bandaged character ""having a really bad night"". The story started with the video for Heartless. Inspired by Hunter S Thompson's Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas, it saw the star staggering around the casinos and fountains of Sin City, drinking to excess and licking a hallucinogenic toad before attempting to flee. The video for Blinding Lights picked up the narrative, with the singer drunkenly swerving through the deserted city, while flashing back to an incident in a nightclub that left him with blood pouring down his face. Over subsequent TV appearances and music videos, the visuals grew more and more gory. Tesfaye was decapitated in the video for In Your Eyes; while in Too Late, his head was grafted onto another person's body. Then, in last month's Save Your Tears, his facial bandages were unpeeled to reveal heavily-exaggerated facial prosthetics. Everyone else in the video wore masks and bandages - a theme Tesfaye carried over to the Super Bowl performance. Speaking to Variety last week, the singer explained the inspiration for the year-long storyline. ""The significance of the entire head bandages is reflecting on the absurd culture of Hollywood celebrity and people manipulating themselves for superficial reasons to please and be validated,"" he said. ""It's all a progression and we watch The Character's storyline hit heightened levels of danger and absurdity as his tale goes on."" Who else played at this year's Super Bowl? Dressed in a pink-and-black cheerleader outfit, Miley Cyrus kicked off the official pre-game show with a cover of Toni Basil's Oh Mickey. ""This is my first show in about a year,"" the star told the audience, which comprised more than 7,000 vaccinated healthcare workers, ""and I couldn't imagine a better way to do this. ""We are so appreciative of you and all your diligence. And for that, we're going to rock hard!"" Her raucous set mixed hits like We Can't Stop, Nothing Breaks Like A Heart and Prisoner with classic party tracks like Dolly Parton's Jolene and Blondie's Heart Of Glass. She even invited out 80s rockers Joan Jett and Billy Idol - both of whom appear on her recent album Plastic Hearts - for a series of duets. Cyrus also sang her 2009 hit Party in the USA, giving a shout-out to fellow pop star Britney Spears during the performance: ""We love Britney!"" She later fought back tears as she performed her 2018 hit Wrecking Ball, telling the audience: ""Singing that song, Wrecking Ball, about feeling completely broken and shattered… everyone's suffering is different, even everyone's threshold of pain. ""I wear a lot of glitter and I wear a lot of armour, and I also wear my heart on my sleeve, and it gets broken a lot."" Ahead of kick-off, 22-year-old poet Amanda Gorman - who won rave reviews for her reading at President Joe Biden's inauguration - recited another original poem. Chorus Of The Captains celebrated war veteran James Martin, teacher Trimaine Davis, and nurse manager Suzie Dorner - who were selected by the NFL as ""honorary captains"" for this year's game. ""While we honour them today, it is they every day who honour us,"" said Gorman's poem, which detailed their efforts to help at-risk children and vulnerable patients. R&B singer H.E.R. added a pyrotechnic guitar solo to her rendition of America the Beautiful, while the national anthem was performed as a duet between Eric Church and Jazmine Sullivan.

"The memoirs were set to give details about the 54-year-old's life growing up in Manchester and his relationship with former songwriting partner Johnny Marr. But a statement on his fan website said there had been a ""last minute content disagreement"" with its publisher. A Penguin Books spokeswoman said there would be no comment on the issue. ""Although Morrissey's autobiography was set to be available throughout the UK on September 16th, a last-minute content disagreement between Penguin Books and Morrissey has caused the venture to collapse,"" the statement said. ""No review copies were printed and Morrissey is now in search of a new publisher."" It is the latest setback for the singer, who suffered a series of what he referred to as ""medical mishaps"" which led to him cancelling his US tour earlier this year. He was also forced to cancel part of his South American tour in July due, he said, to a ""lack of funding"".","Former Smiths frontman Morrissey has halted plans to release his autobiography, three days before it was due to be published."
"The 37-year-old will star in William Shakespeare's classic tragedy at the Barbican Theatre in London from August to October 2015. Lyndsey Turner will direct the play for Sonia Friedman Productions. Friedman said she was ""thrilled"" to be producing the show, describing its star as ""one of the most gifted and exciting actors of his generation"". Best known for his role in BBC One's updated Sherlock Holmes series, Cumberbatch was recently seen in 12 Years a Slave and heard in The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug. 'Right age' He was last seen on stage in the National Theatre's 2011 production of Frankenstein, directed by Danny Boyle, in which he shared the roles of Frankenstein and his Monster with Jonny Lee Miller. Turner was widely praised for her direction of Lucy Kirkwood's play Chimerica, while her revival of Sophie Treadwell's 1928 play Machinal recently ended an acclaimed run on Broadway. Booking details for the 12-week run will be announced in May. Cumberbatch revealed last year he would be playing Shakespeare's Danish prince ""sometime in autumn on the London stage"". ""It's a role I've been interested in for a long time,"" he told the Daily Telegraph in 2012. ""I don't know if there is such a thing as a right age to play the part, but 36 or 37 seems appropriate to me.""",Sherlock and Star Trek actor Benedict Cumberbatch is to play Hamlet on stage next year.
"By Ian YoungsEntertainment reporter Kay appeared at the We Are Manchester show on Saturday alongside other local heroes including Noel Gallagher. More than 14,000 fans were there, four months after a bomb killed 22 people. ""The victims will never ever be forgotten, but we've got to move forward with love and not hate, and that's how we win,"" Kay told the crowd. Kay worked as a steward at the venue in the 1990s before going on to perform there more than 40 times. ""There's been a lot of joy in this room over the years, including the night of 22 May, right up until the terrorist attack,"" he said - and the crowd booed at the mention of the attack. ""These last four months have been incredibly painful,"" Kay continued. ""Horrendous is putting it mildly. But that's why you're here - because we can't let terrorists win. ""And I know the memories of that night will stay with us for a very long time but we've got to remember the good times and let them outweigh the bad."" Kay then introduced Gallagher, and the former Oasis star performed a string of favourites including Don't Look Back In Anger. The song took on special significance in the wake of the bombing after a crowd started spontaneously singing it at a memorial. ""It's become some sort of anthem for defiance,"" Gallagher said. ""And every time you sing, we win."" As well as defiance, the mood at the event had a mixture of pride, catharsis, pure enjoyment - and, for some, trepidation. Among the crowd were Paul Woodhouse and his son, from Edinburgh, who were at the Ariana Grande concert that was attacked on 22 May. He said: ""Some of us that were there first time were there [at the reopening] to face a fear. ""Not so much of going to a concert, but of going back to the same place. It's still a bit raw. In time, yes, I think it will have helped, coming back to the same place."" The atmosphere inside the concert was ""quite positive"", he added. ""We found everybody was quite cheerful with everybody. Quite uplifting. You knew everybody was standing together."" Adrian Thorpe, who was in the arena foyer when the bomb went off, said returning with his daughter and partner was initially ""nerve-wracking"". He said: ""It was emotional returning but it's turned out a happy evening. Last time we were here it was a sad time but it's been a joyous evening. ""She's enjoyed it and that's all that matters now. The kids can put a smile back on their faces again."" The foyer area was also reopened on Saturday, but it now contains a row of airport-style body scanners and brightly-coloured temporary wall coverings with slogans such as ""We are entertainment"", ""We are love"" and ""We are stronger"". Also in the crowd was Pep Guardiola, manager of Manchester City FC, whose wife and daughters were at the Ariana Grande gig. He told BBC News: ""It's good to come back to normality and see that life is going on and remember the families that suffered."" There was tight security at the venue, with backpacks banned and armed police patrolling both the exterior and the inside concourse. The night started with a tribute to the bomb victims from Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham, who read the names of the 22 people who were killed by Salman Abedi. The something-for-everyone bill included 1980s pop star Rick Astley - who was wearing a shirt bearing the Manchester bee emblem - plus Pixie Lott, ex-Girls Aloud member Nadine Coyle, grime MC Bugzy Malone and Stockport band Blossoms. Manchester band Courteeners summed up how the sense of pride in the city has been renewed since the attack when singer Liam Fray declared during their first song: ""Manchester, centre of the universe."" The concert was hosted by comedian Russell Kane. When a photographer came on stage to take a picture of the crowd, Kane told them: ""Let's show the world what defiance, happiness, positivity and strength look like.""

"Amol RajanMedia editor@amolrajanon Twitter Indeed, Eton and Oxford seems to be the spirit and mixer of choice for the British public. Yet look beyond Number 10 to the other great offices of state and you see a very different story: among the names Johnson, Javid, Raab and Patel you have three children of migrants, two of refugees, and family heritages that are Christian, Muslim, Jewish and Hindu. Class doesn't mean what it used to. No human society has existed without it in some measure. Whatever it does mean, Britain has made progress, but remains saturated in it. And many of the attempts to temper the worst effects of class privilege fail to grasp the subtle and pernicious ways in which inequality of opportunity endures. I have been researching this for a BBC documentary. Among the most influential academics in this arena is Sam Friedman at the London School of Economics. His work, The Class Ceiling: Why it Pays to be Privileged (written with Daniel Laurison) contains shocking data. Friedman finds that there is a class pay gap. Those from privileged backgrounds who get 2:2s are still more likely to get a top job than working-class students who went to the same universities and got a 1st. They will, on average, earn around £7,000 a year more. Those from upper middle-class origins will earn 16% more annually than those from working-class backgrounds - even in the same job. Among Oxbridge graduates, those from privileged backgrounds earn much more than those from working-class backgrounds. To be a woman or from an ethnic minority can be a predictor of disadvantage. Mix it with class and you have a much bigger disadvantage. ""Black British working-class women have average earnings in top jobs that are £20,000 less per year than those of privileged-origin white men,"" say Friedman and Laurison. Behavioural codes What is going on? Beyond the data, the central insight of the latest academic work is that people from poorer families are held back throughout their careers because they don't abide by the behavioural codes that dominate top professions. There exists atop our industries certain knowing practices - whether ""studied informality"" in the media, or knowledge of ski resorts among private equity - which working-class students are excluded from. They don't have the same cultural reference points or etiquette. They lack polish: that crucial quality of articulacy and presentational confidence that academics have noticed is vital in client-facing roles and which, despite his Falstaffian demeanour, Johnson personifies. This means that even if working-class kids get in, they often struggle to get on. The whole idea of ""access"" needs to be re-invented to appreciate that working-class graduates are likely to fall behind even once they've got their foot in the door. They are much less likely, for instance, to find a sponsor, a willing mentor who can open doors. Of course, getting the job in the first place is harder if you don't have the connections that private education can often give. Those who can rely on the Bank of Mum and Dad can afford to try different options or industries, or busk their way through an internship. Whereas those with families to support, and huge debts to pay, often take the first decent pay cheque. Just as ""access"" needs to be re-thought, so too that sainted victim of good intentions: ""diversity"". A diverse workforce may be morally desirable. But what does it mean? The diversity agenda has, quite understandably, been dominated by groups who are more visible: ethnic minorities or many with disabilities, for instance. These groups can be highly organised and persuasive. But across many professions, the poor have no collective voice. Class membership is much harder to define - and therefore to address. Meanwhile, since the 1960s, there has been a massive expansion of the higher education sector in Britain. But the growth in graduates has not been matched by a concomitant increase in the number of graduate jobs. This suggests the story we sell teenagers - that if they get a good degree from a top university they can become a high-flier - is at best incomplete, and at worst, downright deceitful. In the documentary, I get to know Amaan, a remarkable young man from a poor family in Birmingham. Amaan was a kickboxing world champion at the age of 17. He was the first in his family to go to university. He got a first in Economics from Nottingham. But Amaan lacks polish, and is crippled by a lack of self-confidence in City environments. He applies for jobs, does well in the early stages, and then - convinced he needs to be something he's not - goes to pieces in interviews. It's painful to watch. Accepting what he's been told about more education leading to better job prospects, Amaan is doing a Masters at Imperial. He keeps applying to the City - and not getting in. Today, this former world champion, with a first class degree, is staying with his uncle in Essex and destined shortly to be almost £90,000 in debt. He has, finally, got a job - at McDonald's. I know it sounds trite, but spending a year on this subject has made me re-evaluate the story I've told myself about my life. I am certainly no proletarian hero; my family, like yours perhaps, ascended the class ladder, so that while we were at times poor, by my school years we were lower middle-class. Classic immigrants, we had more moral than material wealth. Cambridge University was a passport to an exhilarating new world of social and economic capital. I've had several wonderful sponsors. I came from a stable, ordinary home with extraordinary ambition - something many of our poorest young people cannot lay claim to. And my ferociously disciplinarian parents - ok, Dad - told me to work harder than any colleague. I may not be posh, but I am exceptionally privileged. At various times, Raab, Patel and Javid have said the same. How I would love for Amaan to meet our new Chancellor. I have a feeling the latter would be up for it, and might get in touch. What is to be done? I set up a charity to transform the lives of inner city kids in London, by connecting them with elite professionals; but that is a local remedy, not a national plan. Alas, talk of ""social mobility"" remains a festival of platitudes. Behavioural codes within industries matter more than we thought, and often more than education. Too often, the poor have no lobby. Nearly 80 years after George Orwell - who as Eric Arthur Blair went to Eton but not university - first said it, Britain is still ""the most class-ridden country under the sun"". 'How to Break Into the Elite' is on BBC Two, Monday 29 July at 2100. If you're interested in issues such as these, you can follow me on Twitter or Facebook; and subscribe to The Media Show podcast from BBC Radio 4.","Of all the peculiarities to accompany the ascension of Alexander Boris de Pfeffel - oh, you know the rest - none is more telling than the fact that he should raise to 20 the number of British Prime Ministers who attended a school just south of Slough set up in 1440 for the education of 70 poor boys."
"By Ian YoungsEntertainment reporter, BBC News Animation UK, a lobby group backed by prominent studios, has met Chancellor George Osborne to urge him to introduce tax breaks in next month's budget. They have told him the industry is at a ""critical tipping point"" and could disappear from the UK within years. They say foreign tax breaks and other factors make it cheaper to work abroad. Animation UK said their meeting with Mr Osborne was ""positive and productive"". It follows a warning from Wallace and Gromit animators Aardman, which said it was considering moving production overseas because it was too expensive in the UK. 'Important role' In France, government funds and tax breaks account for almost 20% of production budgets, while Irish tax relief is worth up to 28%. In Canada, tax credits and other public support accounted for 47% of budgets in 2009/10. A Treasury spokesman said the government recognised ""the important role that all businesses - including those in the animation sector - have in building a strong, sustainable and balanced economy"". The government has already taken steps to help businesses by lowering corporation tax and widening measures to stimulate investment, he said. Here, leading figures of the British animation industry explain why they believe it will be a struggle to ensure future children's favourites are made in the UK. Anne Wood, Ragdoll Productions Anne Wood co-created Teletubbies and Rosie and Jim. Her latest animations, The Adventures of Abney & Teal and Dipdap, made their debuts on CBeebies last year. Asked whether she would be able launch a production company if she was starting out today, she instantly replies: ""Couldn't do it. Wouldn't be viable. ""When I started, I was one of the first independent companies and we made for Channel 4. You got your full production costs plus a production fee. Now you're lucky to get 15-20% of your production costs and you have to go out and find the other 80%."" The BBC is the only British broadcaster left that spends significant sums on new programmes, she says. ""You've got all of these extra channels but the money for content has gone down."" It is cheaper for TV channels to buy programmes made in countries with tax breaks or in the US, she says. ""We are then abandoning ourselves to North American culture because in North America it's such a big market, so people can make their money back in their home market and let it come over here cheaper."" Ms Wood's company Ragdoll tried once to outsource animation to India, where labour costs are lower, but describes that as ""a complete disaster"" because she had less control over the outcome. ""You lose the confidence and you lose the flair. We have confidence and flair in the UK and that is what's going,"" she said, adding: ""I'm deeply concerned that that heritage and wealth of talent is being eroded to the point of almost disappearing."" Andrew Haydon, Chapman Entertainment Chapman Entertainment created Fifi and the Flowertots and Roary the Racing Car, and director and co-founder Andrew Haydon says three developments have conspired against UK animators. Overseas tax breaks make it cheaper to make programmes abroad, TV stations are paying less for shows while demanding an increasing share of the profits, and the recession means revenues from toys, books and DVDs are down. ""If you put those three together then it just doesn't make it work,"" he says. Of the company's creations, Fifi and the Flowertots, Roary the Racing Car and Raa Raa the Noisy Lion have been animated in Altrincham, Cheshire, with Little Charley Bear made at Pinewood Studios, Buckinghamshire. The desire to retain the same styles of animation means there is an ""overriding need"" to keep those shows in the UK, he says. But the company's founder Keith Chapman, who created Bob the Builder, has been taking new ideas to producers in Canada. ""With brand new ones you'd be slightly mad to be doing it in the UK without a tax break or some sort of benefit,"" Mr Haydon says. ""If we do something that's new, it will be a co-production and it will be an overseas production."" Francis Fitzpatrick, Cosgrove Hall Fitzpatrick Cosgrove Hall was an animation institution, making classics including Danger Mouse, The Wind in the Willows and Chorlton and the Wheelies in its Manchester studios. It was shut by its owner ITV in 2009, but the studio was recently resurrected by its founders, the late Mark Hall and Brian Cosgrove along with entrepreneur Francis Fitzpatrick. So at a time when the rest of the industry is talking doom and gloom, why are they going back into animation? Mr Fitzpatrick replies: ""Sometimes when things are difficult, the flip side of that is that no one else is starting so there's massive opportunity."" Their new flagship show Pip! will be made in Manchester, he promises. But the UK has ""a big hill to climb"" to compete with countries like Canada, Ireland and France, he says. ""If you spend £1 in Ireland, you will get an immediate tax return of 28p. A French production company can attract up to 70% of the funding [from the government]. ""It's very challenging [in the UK]. Yes it is viable, but it would be so much better if it was on a level playing field. ""If there was more government support, I think you'd find more Thomas the Tanks, more Peppa Pigs, and the upside of that is massive boosts in revenues to the exchequer."" Phil Davies, Astley Baker Davies Animation trio Astley Baker Davies are best known for creating Peppa Pig, which is broadcast in 180 countries. Phil Davies and Mark Baker started their careers making short films for Channel 4, which closed its dedicated animation arm in 2002. ""The directors of tomorrow had natural homes to go to in short film-making when they left college, and that seems to have completely disappeared now,"" Davies says. The firm's shows, which also include Ben & Holly's Little Kingdom, are made at their base in Regent Street, London. ""We have a piece of bespoke animation software that we use to animate our series, and without that we just couldn't afford to do it over here,"" Davies explains. ""Before we would have needed 100 or 120 people. Now we've got 30 people. As film-makers we want to be in work and making something, so it's a matter of finding new and novel ways to carry on with production."" Davies says he knows ""many, many people"" who have been lured to countries like Ireland and Canada and his company has been offered ""fantastic deals"" to move production abroad. He has resisted so far because ""it's fantastically difficult to animate at arm's length"". But he adds: ""The next series or the next film that we do? I think the jury's out."" Curtis Jobling Curtis Jobling, who designed Bob the Builder and created Frankenstein's Cat, describes himself as a ""freelance creative"", coming up with ideas for shows. But in recent years he has turned to writing books because it was too difficult to get animation ideas off the ground. ""I was trying to get my shows picked up and developed by studios but I was getting a great deal of feedback from producers saying they'd love to work with me, but they can't because they've got a limited budget to work to,"" he says. ""Rather than looking overseas I've actually concentrated on the publishing side of things. I've been writing novels for the past couple of years and it hasn't been as attritional as developing animations can sometimes be. ""It is sad when you hear about people going overseas to find work. It's people throughout the industry - jobbing animators, right the way through the production process, to designers and the people who come up with the concepts. ""I know a couple of people who do a similar role to me, coming up with ideas for shows, who now just work out of LA. They've gone over there and they don't bother knocking on doors in the UK any more.""","The British animation industry, which has spawned favourites from Bagpuss to Bob the Builder, is at risk of terminal decline, leading animators have warned."
"By Tom BrookBBC News, New York In recent days Brand has been selling the contemporary remake to US journalists, putting the emphasis on its topicality. ""I think Arthur should be regarded as a fairy-tale prince - a person bestowed with wealth at birth,"" he says. ""In this year of the Royal Wedding, how wonderful to see a romantic comedy focused on a prince."" Dame Helen Mirren appears opposite Brand, stepping into the late Sir John Gielgud's shoes to play the heir's faithful servant. Yet where Gielgud was Arthur's butler in the original film, Dame Helen plays his nanny. The Oscar-winning actress shares several scenes with the larger-than-life Brand, whom she says was ""utterly disciplined"" on the set. He may have been well-behaved, but according to Dame Helen there was also room for spontaneity. ""Russell often would improvise. I would more go the route of saying, 'I could say this' and pass it by the writer."" Dame Helen, 65, sees Arthur as breaking new ground for her in career terms. ""I did it because I'd never done a big, full-out comedy before. I've done films that are comedic, but I've never done a film that is a comedy."" The actress says she often finds herself ""frightened and intimidated"" on movie sets, as was the case with Arthur. Surprisingly perhaps, she finds that she is often in awe of the big names with whom she works. ""I get totally starstruck. I can't talk to them and I don't feel good enough,"" she says. Drunkenness Brand, 35, says bringing Arthur up to date involved some adjustments, including addressing ""the changing attitude to alcoholism"". In the original picture, Arthur's constant drunkenness was presented as a harmless indulgence. Now, though, it would be viewed as full-blown alcoholism. Indeed, the new film depicts Arthur attending an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. Brand, who has admitted his own problems with addiction in the past, thinks his own experiences may have helped him with his portrayal. In a move that will alarm some recovering alcoholics, the star reveals that whiskey was on hand while the film was being shot. ""I would carry a bottle of booze about on the set and before takes have a big nostril-full of whiskey to get myself prepared, to evoke the memories of my drunken days,"" says the dandyish joker. However, Brand insists he was aware of the risks involved. ""Some people said it was dangerous and were concerned about it,"" he reveals. ""But if ever anyone saw me begin to raise it to my lips in an attempt to once more release the demons from within, then people would clutch it pretty quickly."" US actress Greta Gerwig, best known for her work in independent cinema, plays Arthur's love interest in the film. In the 1981 version that role belonged to Liza Minnelli, who has been reticent when it comes to the new production. ""It has nothing to do with me,"" the Cabaret star told reporters recently. ""I just think of Dudley so it's difficult for me, thinking of him."" Mixed reviews The Arthur remake is raising Brand's profile in the US, but ultimately he wants to make an impact away from the world of entertainment. ""One would hope that from this point I will be able to build a legacy of which I could be proud - that reaches beyond entertainment and into philanthropy and altruism."" When asked what altruistic deeds he has in mind he says: ""I think I'll have to await opportunities because I'm not a grand social architect. ""I am but a comedian, but I would just like to think that I'm prepared spiritually to be open."" Arthur performed modesty at the US box office in its opening weekend and has received some damning reviews. The New York Times referred to the film as a ""grim load of mediocrity"", while other reviewers have described it as bland and muddle-headed. Many commentators take the view that the original was such a beloved classic that any remake was bound to fall short. Yet it has some supporters. The San Francisco Chronicle, for example, found Brand ""a worthy successor to Dudley Moore who has a darkness inside him that feels right for the time and for the character"". Arthur is out in the UK on 22 April.","Comedian turned actor Russell Brand can currently be seen as Arthur, the drunken New York playboy made famous by Dudley Moore in his 1981 romantic comedy."
"He failed to turn up at a court in Chicago, leading a judge to pass the ruling against him. The woman, identified only as HW, accused Kelly of repeatedly having sex with her when she was a minor. She is also one of four accusers in a separate criminal case. He has pleaded not guilty and denied any wrongdoing. In her civil lawsuit, HW claimed the R&B singer initiated a sexual relationship with her 20 years ago when she was 16. The age of consent in Illinois is 17. The judge will determine how much Kelly should pay in damages next month. The victim sued the singer in February, a day before Kelly was arrested on 10 charges of sexual abuse.

"By Ian YoungsArts reporter, BBC News In Coniston, there are no fashionable galleries. But locals are used to having contemporary artists hanging around. Laure Prouvost's Turner-winning work Wantee was made in Coniston with the help of the local youth club, and it has just returned to the village in an attempt to boost the profile and visitor numbers of its Ruskin Museum. The work, which centres on a 14-minute video about the artist's fictional grandfather, was filmed in a wooden hut in Cumbria before going on to be shown at Tate Britain, where it was picked out by the Turner judges. The artist describes it as ""a collaboration"" with local residents. ""When we built the shed, for example, we had the youth club come in to help, and they helped us making sculptures,"" she says. ""It was made in Coniston so it's really nice that it comes back and everyone who's been involved and part of it can look at what they've made."" Wantee was co-commissioned by Grizedale Arts, a Coniston-based group with a big reputation in the art world. Grizedale has previously enlisted another Turner-nominated artist to redesign the village library and persuaded The Kinks singer Ray Davies to write a school play. Grizedale's other projects include running the youth club, setting up a shop for local crafts and breathing life into Coniston's harvest festival. This week, four artists have arrived to help design new products for the village to make and sell, with the aim of aiding the local economy. The group's artistic influence has even been felt at the annual agricultural show. ""The village veg show was just dying on its feet because it had always gone on in the same way,"" says Anne Hall, a parish and district councillor. ""They've given a new momentum to that. ""People are beginning to realise that art isn't just pictures in a gallery."" A few years ago, many villagers regarded Grizedale as ""the people who do the weird art stuff"", says its deputy director Alistair Hudson. But they are trying to prove that art is ""something ordinary"", rather than only belonging in metropolitan galleries. ""The old idea of art, which has been around for millennia, is that art as part of our everyday mechanisms for dealing with life and making things work,"" Mr Hudson says. ""You apply art - or artfulness - to everyday living. What we've tried to do in the village is demonstrate how art might come up with solutions or answers or suggestions for how things might work in village life. ""Art or artfulness or creativity then becomes part of this everyday process."" So Grizedale took over the youth club in 2012 and now enlists the members in regular art projects. It even involved the youth club in a project for the annual extravaganza of modern art excess, the Frieze Art Fair, in London in 2012. On seeing the Coniston contingent, one mover and/or shaker from the capital's art cognoscenti thought the village was an artist's elaborate creation. ""They thought it was a story made up for Frieze,"" Mr Hudson recalls. ""They didn't believe it was a real place."" Back in Coniston, Grizedale runs the Honest Shop, in which locals sell wares ranging from cakes to wood carvings. ""The system and the look of it was all designed as a product of art thinking,"" Mr Hudson says. ""But it is actually working in the world."" And this week, four artists are brainstorming with local businesses to devise new goods that the village can sell and export. ""Some might work and some might not,"" Mr Hudson says. ""It might be something that somebody who does woodcarving can make, or somebody who does baking can make. It's developing small scale businesses and enterprises."" Turner-nominated Liam Gillick fashioned new ""minimal and utilitarian crate-shelves"" for the library, while Coniston's harvest festival was transformed into an elaborate communal meal after Grizedale was asked to overhaul the staid traditional ceremony. ""We asked people to bring excess produce and spent a day cooking a big meal, dressed the table nicely, made it look great, feel nice, got artists to write the menus, thought about the plates, the cups, the whole aesthetics, so it was a wonderful experience,"" Mr Hudson says. Which is all very well. They may be good at creative thinking, but it is not really art, is it? Mr Hudson argues that Grizedale (among others) is trying to return to an era when art was embedded in real life, before the art market took off and made it the plaything of a rich elite. ""Art is a competency,"" he says. ""It's a way of thinking. It's a way of doing that you apply to life. It's not something separate."" Controversial ideas Grizedale's methods have not been embraced by everybody in the village, though. ""There are things we do that are contentious,"" Mr Hudson admits. ""Some people in the village don't like what we do. It's complicated and difficult and you have to keep chipping away and responding to it as you go along."" Coniston is lucky (or perhaps unlucky) to have an arts organisation with such expertise, contacts and £166,000 in annual Arts Council funding on its doorstep. Similar resources and creativity will not be available to most other communities. But Mr Hudson believes there are lessons that can be applied elsewhere. ""I don't think you can copy this because everywhere's different,"" he says. ""But you can certainly apply the same methodologies and tactics and ways of working. ""It's not new. It may not even be art. But anything can be art. As we know.""","Two months ago, an installation by artist Laure Prouvost won the Turner Prize. Now it has gone on show in a small museum in Coniston, Cumbria, as part of an attempt to use art to reinvigorate village life."

"By Tim MastersEntertainment correspondent The Harry Potter star has been praised for his latest role in Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead at London's Old Vic. Tom Stoppard's comedy, first performed in 1966, centres around two minor characters from Hamlet. ""My knowledge of Shakespeare is pretty limited,"" Radcliffe told the BBC after Tuesday's opening night. ""In this company, we've been talking about Hamlet a lot. And I am by far one of the least educated people on Shakespeare and Hamlet."" The 27-year-old actor said he didn't want to tackle a Shakespearean role for the sake of it. ""I never want to be feeling like I want to do that role so I can tick it off a list. ""There has to be something about the role or production that feels vital, that I feel I could bring something to. ""With Hamlet, there's a part of me that says I've seen Jude Law and Ben Whishaw do this and they were great. I don't know what I would bring to it."" He added with a laugh: ""You can throw this quote back at me in a few years when I'm playing Hamlet!"" Radcliffe's previous stage plays include Equus, Privacy and The Cripple of Inishmaan. He has also appeared in How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying, a musical. In his latest play he plays Rosencrantz opposite Joshua McGuire's Guildenstern, with David Haig on scene-stealing form as The Player. Directed by David Leveaux, the production comes 50 years after its Old Vic premiere. Here's how it went down with the critics. The Guardian's Michael Billington said: ""The cheering fact is that this is a young man's play that still seems sprightly, invigorating and even moving in its preoccupation with the inevitability of death. ""Even if the action briefly stalls in the final third, Leveaux's production keeps the momentum going."" Writing in The Telegraph, Dominic Cavendish said: ""The pacing is fleet, the timing slick, and memorable moments are in sufficiently plentiful supply."" He awarded the production four stars, adding: ""In the wrong hands, the combination of existential angst and in-jokiness could become tedious. ""But Leveaux's cast serve the combination of high-brow antics and music-hall larks, the nods to Beckett, the hints of Beyond the Fringe brilliantly."" The Daily Mail's Quentin Letts praised Radcliffe's performance but was less keen on the play as a whole, awarding the production three stars. ""[Radcliffe] is game to try to escape type-casting by throwing himself into this quasi-Beckett absurdism,"" he writes. ""He is a tidy little stage performer, light on his feet, the voice fluting but clear."" But, he noted, some Harry Potter fans who have bought tickets may struggle with the play as a whole. Ann Treneman also praised Radcliffe in her four star review for The Times. ""It's a joy to report that Daniel Radcliffe plays Rosencrantz with all the confidence of a man who has no idea who he is,"" she said. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead is at the Old Vic until 29 April. Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

"By Alice HuttonVictoria Derbyshire programme It's a scene that captures the 20-year struggle by a poor school drop-out from southern India to buy sanitary pads for his wife - and ended up changing the lives of millions of women around the world. Arunachalam Muruganantham - played by Bollywood star Akshay Kumar - cycles through his local village waving cheerfully. Unbeknown to his neighbours, he is testing the effectiveness of his new invention by wearing pink pants and a home-made sanitary pad which is slowly filling with goat's blood from a football bladder tied around his waist. But behind the laughter of the comedy- Pad Man - is the true story of how Muruganantham invented a low-cost machine that revolutionised women's healthcare. It started in 1998 when newly married Muruganantham noticed his wife Shanti hiding something. ""It was a nasty rag cloth - she was going to use it during her menstruation. I wouldn't even use it to clean my vehicle,"" he tells the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. ""So I decided to gift her a sanitary pad. The shopkeeper gave it to me as a smuggled product. Out of curiosity I opened the packet. The cotton product was sold for four rupees (4p) - 40 times what it cost to make."" Muruganantham, now 55, threw himself into researching a cheaper alternative. Period poverty leaves an estimated 300 million women in India without access to sanitary products - making them vulnerable to disease, infertility and even death. He began analysing pads from Western companies, canvassing opinions - and used napkins - of female medical students and, finally, tested his inventions out himself. ""I wanted volunteers to try my new pads and give me feedback - but not even my wife was ready."" It all came at a cost. ""My wife left, mother left. The whole village thought I had a sexual disease,"" he explains. But he persevered, and in 2006 launched not-for-profit Jayaashree Industries, which supplies machines making Muruganantham's sanitary pads at cost-price to non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and women's organisations across India. Today it reaches an estimated 40 million Indian women, and there are plans to take the machines to Kenya, Sri Lanka, Nigeria and Bangladesh. Twinkle Khanna, Pad Man's co-producer, spotted his story online and says she was immediately gripped by the magnitude of what he had achieved. ""I thought this was a remarkable story which really needed to reach every household in India, and globally, because I think the taboo around menstruation is not just in India, it's a global problem."" Khanna's husband, actor Akshay Kumar, immediately signed on to play Muruganantham. The 50-year-old, who is a popular and powerful role model in India, has a history of political message projects and is calling for sanitary pads to be made free for all women in India. ""Tackling the taboo is very important to me, because I am only now learning about the extent of the crises that countries around the world have been suffering with,"" he tells the programme. ""I'm ashamed to say how little of all this I knew, which is why this issue has become so close to my heart. ""The conversation is starting though - I've seen men talking about pads on my social media account. ""After Pad Man starts the conversation, it will be up to audiences to take it forward and help to end all of the taboos around periods worldwide."" But period poverty is not only a problem affecting women in India. In the UK, one in 10 disadvantaged girls below the age of 21 cannot afford sanitary products, according to charity Plan International UK. Manjit Gill, who co-runs London based charity Binti - which campaigns against period poverty - says the film is a watershed moment for ""smashing shame around periods"". ""We have worked with Muruganantham for a few years now - we use one of his machines in India - and he really does have a halo,"" she says. ""The conversation has definitely been started around this film - the words 'pad' and 'periods' have been used more in the last month than in the last 10 years."" The potentially revolutionary nature of Pad Man lies not only in how it tackles a subject that is still considered unmentionable in many countries, but also in the vote of confidence from distributors Sony Pictures in giving a foreign language film about periods a worldwide release as a major motion picture. The real 'Pad Man', who now has a daughter with his wife after she came back to him, feels ""happy"" about seeing his life on the big screen but prefers to throw a spotlight on the women taking the movement forward. Despite his success, he owns no shares in his company and earns roughly 70,000 Rupees (£790) a month - enough for him to cover the storage and transportation for the raw material he imports from the US and Germany. ""A school drop-out, to a rural innovator, to now [there being] a movie, shows the power of dreams,"" Muruganantham says. ""My vision is to make India into a 100% sanitary-pad using country. Menstruation is no more a taboo."" Pad Man will be released across the UK in February. Watch the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme on weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News Channel.",The world's first feature film on periods is set to be released in the UK.

"By Mark SavageBBC music reporter ""I actually gave a teacher a black eye,"" he wrote in his 1987 book The Art Of The Deal, ""because I didn't think he knew anything about music."" Mr Trump says he was ""almost expelled"" over the incident, and it suggests he's as opinionated about music as he is about trade or taxes. The president is a big fan of The Rolling Stones, Eminem and Elton John (a decidedly one-way relationship), but his favourite song is Peggy Lee's Is That All There Is? It's an interesting choice: Lee's nihilistic ballad essentially says life is a series of meaningless disappointments, so you might as well drink away your sorrows and forget about the rest of the world. Mr Trump sees it differently. ""It's a great song because I've had these tremendous successes and then I'm off to the next one. Because, it's like, 'Oh, is that all there is?'"" he told his biographer Michael D'Antonio, in 2014. So what about his Democratic rival, Joe Biden? Well, his tastes are no more up-to-date. His favourite band is traditional Irish folk outfit The Chieftains, he told People Magazine in 2012, adding: ""I would sing Shenandoah if I had any musical talent."" Shenandoah, which The Chieftains recorded in 1998, actually dates back to the early 19th Century. The story of a fur trapper who falls in love with the daughter of a Native American chief, it's steeped in romanticism for the early days of America. None of these songs have been played on the campaign trail this year - but the candidates' musical preferences at rallies and in advertisements offer a glimpse into what they think works for their supporters. Trump: Trolling critics Mr Trump's playlist leans heavily on classic rock songs that project power and combative self-confidence. He frequently plays Queen's We Are The Champions - whose refrain, ""No time for losers,"" could almost be the president's inner monologue. Tina Turner's The Best (""you're better than all the rest"") and Survivor's pugnacious Eye Of The Tiger (""just a man and his will to survive"") fulfil similar functions - conveying the idea of Mr Trump as a lone wolf, fighting the political establishment. Mr Trump often seems to be trolling critics with his choices. Why else would he play Gnarls Barkley's Crazy, or The Rolling Stones' You Can't Always Get What You Want? And his perceived persecution by the media gets a musical airing, too, through songs like Michael Jackson's Beat It. ""They told him, don't you ever come around here,"" sings the star, who once kept a home in one of Mr Trump's buildings in New York. ""Don't want to see your face, you'd better disappear."" But the song actually advocates retreat. ""You'd better leave while you can,"" Jackson advises, the message being: You think you're tough, but your opponents are tougher... so be the better man and walk away. Mr Trump's song choices are usually based on how they feel, rather than a scholarly analysis of the lyrics. His pre-speech playlist is designed to keep the audience pumped up. They often stand for hours before he comes on stage, so the focus is on timeless sing-alongs, seemingly targeted at white voters in their 50s and 60s. That means songs like Elton John's Tiny Dancer and Laura Branigan's Gloria, mixed with rousing classical numbers like Nessun Dorma and the patriotic Battle Of The Hymn Republic (Glory, Glory, Hallelujah). In recent months, as the president has courted black voters (""I did more for the Black community in 47 months than Joe Biden did in 47 years"") he has also started including a few soul classics in his set. James Brown's Please, Please, Please and Barry White's My First, My Last, My Everything were given an airing during last week's rally in Erie, Pennsylvania. Biden: Earnest decency Mr Biden's playlist has been almost evenly divided between black and white artists since he announced his candidacy in April 2019. Recently, his walk-on music has been The Staple Singers' deep cut We The People - an uplifting, soulful hymn to unity, whose title was lifted from the preamble to the US Constitution. ""You may have the black blood / Or you may have the white blood,"" sing the gospel group, ""But we are all living on blood / So don't let nobody slip into the mud."" It's the sort of message Mr Biden has sought to build his campaign around, calling for harmony and stability. He tends to favour feel-good songs like Bill Withers' Lovely Day or Jackie Wilson's (Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher and Higher. But for those paying attention, there's often a message hidden in the lyrics. ""Powers keep on lyin' / While your people keep on dyin,'"" sings Stevie Wonder in campaign staple Higher Ground - a not-so-thinly veiled reference to the Trump administration's handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. After speaking, Mr Biden usually leaves the stage to the strains of Bruce Springsteen's We Take Care Of Our Own. Like Born In The USA, the song is actually a critique of America, originally written in response to President Bush's handling of Hurricane Katrina. ""There ain't no help, the cavalry stayed home,"" sings The Boss, who says he's ""looking for the map that leads me home"". Mr Biden is, presumably, trying to align himself with Springsteen - a working-class hero who's determined to set America back on the right path. Musical gaffes But sometimes, the candidates select songs that make you wonder if they've paid attention to the words at all. What is Mr Trump trying to say when he blasts out Sympathy For The Devil, a song literally written from the perspective of Satan? And, wonderful though Haim's The Wire is, does Mr Biden realise he's being welcomed onto the stage with the lyrics: ""I fumbled it when it came down to the wire""? Mr Biden suffered another musical misfire last month, when he attempted to woo a large Puerto Rican audience in Florida by playing the Reggaeton song Despacito from his phone, while dancing awkwardly behind the podium (Luis Fonsi, who recorded the song, had just introduced him to the crowd). As right-wing pundits gleefully pointed out, Despacito is Spanish for ""slowly"" - a perfect descriptor for the candidate they refer to as Sleepy Joe. After his brush with Covid-19 earlier this month, Mr Trump has also been keen to prove he's neither slow nor sleepy, and TikTok is awash with memes of him dancing to The Village People's YMCA. In fact, the president seems functionally incapable of staying still when the song strikes up - pumping his fists back and forth, and lurching from side to side like a priest at a wedding. His supporters have even recorded a new version of the track, where YMCA becomes MAGA. The 70s disco classic has been part of Mr Trump's playlist since at least last year, but it got bumped up the running order in June when the Rolling Stones threatened to sue the campaign over the use of their song You Can't Always Get What You Want. They're not the only ones to object: Neil Young, Adele, Aerosmith, Pharrell Williams, Rihanna, Guns N' Roses and Phil Collins have all demanded not to be played at Mr Trump's rallies, with varying degrees of success. Pop endorsements The Village People were more relaxed. ""Like millions of Village People fans worldwide, the President and his supporters have shown a genuine like for our music,"" they wrote on Facebook in February. ""Our music is all-inclusive and certainly everyone is entitled to do the YMCA dance, regardless of their political affiliation."" Mr Trump also has the endorsement of country star Lee Greenwood, whose sentimental ballad God Bless the USA has been his walk-on music since 2016. ""That made me very proud,"" Greenwood told the Taste of Country website in 2017. ""I love the model 'Keep America Great' and 'Let's make it great again' so I'm all on board for that."" But Mr Trump enjoys very little support from the current crop of pop stars, with Cardi B, Taylor Swift, Lizzo, Frank Ocean and DaBaby all endorsing Mr Biden this year. And the Democratic candidate has deployed pop music to take down his opponent in campaign ads targeted at younger voters. One video posted to social media in May featured Mr Trump complaining about his treatment by the press, set to a soundtrack of Justin Timberlake's Cry Me A River. But in the end, music can only set a mood. Voters won't decide who wins based on the candidates' CD collections. In fact, a 2016 Ohio survey concluded that star endorsements had no effect on most voters' intentions in that year's presidential race - and some celebrities actually put people off. An endorsement from Beyonce was, apparently, the biggest turn-off. Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

"The Madison Square Garden Company said the dancers were volunteers and that their participation was ""their choice"". Thursday's announcement that the Rockettes would perform at the ceremony on 20 January was met with resistance by some members. A number of musicians, including Elton John, have refused to perform. The announcement led to a number of performers associated with the dance group expressing ""disappointment"". Phoebe Pearl, a member of the Rockettes, posted a message on the image-sharing network Instagram in which she said she felt ""embarrassed and disappointed"". ""I usually don't use social media to make a political stand but I feel overwhelmed with emotion,"" she said. ""The women I work with are intelligent and are full of love and the decision of performing for a man that stands for everything we're against is appalling."" On Friday, the Madison Square Garden Company issued a statement clarifying its position on the requirements of members of the Rockettes. The company said that dancers ""voluntarily sign up"" and ""are never told they have to perform"" at events. It added that for Mr Trump's inauguration, the company had received ""more requests from members to participate than we have slots available"". Meanwhile, Mr Trump has claimed that many celebrities have been requesting tickets for the event. On Friday, he tweeted: ""The so-called 'A' list celebrities are all wanting tixs to the inauguration, but look what they did for Hillary, NOTHING. I want the PEOPLE!"" That is seemingly a reference to the fact his democratic rival Hillary Clinton lost last month's presidential election despite having the support of many celebrities, including Katy Perry and Beyonce. One performer who has already been booked for Mr Trump's inauguration is 16-year-old former America's Got Talent singer Jackie Evancho. Boris Epshteyn, the communications director for Mr Trump's inaugural committee, confirmed on Thursday that the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and the Radio City Rockettes would join her. The Rockettes are a dance company, established in 1925, who have performed at Radio City Music Hall in New York since 1932. Their style covers many genres of dance, including ballet, tap, modern, and jazz. The Mormon Tabernacle Choir is a 360-piece singing group made up of volunteers.

"By Fiona BaileyEntertainment reporter, BBC News The singer, songwriter and producer may only be 25, but he has already notched up an impressive CV. The list of artists he has produced and written for is an illustrious roster of chart stars including Flo Rida, Alexandra Burke and B.o.B. But after years of working behind the scenes, Mars has started to carve out a career for himself as a solo artist. ""I signed up to be a musician, I want to perform, I want to sing,"" he says. Born Peter Gene Hernandez in Hawaii, Mars began performing from the age of 4, impersonating well known artists before deciding to make music his career. After moving to California, the star managed to sell one of his songs, which ""helped pay the rent"". He explains that first small step confirmed what he already knew, that he wanted to continue pursuing his musical career. He first came to prominence as a solo artist after featuring on and co-writing B.o.B's Nothin' on You and Billionaire by former Gym Class Heroes frontman Travie McCoy - who Mars is now touring with. ""He's such a warm dude, don't let the tattoos fool you, he's a teddy bear and he's a mentor to me,"" he says. ""I remember when we were doing the video for Billionaire, he kept telling me to look at the camera. He's been doing it for so long and I'm the new guy, so he was kind of coaching me through the music video."" Now that Mars is performing music as well as making it, he admits being in the public eye takes a bit of getting used to. ""It's not like the movies, I've learned that. I thought it was but even when you get signed, you think that hit records are going to fall into your lap and you're going to tour but it's not like that at all. ""You really have to come into it with the whole package, as a salesman, you've got to say, 'This is who I am, this is my music, get in or get out'. You have to really bring something to the table."" 'Paparazzi' In September, however, Mars was dealt his first bit of bad press when he was arrested and charged with cocaine possession in Las Vegas. The singer refuses to talk about the incident but says he does not see himself as a role model and has not received any media training on how to deal with the press. ""No, I'm a people's person, I love talking to people, so that's never been a problem to me,"" he says. ""Fortunately there's no paparazzi waiting for me outside, which is something I hope will never happen. I don't mind talking to whoever."" Mars' debut album, Doo-Wops & Hooligans, was released earlier this month in the US and entered the Billboard album chart at number three. His UK fans will have to wait until January for its release. But despite his success across the Atlantic, Mars remains laid back, revelling in deadpan jokes throughout the interview. When asked what age his main fan base are, he suggests ""73 and upwards"". He describes his music as ""very Jesus meets Fergie"" and jokingly insists he first knew he was going to be a performer from the age of six months. The singer is days away from finding out whether his song Just The Way You Are is heading back to number one in the UK. The song, first released four weeks ago, has seen record sales boom again since Matt Cardle sang it on last week's X Factor. ""It's an honour,"" Mars says.

"A spokesperson from publishers Weidenfeld & Nicolson said the company was ""deeply saddened"" to announce the writer's death after a short illness. Worth's books were based on her own experiences of being a nurse in the east end of 1950s London. Each book sold almost a million copies and spawned a new publishing sub-genre of nostalgic true life stories. Worth's midwifery tales are currently being adapted for a BBC TV series with Cranford screenwriter Heidi Thomas working on the script. Born in Clacton-on-Sea in 1935, she grew up in the Buckinghamshire town of Amersham. Worth trained as a nurse at the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading and worked as a midwife, ward sister and night sister from 1953 until 1973. She left nursing to study music and gained the Licentiate of the London College of Music in 1974. Her publishers said Worth passed away on 31 May and is survived by her husband Philip Worth, whom she married in 1963, their two daughters and three grandchildren.","Best-selling author Jennifer Worth, who wrote the popular Call the Midwife trilogy, has died aged 75."
"By Frances Cronin, Kev Geoghegan & Mark SavageArts and Entertainment reporters Fancy meeting Lady Gaga? If you had a spare $2,000 (£1,523) you could have done so at her Las Vegas concerts, where they throw in a backstage tour, pre-show reception and ""swag bag"", although it doesn't include the actual concert ticket. Not got that much cash? For a bit less you could get up close with Shawn Mendes. The top VIP package on his UK tour, which starts on Saturday, includes meeting him and getting a signed guitar. That would set you back £450. Perhaps you're thinking, ""who would pay all that?"" Well, both packages are sold out. There is high demand for the chance to rub shoulders with the stars, or at least have a photo op and an awkward encounter. Selling high-priced meet and greet opportunities is nothing new. But Matty Healy, frontman of Brit Award-winning band The 1975, ignited a debate last week when he took to Twitter, questioning why stars take part. ""I think there's two sides to the argument,"" says Gary Cohen of music management firm ATC, who represent acts like Nick Cave, Katie Melua and PJ Harvey. ""Where he's definitely right, is about the need to cherish and respect the relationship between the artist and the fans. ""Anything that looks or feels like the fans and their fandom is being taken advantage of, is a very dangerous line for an artist to tread. These things can come across as milking the fans for everything they're worth. ""However, on the flip side, touring is becoming increasingly expensive, and therefore it's incumbent upon the artists and their management teams to maximise the revenue they can generate."" Fans have also had their say, with some arguing it's a good way to support their favourite up-and-coming artists. Healy blamed the major record labels for exploiting artists, tweeting: ""I think the problem is that a lot of artists don't understand how brutal it is, because MAJOR LABELS have normalised it. ""So MAJOR LABELS should change it. They should make all fans pay in cash - directly to the artist. They should literally hand over the $200. Would soon stop."" But Livia Tortella, founder of music marketing agency Black Box and a former co-president of Warner Music, says the events meet a need. ""It depends on the band or the artist,"" she says. ""In the pop arena, it's very commonplace. In fact, some fans will actually ask, 'what does it cost to meet you?'. I would imagine with The 1975, they've set their brand so specifically that they feel there shouldn't be a charge."" Tim Dellow, co-founder of Transgressive Records and chairperson of the Association of Independent Music (AIM) adds: ""It's inherently linked to old ideas of selling out. We're kind of dealing on a spectrum of how much the individual wants to come out and give themselves beyond the music and that's a very nuanced conversation. ""We've had loads of people come to us saying 'we'll pay for an autograph', which is something, as a label, we wouldn't normally do. But when we come to pre-order a record, we find that if we put up a signed item it goes really quickly, because people do want that personal connection. ""Prince, famously, he always had these big ticket shows then he'd do jam sets for the hardcore who'd queue up for £5 tickets afterwards."" How much? Some meet and greet packages Meet and greets are more established in the US and many big UK artists don't do them. Ed Sheeran's manager Stuart Camp has explained why, saying a fan whose family has less money ""should have access to everything that the girl in the big house on the other side of town has access to"". Dellow agrees: ""I think Matty's point, as well, from what I heard of it was very much drawing a line between the haves and the have-nots; and trying to make sure that access to music and musicians is fair, which is a nice idea."" Indie veterans James joined the debate after one fan said he had paid $70 (£54) to attend the band's sound check and a Q&A with James, which was ""well worth it!"" The band said they are not ""selling access to meet the band"" but are giving fans a ""glimpse behind the scenes"". ATC's Gary Cohen says such encounters are acceptable as long as the fan ""feels like they got something really special from that meeting"", rather than a ""fleeting moment"" where a couple of hundred people snatch a few seconds each with the artist. ""That doesn't to me feel like real value for the fan. I think that's badly managed in a sense, that 'take the money and run' thing."" Of course, stars run the risk of being mocked mercilessly online, as Avril Lavigne found when she posed for incredibly awkward pictures with Brazilian fans in 2014. Nick Cave has found a different ways to connect with fans and earn money. He is currently playing a solo In Conversation... tour where he answers fan question and performs a handful of songs. ""I think every artist is different,"" Cohen says, explaining that the In Conversation format isn't right for everyone. ""They have to have an original and interesting voice and an opinion to give that concept merit, but I do think it's going to be a model now, where you look at all sorts of platforms for the ways artists can connect with their fans outside of the traditional touring and releases."" From the fan's perspective, Cheryl paid $250 (£192) to meet Fall Out Boy and thought it was worth it at the time, though has since changed her mind. Rock fan Matty spoke to the BBC about two very different experiences with meet and greets, one he paid for and one he won in a competition. ""Fall Out Boy are the only band I've paid specifically for a meet and greet,"" he says. ""The cost was approximately £100. It was a photo with the band and barely any exchange of note except a brief 'hello'. ""A signed poster was posted out at a later date (I didn't bother framing it, felt no connection to it). There were also hundreds of us in the queue."" Matty had a better experience meeting Linkin Park through a fan club. He explains: ""There was about 50 of us. Each band member came in individually, spoke to us, signed whatever we wanted and whilst this was going on, a photographer was taking photos around the room. Then we did some photos with the group.

"The presenter said it was ""one of the best jobs on television"" but felt ""it was time to move on"". He will be replaced by Sandi Toksvig, who described it as her ""dream job"". Show creator John Lloyd said Toksvig would be ""the first female host of a mainstream comedy panel show on British television - an appointment that is well overdue"". Fry's departure would be the ""end of an era"", Lloyd added. He said: ""Though we are all very sad he's decided to move on, I am confident that we have found the perfect person to occupy his gigantic shoes."" Toksvig hosts Channel 4's Fifteen To One and stood down as chair of BBC Radio Four's The News Quiz earlier this year after a 10-year run. 'Lively minds' QI was first broadcast in 2003. Fry was originally hired to be a team captain opposite Alan Davies, but he agreed to host the show as a last-minute replacement for Michael Palin ""just for the pilot [episode]"". Fry said: ""For 13 years I had one of the best jobs on television. Behind the camera squadrons of quite extraordinarily brilliant researchers, programme makers and uniquely curious (in both senses of the word) people making that job so much easier. ""In front of the camera generations of lively minds and above all of course the wonder of nature that is Alan Davies."" Davies will remain as resident panellist. The show covers topics under one letter per series, and Fry said ""after passing the alphabetical halfway mark I thought it time to move on, but I will never cease to be grateful to John Lloyd for devising QI and for everyone else for making it such fun"".

""Who knows what lies ahead? It should all be quite interesting."" Last year, Toksvig spoke out after the BBC announced a policy of having at least one woman on every panel show. Rather than recruiting more female panellists, she suggested having more female hosts would be a better way of ensuring more women were represented. ""If you get more female hosts, you'll... have more women taking part,"" she said.",Stephen Fry is to step down as the host of BBC Two comedy quiz show QI after 13 years.
"By Tim MastersEntertainment and arts correspondent, BBC News Speaking on the red carpet, Roald Dahl's daughters said their father would have been ""chuffed"" to have seen his book turned into a musical. The lavish West End production, directed by Oscar-winner Sam Mendes, is on at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane. Among the celebrities at the opening night were actresses Uma Thurman, Sarah Jessica Parker and Barbara Windsor. More than 70,000 people have already seen the show since it began previews in May. It is booking until May 2014. Dahl's much-loved 1964 book, about Charlie Bucket and the golden ticket that takes him on a magical journey through Willy Wonka's chocolate factory, has been adapted for the stage by David Greig, with songs by Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman. Douglas Hodge stars as the enigmatic sweet factory boss Wonka, while the large cast includes former Young Ones star Nigel Planer as Grandpa Joe. Dahl's daughter Lucy told the BBC: ""I've come in from California and I haven't seen any of it, so I feel like I'm one of the lucky children waiting for the gates of the chocolate factory to open."" Asked what she thought her father would have made of it, she said: ""He never bragged or showed his excitement about things on the exterior, but on the inside he would be very chuffed."" Her sister, Ophelia, who chairs the Dahl literary estate, said Mendes was ideal to direct the project. ""It's one of the best stories ever and he's one of the best directors ever - so those two things fit together very well."" Both the Dahl sisters recalled attending the premiere of the 1971 musical film Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, which starred Gene Wilder. Lucy said: ""I was about five, and I have a very vivid memory of a massive table covered in a mountain of chocolate."" The stage musical is one of the most eagerly anticipated in the West End this year. It is Mendes' first project since directing Skyfall, the most successful James Bond film of all time. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory follows the West End success of another Roald Dahl adaptation, the RSC's Matilda the Musical, which won a record number of Olivier Awards in 2012 and this year transferred to Broadway. According to Mark Shenton, theatre critic for The Stage and the Sunday Express, the big question is whether the new musical can follow Matilda's success. ""Both Charlie and Matilda target the same sort of audience,"" he said. ""Charlie has got a fantastic team behind it, so all the signs are good, but there's no such thing as a guaranteed West End hit."" Charlie and the Chocolate Factory opens in the same week as the Spice Girls musical Viva Forever! closes its doors after poor ticket sales and damning reviews. Also this week it was announced that the critically acclaimed West End revival of the musical A Chorus Line would close early at the end of August. ""Charlie has to worry about a lot of competition in the West End - but to be even half as good as Matilda is going to be a tough job,"" Shenton added. The biggest challenge for Charlie and the Chocolate Factory designer Mark Thompson was how to bring Willy Wonka's sweet factory to life on stage. Speaking on the red carpet, Thompson said that amid the hi-tech scenery he had resorted to some ""quite old-fashioned"" devices such as the use of projections on a front cloth. ""My aim was to surprise people but also not to unsettle them,"" he told the BBC. ""I want people to leave on a high.""",Celebrities have turned out in London for the gala opening of the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory musical.

"The miniature work, called The Young Men's Magazine, will go to the Parsonage Museum in the Brontes' old home in Haworth, West Yorkshire. It was bought for €600,000 (£512,970) after a fundraising campaign by the Bronte Society, which runs the museum. The museum lost out on the book when it last went under the hammer in 2011. The total price including buyer's premium was €780,000 (£666,790). The work is one of six ""little books"" written by Charlotte, the eldest of the three sisters, in 1830. Five are known to survive, and the Bronte Parsonage Museum already holds the other four. The works were created for Charlotte's toy soldiers and document an imaginary world created by the family called Glass Town. Charlotte is best known for her 1847 classic novel Jane Eyre. Kitty Wright, executive director of The Bronte Society, said: ""We were determined to do everything we could to bring back this extraordinary 'little book' to the Bronte Parsonage Museum and now can't quite believe that it will in fact be coming home to where it was written 189 years ago. ""We have been truly overwhelmed by the outpouring of support from people from all over the world backing our campaign and can't wait to have it in place with the others and on public view to the world."" 'An absolute highlight' The museum's principal curator Ann Dinsdale added that bringing the ""unique manuscript"" back to Haworth was an ""absolute highlight"" of her 30-year career at the venue. ""Charlotte wrote this miniscule magazine for the toy soldiers she and her siblings played with and as we walk through the same rooms they did, it seems immensely fitting that it is coming home and we would like to say an enormous thank you to everyone who made it possible."" Part of the Young Men's Magazine describes a murderer driven to madness after being haunted by his victims, and how ""an immense fire"" burning in his head causes his bed curtains to set alight. Experts at the museum say this section of the story is ""a clear precursor"" of a famous scene between Bertha and Edward Rochester in Jane Eyre, which Charlotte would publish 17 years later. The society said more than 1,000 people had pledged money to help buy the book. Several celebrities, including Dame Judi Dench, Dame Jacqueline Wilson and Tracy Chevalier, backed the society's efforts to raise money. York-born Dame Judi, who is president of the Bronte Society, said earlier this year: ""I have long been fascinated by the little books created by the Brontes when they were children. ""These tiny manuscripts are like a magical doorway into the imaginary worlds they inhabited, and also hint at their ambition to become published authors."" The existence of the book that went up for sale - measuring 35mm x 61mm and consisting of 20 pages - came to light in 2011 when it was auctioned at Sotheby's. The Bronte society was outbid by a discredited investment scheme that is no longer operational. The scheme was run by Gérard Lhéritier and his company Aristophil, who set up the Musee des Lettres et Manuscrits in Paris. Lhéritier saw the potential financial rewards in rare works such as the Bronte book, so bought and filled his museum with them. His company was accused of selling shares in a Ponzi-style pyramid scheme, built on false advertising and illusionary market values. About 18,000 people in France are believed to have been defrauded in what went on to become one of the biggest ever arts market scams, having invested nearly €1bn. The company behind it was shut down by regulators in 2014. According to The Art Newspaper, the French government is seeking to recover hundreds of public archives that should never have been sold and a criminal investigation is ongoing. Lhéritier denies all accusations. Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

"The South African-born English writer also penned the lyrics to the 1960 song Goodness Gracious Me, made famous by Peter Sellers and Sophia Loren. And he worked with French singer Charles Aznavour on his 1974 hit She. Paying tribute online, fellow lyricist Sir Tim Rice described him as ""a giant of his trade"", adding: ""RIP Herbie."" Les Misérables producer Sir Cameron Mackintosh said the news was ""terribly sad"", and ""his wonderful words for Les Miserables will live on in his memory forever more"". In his day job as a journalist, Kretzmer became senior drama critic at the Daily Express, and later wrote television criticism for the Daily Mail. But he stressed in a 2013 interview with The Guardian that it was his role in coming up with the English lyrics to Les Misérables that would go on to define his career and life. 'Changed my life' ""I returned to the Mail, but then it became clear that the show had a fairly certain future: I was able to give up my day job at 61,"" he said. ""Les Misérables has brought me my London house and my wife, whom I met at the opening-night party in New York. I often marvel at how those few feet between [producer] Cameron Mackintosh's sofa and his door changed my life."" In the same interview, he explained that his role in coming up with famous songs, which included Do You Hear the People Sing and I Dreamed a Dream, was as much about re-imagining them as it was translating them from the French original. ""The word 'translation' makes me shiver,"" he explained. ""Words can resonate in one culture but not another, so I read the novel and then told the story in my own way."" 'A work that speaks to the rest of the world' In a joint statement, the musical's original French songwriters, Alain Boublil and Claude-Michel Schönberg, described their counterpart as ""a vibrant, hard-working man, but above all a man with an exceptional moral force as well as a brilliant lyricist"". They wrote: ""Thanks to him, Les Misérables found its English voice - Herbie embraced our original version and turned it into a work that speaks to the rest of the world. Kretzmer also wrote the 1960s West End shows Our Man Crichton, starring Millicent Martin; and The Four Musketeers, starring Harry Secombe.

"By Fiona BaileyEntertainment reporter, BBC News The Paparazzi star moved up four positions from last year and has knocked TV chat show host Oprah Winfrey of the top spot. But how has the singer become such a global phenomenon in such a short space of time? Four experts in music, fashion and social networking give their verdicts. George Ergatoudis - Head of Music Radio 1 ""The key thing is Lady Gaga realised by using all the current social networking sites, and integrating that with her fashion, she has become an all-round entity. Every time she goes out the door she's looking different, she's getting photographed, she's aware of that and she's using it by updating herself literally on a daily basis. There's always something interesting about her for people to talk about. It excites both the social networking space and potential fans but has also become a huge matter of public interest. Another key thing was that quite early on, her record label decided one of the things that was missing from the story was showing how gifted she is as a musician. They put her in the record company office with a piano and they filmed her doing several of her singles. They put it up on YouTube and that had an incredible effect too. A lot of pop artists are brilliantly polished in the studio by the producer, autotuned within an inch of their life but underneath it, she genuinely is a very, very talented and gifted musician. She feeds that insatiable appetite for that continually updated image and story but her music alone would have been enough to get her support at Radio 1. The music she makes, the songs she writes, the production she has are all brilliant, contemporary pop music. She literally is turning into a global superstar."" ""Social media is a reflection of what we love, so people are becoming very good at sharing exactly what they love and the brands and musicians they love. YouTube is one of the biggest search engines in the world, people are now discovering new music that way. The fact she has 10 million Twitter followers and 30 million Facebook fans is a massive reflection on Lady Gaga and the influence she has. Once out there, Twitter and Facebook help keep that person's profile alive. Her fans are constantly talking about her and sharing everything she does even when she's not on stage or in concert. People can go to her gig, take photos, record video and then that footage lives on. I think even if she wasn't on Facebook and Twitter, her fans and followers would put her there anyway. But the most important thing is, she is on there and she's harnessing that. People relate to her and social networking is all about that personal connection. People look at her background and where she's come from and they look at what she's achieved in a relatively short period of time."" ""She's kept really close attention to everything, so if you look at her live show, it's really closely co-ordinated and she works with her own company - The House of Gaga to do it. She's got a really good idea of what she wants and how to do it, and that's what makes a really strong brand. In terms of money, she ploughs a lot of the money she makes into touring and you could call that a fundamental business strategy because it's essentially making a better product. I think she's done it by making good music. She creates really good live performances and has a good level of control over what she does, working with people close to her - which is always a good idea. She's also got very communication with her fans so information comes directly from her."" ""She seems to be fearless. We can see that she's fearless on stage and she seems to be fearless every time she opens her mouth. She's not held back by the things that most women in the public eye are held back by, which is wanting to be sexy and glamorous. Basically what most women want to be is to be pretty and I don't think she cares. We can see that when she puts those ugly bumps under her head or paints her whole face like a skeleton. I think prettiness and being admired by straight men comes quite low down on her scale of importance, which makes her very different. I also think it makes her the fashion industry's dream because she is happy to wear the kind of avant garde art that they create. She doesn't want to look glamorous and be at the top of the best dressed polls. I think she is a fashion icon. In terms of it filtering down to the high street, you think 'there's no way anyone is ever going to go out wearing electric blue nipple plasters and nine inch heels' but I think you'd be surprised at the subtle ways it does factor down. You always think she is never going to top her last outfit - I think the meat dress is the one that comes to most people's minds - but then the next week she has gone out in something else extreme, like shoes that look like she must have been wheeled onto stage. She really knows how to keep shocking people. She's definitely got to be very quirky and eccentric to be going to these lengths, but ultimately it does get her on to the front pages. With a new album out this week and going out dressed in ludicrous outfits, it is going to get her publicity. She's not stupid, she knows to capitalise on that.""","Just three years since Lady Gaga had her first US number one single, the pop star has claimed the top spot in Forbes magazine's annual Celebrity 100 list."
"By Mark SavageBBC music reporter Mariah Carey's festive hit All I Want For Christmas Is You returned to Spotify's Top 40 last Sunday - a full two weeks earlier than three years ago. The song also reappeared on the iTunes chart on 2 November, and is currently among the UK's Top 50 downloads. Carey is expected to re-enter the UK's official chart on Friday. The song is already at 63 in the midweek countdown. A re-entry would give All I Want For Christmas Is You its 100th week in the top 100, and mark the song's 14th consecutive year on the chart. The return of Carey's hit is a bellweather for the start of Christmas season. Behind her in the Spotify chart are six more Christmas songs, including The Pogues' Fairytale of New York and Michael Bublé's It's Beginning To Look A Lot Like Christmas. Between them, the songs have more than 500,00 daily plays. However, the UK lags behind countries like Estonia and Iceland, where listeners start shuffling their Christmas playlists in October, according to Spotify data. They are all beaten by The Philippines, where Christmas music accounts for 2% of all songs streamed by early September. Listeners in Lichtenstein, meanwhile, are the most ardent consumers of seasonal songs. In the last few days before 25 December, almost 70% of all listening is exclusively Christmas music - triple the global average. The UK puts up some stiff competition, though. Not only are we listening to festive hits earlier every year, but Magic Radio launched its 100% Christmas station in August due to consumer demand. Not to be outdone, Amazon Music has just released a stocking-full of exclusive Christmas songs on its streaming service, with Justin Bieber covering Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree and Mary J Blige taking on Wham's Last Christmas, amongst others. Can LadBaby score a third number one? The race for the Christmas number one is also shaping up, led by Children In Need's charity cover of Oasis' Stop Crying Your Heart Out. The all-star song features vocals from Cher, Kylie, Robbie Williams, KSI, Ava Max, Jess Glynne and Bryan Adams, amongst others, with the video set to premiere during the Children In Need telethon on Friday. BBC Sound of 2020 winner Celeste is also vying for a festive hit, after soundtracking the John Lewis Christmas advert with her new single, A Little Love. Inspired by the kindness shown by the British public during lockdown, it is the first original song (ie non-cover version) to feature on one of the retailer's adverts. Proceeds will go to the charities Home-Start and FareShare. For the last two years, YouTube personality LadBaby has topped the festive charts with pastry-themed cover versions like I Love Sausage Rolls and We Built This City (On Sausage Rolls). The star, who donates his earnings to the Tressell Trust food charity, hasn't announced his plans for 2020. If he scores a third consecutive Christmas number one, he will equal a record set by The Beatles, who were the stars atop the festive countdown in 1963, 64 and 65. Speaking to Radio 1 last year, LadBaby said he would only attempt a third record if the right idea came along, ""I don't want it to become a joke,"" he said. ""It needs to still be funny and it needs to still be right. I don't want people to start boycotting it next year if we go for it."" How Mariah wrote her classic But Mariah Carey's All I Want For Christmas Is You is the gift that keeps on giving. First released in 1994, it's an upbeat, catchy tribute to the Christmas hits of Motown and Phil Spector. A top three hit on both sides of the Atlantic, it quickly became a standard, with the New Yorker calling it ""one of the few worthy modern additions to the holiday canon"". After selling more than 16 million copies, it finally topped the US charts last year, on its 25th anniversary, making Carey the first artist to score a number one single in four different decades. ""We did it!"" exclaimed the star on Twitter, adding emojis of a crying face, a heart, a lamb, a Christmas tree, and a butterfly (her signature), for good measure. Carey co-wrote the song with longtime collaborator Walter Afanasieff, who originally worried it was too basic. But that's exactly the quality that has made it such an enduring hit. ""The oversimplified melody made it easily palatable for the whole world to go, 'Oh, I can't get that out of my head!"" he said in an interview with ASCAP. Writing in her memoir, Carey said the song's opening chimes are meant to evoke the ""little wooden toy pianos, like the one Schroeder had on Peanuts"". ""I actually did bang out most of the song on a cheap little Casio keyboard,"" she added. ""But it's the feeling I wanted to capture. There's a sweetness, a clarity and a purity to it."" Although she was unhappy at the time, dealing with the pressures of fame and a tempestuous relationship with her future husband Tommy Mottola, she wanted to ""write a song that would me me happy and make me feel like a loved, carefree young girl at Christmas"". ""I wanted to sing it in a way that would capture joy for everyone and crystallise it forever,"" she added. ""Yes, I was going for vintage Christmas happiness.""

"The German designer, who was the creative director for Chanel and Fendi, died in Paris on Tuesday. The designer became a devoted cat owner and lavished attention on his pet after Choupette was given to him in 2012. Lagerfeld told French magazine Numero last year that he had named the birman cat as one of the heirs of his estate. In the interview, he said Choupette was in his will, ""among others"". But he added: ""Don't worry, there is enough for everyone."" Choupette already has a substantial fortune to her name, having earned $3m (£2.3m) doing adverts for a German car firm and a Japanese cosmetics brand with Lagerfeld. In a separate interview with Numero, Lagerfeld revealed he employed two maids to look after the pampered animal who, he said, has ""four different dishes prepared for her"" each day ""served in fabulous bowls"". He also made Choupette a social media sensation, with her own Twitter and Instagram accounts that have a combined following of about 200,000. A tribute to the designer was posted on the cat's Twitter account on Tuesday. She is also the hero of a book, Choupette: The Private Life of a High-Flying Fashion Cat, for which she was photographed in the arms of supermodel Linda Evangelista and snuggling with the model and actress Laetitia Casta. The book includes recipes for her favourite meals prepared by some of the best restaurants in Paris. One typically lavish meal is a mixture of king crab, smoked salmon and caviar. Choupette's help was sometimes sought by those trying to persuade Lagerfeld to adopt their ideas. French actress and animal rights activist Brigitte Bardot wrote her a letter in 2015 asking her to ""purr in the ear"" of her owner so he would ""stop using fur in his collections"". Chanel duly became the first major fashion house to go fur-free. Pampered pets Lagerfeld is not the only celebrity to want to make provision for their animals' welfare in their will. Fashion designer Alexander McQueen left £50,000 in his £16m will so his dogs could be pampered for the rest of their lives. Oprah Winfrey has reportedly made plans to leave around $30m (£23m) to her dogs. But Bubbles, the chimpanzee once owned by the late singer Michael Jackson, was not so lucky. When he grew into an adult and started showing signs of aggression, he was sent to an animal sanctuary. Once he'd been moved to the home, Jackson did not pay for Bubbles' upkeep. The singer's estate now sends some money to the sanctuary in Florida where he is housed every year, but it reportedly does not cover all the costs of looking after him. Bubbles has been earning his keep, though. Some of his artwork has been sold to raise money for the sanctuary. Paws for thought: Five other famous felines 1. Larry, the Downing Street cat Larry lives with the PM at Number 10, and is the Cabinet Office's chief mouser. He has his own Twitter account, which often passes comment on the issues of the day. 2. Palmerston, the Foreign Office cat Not to be outdone, Palmerston also has his own Twitter account, and there's even a parody Twitter account, where he makes it clear that it is he - and not Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt - who is really in charge of proceedings. 3. Venus, the cat with two faces In 2012, Venus was briefly the most famous feline on the planet when a YouTube video of the unusual tortoiseshell was viewed more than a million times. A rare quirk of her genes means she has two distinctly different sides to her face. One half is solid black with a green eye and the other half has tabby stripes and a blue eye. 4. Snoopybabe Exotic short-hair Snoopybabe, or Snoop for short, hails from from Chengdu in China's Sichuan Province. The wide-eyed feline has amassed more the 300,000 Instagram followers. 5. Keyboard Cat Fatso - AKA Keyboard Cat - passed away in 1987, but found posthumous fame as an internet meme.

"They said he had endured a ""long-term battle with a progressive lung condition"" which ""rapidly worsened towards the end of this year"". He died at home on Monday with his family by his side, who said they were ""heartbroken"". Tributes have been paid from the world of entertainment for the ""true telly legend"". His career spanned five decades. 'Life and soul' Chegwin was perhaps best known for hosting programmes including children's game show Cheggers Plays Pop, Swap Shop and Saturday Superstore. The Liverpool-born star began his career as a child actor, starring in films such as Roman Polanski's Macbeth and TV shows including The Liver Birds, The Adventures of Black Beauty and Z-Cars. He went on to appear in reality TV shows including Celebrity Big Brother. The larger-than-life character, described by his family as ""a loving husband, father, son, brother, uncle and friend"", leaves his wife Maria and two children. Chegwin had been cared for at a hospice in recent weeks. His last tweet was posted on 28 September. 'Childhood memories' Chegwin was previously married to fellow TV presenter Maggie Philbin, whom he had met on Swap Shop. Philbin paid tribute to her former husband, saying: ""It is incredibly sad. Keith was a one-off. Full of life, generous and with a focus on things that mattered - his family. ""I saw him two months ago at his sister Janice's wedding, where he was still attempting to be life and soul of the party despite being on portable oxygen and made sure he knew how much he meant to us all. ""Our daughter Rose flew home from San Francisco to be with him over the last few weeks and I know he was surrounded by so much love from his second wife Maria, their son Ted, his sister Janice, his twin brother Jeff and his father Colin."" Fellow Swap Shop presenter Noel Edmonds said in a statement: ""I've lost my first real telly chum and I'm certain I'm not alone in shedding tears for a true telly legend. ""The greatest achievement for any TV performer is for the viewers to regard you as a friend and today millions will be grateful for Keith's contribution to their childhood memories and like me they will mourn the passing of a friend."" Ricky Gervais, who created the series Extras which Chegwin starred in, described him as a ""national treasure"". 'Great character' Gaby Roslin, who worked with Chegwin on The Big Breakfast, described him as ""so generous and kind"" and a ""happy and joyous man"". John Craven, who worked with Chegwin on Swap Shop told BBC News that his colleague ""never lost his cool. I never saw Keith when he wasn't happy. He was a great, great character."" He added: ""We were great friends for many years, but we lost touch a bit and [his death] came as a huge shock for me."" Presenter Chris Evans, who worked with Chegwin on the Big Breakfast, tweeted: ""Very sad and shocked to hear of the passing of Keith Chegwin. The king of outside broadcast."" Bobby Davro said Chegwin was ""one of the nicest guys"" in showbiz. And Tony Blackburn said he was ""devastated"" at the loss of his friend. Blackburn told BBC News that Chegwin was ""exactly the same (off air) as he was on television"" and that he never saw him with a script. ""He was the most lovely person I've ever met and I'm so sad he's no longer with us,"" he added. 'Saturday morning hero' Breakfast presenter Lorraine Kelly said he was ""a kind, funny, brave man"". And Fiona Phillips, who also worked with him on breakfast TV, also paid tribute to her friend. Phillip Schofield, who presented Saturday morning show Going Live, described Chegwin as ""one of my many original Saturday morning heroes"". Chegwin also had a hit single with I Wanna Be A Winner in 1981. The novelty hit, which was recorded by Chegwin and his Swap Shop co-hosts under the name Brown Sauce, reached number 15 in the charts. His career fell away in the 80s and 90s and he had a well-documented struggle with alcoholism for many years. But it was revived by a stint on the Big Breakfast. He went on to make infamous Channel 5 nudist gameshow Naked Jungle, appearing naked except for a hat - which he later described as the ""worst career move"" of his ""entire life"". Chegwin - known affectionately by the nickname Cheggers - also appeared in Celebrity Big Brother, Bargain Hunt Famous Finds and Dancing on Ice. He was due to appear in the 2012 Dancing on Ice series but had to pull out after breaking his ribs during the first day of rehearsal. He returned as a contestant the following year. He also took part in Pointless Celebrities and Masterchef. The disease Chegwin had is called idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, which causes scarring of the lungs.

"By Frances CroninEntertainment reporter YouTube star Joe Sugg's life has changed in many ways since he started Strictly Come Dancing 14 weeks ago. ""Suggs aren't known for their calves, but I can actually feel a calf now,"" he says proudly. ""Look, I've got calves!"" Speaking to the press on the last day of rehearsals for the Strictly final, Joe is contemplating how far he's come. ""I never thought I'd be sat here now,"" he says. ""I just thought, give it a chance and see what happens. It's a whole new audience and it's just gone down an absolute storm."" Although he already has more than eight million subscribers to his YouTube channel, he's loving the new fanbase he's acquired. ""Nowadays I think I get stopped more out and about by the older generation who know me from Strictly than from YouTube, which has been so nice,"" he says. ""But on the other side of things, I've had so many positive messages from my own audience who have followed me into this. ""I've been having messages from younger guys saying, 'I would never normally think of doing dance but from watching you on Strictly I can see you're having so much fun'. And I'm not cool but somehow for them I've made it more acceptable. ""And they're now going to dancing classes with their girlfriend or with their friends, and for me one of the best things about doing this show is its effect on the younger generation and hopefully getting them into dance."" Documentary maker Stacey Dooley is the bookies' favourite to win, and she's also enjoying her new wider fanbase. ""What it's bought for me personally is you're able to have conversations with the general public about lighter celebratory things. Work's so intense, it can be so harrowing and it's very serious and has to be. ""So for me it's just been people stopping me in Sainsbury's saying, 'I loved your samba when you had feathers coming out of your body'. Or they'll say, 'Oh I danced to that song at me wedding'. They're so invested."" And with dance partner Kevin Clifton, she's developed a passion for dance that she can't see going away. ""I really didn't realise I'd love it this much... Sometimes Kev walks in to make the tea and I'm watching ballroom dancing on my phone, or [head judge] Shirley Ballas dancing in the '80s. She was amazing. It's just crazy."" For Ashley Roberts, the route to the final has been the most eventful. The former Pussycat Doll has been in the dance-off three times and has been criticised for having too much dancing experience. She admits she was surprised by how much of a ""emotional rollercoaster ride"" it would be. ""It has been an emotional journey, it has been up and down,"" she says. ""I think in our adventure we've experienced the highest of the highs and the lowest of the lows and the full spectrum of the Strictly experience. ""We did have to battle out three times to get to the final but we stayed motivated and stayed in positive thoughts and we made it, so woo hoo!"" She also addresses the question of her previous dance training, which has often been cited as the reason why she wasn't getting the public votes. ""I did do dance when I was younger - it was a completely different style,"" she says. ""It's kind of like asking a soccer player to play basketball - it is two completely different forms of dance and it's been 20 years since I was trained. ""I absolutely love that I got asked to be here and I'm so grateful that I got to learn Latin and ballroom and it's been an amazing experience. ""I thought it would be physically challenging - but it's all been worth it. The show has lit a fire in me to perform, I forgot how much I love doing it."" Meanwhile, pop star Faye Tozer has been enjoying being known as Faye from Strictly rather than Faye from Steps. ""I'm really lucky outside of Steps that I do a lot of musical theatre, so for me Strictly has just raised a massive platform and shown people more of what I can do outside of Steps, so that's been a really exciting thing for me, so more of the above please,"" she says. Like Ashley, Faye also has a dance and performing background, but she doesn't think it should detract from the enjoyment of the show. ""With every Strictly series there's been a mix of abilities, but it's an entertainment show at the end of the day and I think it's been lovely to see everybody's individual journey and it's been amazing to be part of the celeb team. It's been a brilliant series."" What next for the celebs? Joe says his success on Strictly has made him ""much more open"" to looking beyond YouTube and performing professionally in the future. ""I went into this thinking, cool, I'm gonna do this and then go back to YouTube,"" he reflects. ""I love what I do and the reason I had this opportunity in the first place was because of my YouTube channel. But now afterwards..."" Stacey won't be giving up her hard-hitting documentaries - but wants to carry on having some fun too. ""Documentaries are my passion and I'm going back to them after Christmas,"" she says. ""But one of the reasons I did Strictly was to show my lighter side. ""I am a documentary maker who makes serious programmes, but also I am just a young girl who enjoys the entertainment side of things so I suppose [I want to do] a bit of both in an ideal world."" With the public on her side, she could finally be the one to give Kevin - a four-time runner-up - the chance to get his hands on the glitterball. But she insists they aren't counting on a win. ""I want to go into the final with no real expectations in terms of what's going to happen,"" she explains. ""I want it to feel like a massive party. ""We've had such an incredible couple of months - all of us - so I want us to come together collectively and celebrate.""

"The Swedish Oscar-winner takes over from Angelina Jolie in the latest film to be drawn from the popular video game franchise. Described as a reboot, the film is said to be an origins tale drawn from the plot of the Tomb Raider game released in 2013. Directed by the fabulously named Roar Uthaug, it's due out in March 2018. Vikander, who won an Oscar for The Danish Girl, describes Lara as ""a truly iconic character"" who acts as ""a model for many young women"". ""She's trying to carve out her place in the world and connect her future with her past,"" the 28-year-old told Vanity Fair. Norwegian director Uthaug said the film - which also stars Dominic West as Croft's father - would focus ""not only on Lara's strength and physical accomplishments but her humanity"". ""We see Lara as a young woman, smart and capable but largely unfocused, and follow her on a dangerous journey that will push her to her limits in every sense,"" he went on. Jolie previously played the role in 2001's Lara Croft: Tomb Raider and its 2003 sequel, Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life.

"By Neil SmithEntertainment reporter With a title like The Wife, it's hardly surprising Glenn Close's latest film - out in the UK this week - is a family affair. Yet this story of a woman whose writer husband is chosen to receive the Nobel Prize for Literature puts family relations to the fore both on and off the screen. For one thing, the younger version of Close's Joan Castleman character is played in flashbacks by Annie Starke, the actress's 30-year-old daughter. In addition, Joan's son David is played by Max Irons, whose father Jeremy starred opposite Close in Reversal of Fortune and The House of the Spirits. Close says she deliberately stayed away from set on the days her daughter was shooting her scenes. ""I didn't want Annie to feel her mother was hovering around,"" the actress says. ""It was important she worked independently of me."" It was Close who suggested to her Swedish director, Bjorn Runge, that Starke take on the role, which became available after a previously cast actress withdrew from the project. She did so with the firm conviction Starke would more than hold her own against such actors as Downton Abbey's US star Elizabeth McGovern and Britain's Harry Lloyd, known for Game of Thrones and Wolf Hall. ""Being my daughter is something Annie has had to contend with her whole life,"" she reveals. ""I've always been aware of how difficult it has been for her sometimes. ""The thing that gives me great joy is that I think she'll have a phenomenal career. I've thought from when she was very little that she had a natural talent."" Phenomenal is an apt word to describe Close's own career, which spans four decades and straddles television, film and the stage. The recipient of six Oscar nominations, she is the winner of three Primetime Emmys, three Tonys, two Golden Globes and a SAG award. Her many successes include Fatal Attraction, Dangerous Liaisons, TV drama Damages and the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical Sunset Boulevard. Now 71, she has reached the age where lifetime achievement awards are coming her way. (Her visit to last year's Zurich Film Festival, for example, saw her presented with its Golden Icon Award.) ""It's nice to have a body of work that's worthy of a lifetime achievement award,"" she smiles. ""I'm at a point in my career where there's a lot to look back on. ""What is important is you do work that is authentic to you and feel fulfilled and challenged by... and that you spend your creative life with people who are worth leaving home for."" One of those people is Britain's Jonathan Pryce, who plays Joan's far-from-perfect husband Joe. A much-feted author with a formidable literary reputation, he is also a self-absorbed philanderer who adores being the centre of attention. ""I was thrilled to work with Jonathan and I was very grateful he supported me in a movie called The Wife,"" his co-star gushes. ""We couldn't find an American actor who would do that. ""Jonathan had the courage not to ask for the audience's pity or even their understanding. What he does in the film breaks my heart."" Set in the days preceding Joe's Nobel presentation, The Wife sees Joan begin to question the 40 years she has spent supporting her husband at the cost of her own dreams and ambitions. ""Joan is a complex woman,"" says Close. ""It was a real challenge for me to try to understand her and where she is at this very crucial point in her life. ""I didn't know when I said yes to the movie if I could find a reason why she stayed with him for so long. That was my first question, and I knew all women would ask the same thing."" Compared to some of the other demands that come with her job, though, playing Joan was a breeze. ""For me the most painful part of what I have to do is finding something to wear on the red carpet,"" she sighs. The Wife is out in the UK on 28 September.

"By Helen BushbyEntertainment and arts reporter His Instagram video sees him stare into the camera, slowly lifting and then lowering a boxed Superman doll, while The Blue Danube - which features barking dogs - plays in the background. It follows The Hollywood Reporter saying the British actor is ""parting ways with Warner Bros"". Warner has not confirmed the story. ""While no decisions have been made regarding any upcoming Superman films, we've always had great respect for and a great relationship with Henry Cavill, and that remains unchanged,"" they said in a statement to CNN. Anna Smith, film critic and president of the Critics' Circle, told the BBC that if the speculation about Cavill leaving the role is true, she'd ""love to imagine it's because he is preparing take on the role of James Bond"". She added: ""The DC movies have been squandering his gift for suave comedy, which we saw in The Man from U.N.C.L.E. and which would take Bond back to the old school (minus the sexism, I hope)."" What, if anything, happened here? Hollywood Reporter suggested negotiations with Cavill broke down over scheduling problems for a cameo appearance in upcoming film Shazam!, about a teenage boy who transforms into a superhero. However, the actor's manager Dany Garcia suggested those reports may be premature, urging fans to ""be peaceful, the cape is still in his closet"". Many fans were keen that he should stay in the role. One called the speculation ""a ridiculous rumour"", with other comments such as ""hope to God you're staying on as Superman, if not be the next Bond. Ur amazing actor"". One said: ""I have decided to shift to Marvel... because Henry Cavill is the only reason for me to become DC fan..."" Some, however, had other ideas. The BBC has asked Warners and Cavill's representatives for comment. Why might Superman need a reboot? IGN Entertainment's senior editor Scott Collura wrote that ""it's insane, if not surprising, that Warner Bros doesn't have a Superman any more"". He said Warner Bros ""don't know what to do with the Man of Steel"". ""With Cavill apparently out, and [Batman actor] Ben Affleck rumoured to also be ready to hang up the cape and cowl, Warners and the folks behind the DC films are presented with an opportunity to soft-reboot the series,"" he added. DC may be looking for a major change of direction for Superman after the runaway success of Wonder Woman, which smashed box office records last year and will be followed by a much-awaited upcoming sequel. Cavill's Man of Steel ""did good blockbuster business"" in 2013 but ""studio expectations were higher"", according to Forbes. Things didn't improve with 2016's Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice, which got a mixed critical response and was seen as ""relentlessly bleak"" as well as a financial disappointment, according to Deadline Hollywood. Roll on to 2017's Justice League, powered by a DC Comics superhero team seeking some of the huge popularity of the Avengers ensemble films. But Justice League, with a cast including Cavill, Affleck and Gal Gadot, was an ""undeniable failure"" according to Forbes, because it ""didn't recoup its costs"". Anna Smith adds: ""In recent years, DC has found it hard to compete with the might of the Marvel movies - the Avengers gang are much sunnier and teen-friendly, while the Superman films have struggled to find the right balance between deliciously dark and downright sombre. ""Wonder Woman struck a much more upbeat and exciting tone (and in the hands of a female director, take note!)."" Forbes concluded: ""If you're Warner Bros, you cannot simply ignore the fact your Superman has repeatedly failed to live up to expectations critically, financially, or in sheer popularity."" What could happen next? Deadline is reporting that this could be a chance to shift DC's focus to Supergirl, as well as continuing to ride the success of Gadot as Wonder Woman, with its upcoming sequel set in 1984 (look out for those flicked hairdos). Another forthcoming film out of the DC stable will be Aquaman, starring Game of Thrones' Jason Momoa as Arthur Curry, who learns he's the heir to the underwater kingdom of Atlantis. And of course Shazam! is due out next year as well. These films are brighter in tone than their bleaker Superman/Batman predecessors. Who could replace Cavill as Superman, if he really has hung up his cape? Deadline is reporting that Black Panther's Michael B Jordan could be in line for the role, while bookmaker William Hill is touting Once Upon A Time's Colin O'Donoghue, followed by Sam Claflin, Armie Hammer, Channing Tatum, Cillian Murphy and Donald Glover.

"By Steven McIntoshEntertainment reporter BBC One's latest drama, Life, is a spin-off from Doctor Foster, which launched in 2015 and was watched by an audience of more than 10 million. Life is set in the same world as its predecessor, but only features one familiar character - Victoria Hamilton's Anna, the friendly neighbour who always had a glass of wine in her hand. But does that mean viewers need to have seen all of Doctor Foster to understand its new spin-off, which begins on Tuesday night? ""Absolutely not, no,"" says Hamilton. ""To an extraordinary degree, I think, you really don't need to have seen it. ""Life is a very complete story on its own, this is an entirely different universe and you're given everything you need to know about it in episode one of this story."" Those who did watch Doctor Foster may remember that Anna left Parminster in series two, having discovered that her husband had been unfaithful again. In Life, Anna has changed her name to Belle (as her full name is Annabel) and is trying to start afresh. But she is just one of several main characters, who all live in close proximity to one another. Set in Manchester, the series follows the residents of a large house divided into four flats, and also stars Adrian Lester, Alison Steadman and Melissa Johns. The neighbours don't know each other well, and yet their lives intertwine in unexpected ways. Writer Mike Bartlett (who was also behind Doctor Foster) was intrigued by how the characters' actions could impact on each other, often without them realising. ""I used to live in a flat which was part of an old house that had been divided up, and I was amazed that we were all one stud wall away from each other, but didn't really know each other,"" he explains. ""We would hear the most intimate details of each other's sex lives and love lives, and yet you'd meet in the corridor, and you wouldn't exchange two words. ""And I found that really interesting about our nature as people, when we want to be private and when we want community. We are desperate for connection, and yet so often we end up feeling alone, particularly in big cities, so I wanted to write about that."" Spin offs: A brief history Some of the biggest shows in TV history were spin-offs. The hugely successful Frasier lasted for 11 seasons and notched up 264 episodes - just behind its predecessor Cheers, which managed 270. Happy Days had a whopping seven spin-offs. The most successful were Mork & Mindy and Laverne & Shirley. More recently, the Emmy-nominated Better Call Saul launched in 2015 as a spin-off from Breaking Bad, and was created by the same team - Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould. Young Sheldon is still going three years after it debuted as an examination of the childhood of The Big Bang Theory's lead character. But others have been distinctly less popular. Friends spin-off Joey lasted just two seasons and failed to match the phenomenal popularity of its predecessor. And the less said about Only Fools And Horses spin-off Green Green Grass, the better. Life is appropriately named, as the series covers birth, death, marriage, infidelity and mental health. The series launches with the arrival of Belle's teenage niece, who is quite a handful, to put it mildly. ""Her niece comes into her life like a whirlwind, and one of the things that Belle has always ended up doing is looking after other people, taking their problems on board and being the person that copes with stuff,"" Hamilton explains. ""So you watch her try to cope with all of these people and essentially try to carry all of their problems for them, at the same time as being less than honest about how huge her own demons are."" But each character in the show has their own inner battles - which is a reflection of real life, says Lester, who plays David: ""Everyone is going through some unique, incredibly profound, heart-breaking situations, and it's great to be part of a show that explores that."" Steadman's character Gail finds herself re-evaluating things as she approaches a major birthday. ""Here was a woman who had been happily married for all these years, lovely home, two kids, and everything seemed fine, but suddenly she looks at her life again, at the age of 70,"" she says. ""Normally people look at their lives again at the age of 50 or 60, but at 70? To suddenly say 'hmm' and re-appraise it, that seemed interesting and challenging."" The fourth main character is Hannah, played by Melissa Johns. ""In episode one, Hannah is heavily pregnant, and the father of her baby is Andy, who she had a one night stand with eight months previous,"" she explains. ""I think the term is entanglement - you know, like Jada Pinkett Smith and August [Alsina],"" jokes her co-star Calvin Demba, referring to one recent high-profile affair. In the absence of a third series of Doctor Foster, Bartlett felt there was potential to explore and develop the character of Anna, but also make a drama which struck a different tone. ""I'd written a lot of quite heavy things,"" he says. ""Doctor Foster goes to very dark places, and this show goes to very dark places too, but what I felt I hadn't seen enough of was a show that allowed us to see the strength that people have, the kindness, the goodness. ""A show that really took a group of characters through some of the toughest stuff that everybody has to face in life, and saw how they dealt with it.""

"By Vincent DowdArts correspondent, BBC News Name recognition for The Wolf of Wall Street probably comes mainly from the 2013 film with Leonardo DiCaprio. But the man who now has to make the story work with live actors points out the show he's written and directed has nothing to do with the movie. Alexander Wright says he believed the story would make great immersive drama. ""This isn't a show where you sit in a seat for two hours. When you walk in you're treated as a new employee on Day One at the stockbrokers Stratton Oakmont. There's going to be immediate interaction with actors cast as other employees. ""And you soon realise you've turned up on a big day: the firm's handling the massive IPO (Initial Public Offering) for [fashion designer] Steve Madden shoes. That's where the story starts."" In real life the brokerage firm Stratton Oakmont, run by Belfort, took Madden public in 1993. Belfort was later indicted for securities fraud and given a four-year sentence. Wright's cast of 20 has recreated a multi-layered slice of New York life in a terrace of houses behind Liverpool Street Station. The space is due to become a boutique hotel next year. The location is close to major City of London employers such as Deutsche Bank and UBS; Wright knew he wanted a location in the financial district rather than an established theatre. After an initial briefing, audience members face the kind of options common to many immersive shows. At certain points they choose which storyline to follow as Stratton Oakmont first booms and then crumbles. You can remain a devoted Strattonite or take an interest in how FBI agents build their case against the firm. And if you prefer, you can focus on the tense home life of Belfort (played by Oliver Tilney), his wife Nadine (played by Rhiannon Harper-Rafferty) and young daughter Chandler. Harper-Rafferty is appearing in her first immersive show. ""What I really like is the access you get to the audience. Physically they're very close so you see what is affecting them. But they can also morph what's happening in the action - it's two-way. ""There are moments when, if I feel it's going to work, I ask the audience for advice about the strains in the family. The reply is often that I should leave Jordan - though a couple of days ago someone asked why doesn't he just take his money and retire? ""There's a scene at home celebrating Chandler's seventh birthday. It's like the audience becomes part of our group and you can feel them trying to protect the Chandler character. An audience member may stand in the wrong place or maybe make an unexpected comment out loud. But if that comes from an emotional place it can actually help."" Tilney also took the central role in Wright's immersive version of The Great Gatsby. ""This is still a relatively new form and we're learning all the time how it works. Sometimes immersive theatre can be free form, where the audience goes wherever it wants. Or there's a promenade experience where you might go fairly strictly from A to B to C. ""I would say The Wolf of Wall Street sits somewhere in between: audience members have a choice of where to go but we talk about 'tracks' which pretty much guide the audience through the narrative. ""More inquisitive people can peel off and follow a different strand of the story - and sometimes it's useful for us if we invite them to do so. That can work if an audience member is in some way interesting or is asking particular questions. They may end up learning something which others don't or having a particular experience. We call those Easter eggs."" The play retains the original 1990s setting. Wright says today's City workers, with so many nearby, may find parallels with recent events in the world of finance. ""It'll be really interesting to sit with them in the bar after the show and talk about what resonates today and what's more from 90s business culture. But if it starts as a story about stocks and banks and money and excess it becomes a story about people. The last thing we want to be is preachy."" Audience members need to accept a certain amount of shepherding from one space to the next. Attentive production staff wrangle them with a firm touch. There are quite a lot of stairs and swear words. Wright says structuring Gatsby gave him valuable experience to help make the new show work. ""The immersive industry attracts a varied audience which has grown but also the character has developed. Wolf is getting people in who wouldn't dream normally of going to the theatre - in some cases theatre would be their nightmare evening out. So that's a whole new audience. ""But also we've definitely seen people come over from traditional theatre to give immersive a try. They might be people who would go to the National Theatre or to the West End. We're now seeing families and tourists turn up and I don't think immersive is seen as purely a fringe thing any more. ""There are parts of the show which are very funny. But there are elements of tragedy too - Jordan flies high but he crashes to earth. It's like a great classic King Lear: it all comes down to ambition and relationships and people making mistakes and having to decide what matters to them and the damage they do along the way to everyone around them - even to people they love. ""We have an incredibly complex but rigid show plan about what needs to happen when. We have worked out exactly how the audience will journey through the action. But hopefully the audience isn't aware of that at all. What matters are the characters and how they interact - it's ultimately what keeps people watching."" The Wolf of Wall Street is playing at Stratton Oakmont Inc. on Sun Street in London.",Six years ago the film The Wolf of Wall Street was a box-office hit for Martin Scorsese. But it started with a book by Jordan Belfort describing his rise as a young New York stockbroker - and how everything then came tumbling down. Now the book's been adapted as a live immersive experience in London.

"He was one of the most popular artists of his time, topping the record charts, filling theatres and starring on TV. An old-fashioned variety performer with his roots in music hall, he added a unique dash of surrealism to his act, Even allegations of tax fraud failed to diminish his standing with his adoring public. Kenneth Arthur Dodd was born on 8 November 1927 in the Liverpool suburb of Knotty Ash, the son of a coal merchant. His birthplace would play a central part in his later stage show as he wove surreal tales around Knotty Ash and its inhabitants the Diddy people, with their jam butty mines and black pudding plantation. As a child he showed an early talent for clowning but without any thought of making it a career. However one prank went wrong when he tried riding his bike with his eyes closed and sustained injuries to his mouth that resulted in his distinctive toothy appearance. Despite getting a scholarship to grammar school, he left at 14 and got himself a little cart with which he went round the outskirts of Liverpool, selling pots and pans. As he used to say in later years: ""If you can sell pots and pans to housewives on their washing day, you can sell anything, even jokes."" But the stage beckoned and, after sending off for a book on how to be a ventriloquist, he set out to entertain the public in local clubs and halls with a dummy given to him by his father. He served a long apprenticeship as an amateur performer before making his first professional appearance as Professor Yaffle Chucklebutty, Operatic Tenor and Sausage Knotter, in Nottingham in 1954. ""At least they didn't boo me off,"" he later recalled. Little black notebooks A year later he appeared in Blackpool, and by 1958 had gained top billing in the seaside resort which has been the making - and sometimes breaking - of a host of variety acts. During the next decade he gained a steadily-increasing reputation in the northern music halls, and became well known to a wider public for his broadcasts and his recordings of popular songs, like 'Happiness'. But his debut in the West End of London was deferred until 1965, when he topped the bill at the Palladium in an extraordinarily successful 42-week run. In the same year, he topped the charts with 'Tears'. Ken Dodd was devoted to his work, and seldom, if ever, took a holiday. He recorded all his jokes - and the public reaction to them - in a series of little black notebooks, and rehearsed and re-rehearsed his every word and gesture. Set down in print, much of his material may seem commonplace. It was the way he put it across that counted. Possibility of disgrace Uttered by him, a phrase such as ""Good Morning"" became charged with outrageous innuendo, and - backed by appropriate pantomime - would throw an audience into paroxysms of laughter. Dodd's catchphrases, most famously ""How tickled I am!"", were quoted everywhere. At a Liverpool theatre in 1974 he told jokes at a rate of 10 a minute for more than three hours - a feat that gained him a place in the Guinness Book of Records. Throughout the 1970s and 80s he was a firm favourite on television and radio, and kept up a punishing schedule of stage appearances. But in 1989, Ken Dodd faced the possibility of disgrace, when he stood trial at Liverpool Crown Court on eight charges of tax fraud spanning a period of 15 years and involving £825,000. The trial abounded with stories of his eccentricity. He had claimed to live on £3,500 a year, while his personal wealth ran into millions, and he did not take a holiday until he was 51. It also emerged that he had 20 bank accounts in Jersey and the Isle of Man, and made regular 'cash and carry' flights to deposit money in them which was not declared to the Inland Revenue. Private man He also had £336,000 hidden in wardrobes, cupboards and under stairs. The jury was swayed by Dodd's defence counsel George Carman QC, who remarked: ""Some accountants are comedians but comedians are never accountants"". Dodd was acquitted, although he faced a reported £2m bill for legal fees and tax he had previously promised to pay. He took up his career again and later made light of his court ordeal, quipping ""I told the Inland Revenue I didn't owe them a penny because I lived near the seaside."" He had another season at the London Palladium in 1990, and was given a British Comedy Lifetime Achievement Award and voted Top Variety Performer in 1993. And the TV special, An Audience With Ken Dodd, proved a huge hit, showcasing Dodd's comic brilliance for a younger audience. He was still touring in his ninth decade with his shows sometimes lasting into the early hours of the morning. ""Some of you are optimists,"" he'd tell his audience at the start of a show, ""you've booked your taxis for half-past 12 But they say the breakfast here is good."" Behind the banter Ken Dodd was a private man, and a serious student of comic theory. As he once put it: ""Freud said that laughter is the outward expression of the psyche. But Freud never had to play the Glasgow Empire."" He rejected suggestions that many of his gags, particularly those revolving around blondes, were sexist. ""I think in every comedian there is a streak of anarchy. We don't take kindly to people telling us what we should say. But I don't like vulgarity and obscenity - the great comedians never did anything like that, they didn't need to."" Dodd married his partner of 40 years, Anne Jones, two days before he died. Although the pair had a lengthy engagement, Jones - a singer, pianist and flautist - was the support act on his tour. In December 2016, to the delight of his legions of fans, it was announced that Doddy was to be awarded a knighthood in the New Year Honours. Ken Dodd was the UK's last great music hall entertainer, from an age when comedians trudged from venue to venue plying their trade of laughter. ""My job,"" he once told the Daily Telegraph, "" isn't to educate people or even do politics, I've got to make people feel good, I want to make them happy.""","His swept-up hair, protruding teeth and expression of lunatic bewilderment made Sir Ken Dodd one of Britain's most recognisable entertainers."
"Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, the star of Line of Duty, The Irishman and This Is England said he ""didn't know how to cope"" at the time. The ordeal came about after he had left home to go to drama school in London. The 46-year-old said a series of traumatic family events that occurred before he moved away from home for the first time contributed to his collapse. In the space of a few years, his beloved grandmother died and his mother gave birth to a stillborn child. ""I'd been through these few traumatic things and never really grieved,"" said the Liverpudlian actor. His mother later became pregnant again and a baby brother arrived the day before Graham, then 20, went to start his new life in the capital. ""This beautiful joyous occasion of this little boy coming into my life and mum and pop's life and then me having to leave was kind of a bit difficult,"" he told host Lauren Laverne. ""But when you're 20 you have the world in front of you haven't you, so you try not to focus on that stuff."" He added: ""I had a breakdown with all of these things that had happened traumatically from my late teens that I hadn't really dealt with or I hadn't come to terms with."" The star recalled how he returned home and tried to explain his feelings to his parents, who tried to help him, but in vain. He went on to attempt to hang himself in his room. ""It was very calculated,"" he said. ""I heard my nanna's voice - and I know it sounds strange and weird... and she shouted 'Stephen' and I thought I'd gone, because I'd tried to do that. And I just came to, I opened my eyes and the rope had snapped, thankfully. ""And then I put a high neck jumper on, one of them zip-up jumpers, and my ma and da came back and then my mum kind of saw it and she went, 'What's that?' And she seen it properly and then the three of us... I really opened up then, everything just came out and I just [said], 'I don't know how to cope.' His best friends Lee and Jamie were ""magnificent"", he said. ""They were really supportive and my mum and dad and slowly built me back, slowly come around to the understanding it was OK. Life was worth living, thankfully."" Graham also spoke about how he first attended a youth theatre group at Liverpool's Everyman theatre as a teenager on the advice of local actor Andrew Schofield, who lived over the road from his grandmother. One of Graham's grandfathers was Jamaican, and he told Laverne that at times in his youth he didn't know where he ""belonged"". ""There were times there growing up when I was slightly unsure where I fitted in,"" he said, referencing his white and black cousins. He stressed that his parents encouraged him ""to find my own way within it"". He can now be seen playing mobster Anthony Provenzano in Martin Scorsese's film The Irishman. The director had previously cast him in Gangs of New York and as Al Capone in HBO's Boardwalk Empire. Graham admitted he was ""really nervous"" to meet Robert De Niro, his co-star in The Irishman, because movies like The Godfather, Taxi Driver and The Deer Hunter were ""the films that I grew up on"". His dad showed them to him on video straight after he confessed to having a proper interest in acting. ""That weekend we watched those three films, and I think we watched The Godfather twice actually. It was amazing,"" he recalled. ""But that was that kind of a moment where he went to me, 'If you're serious, this is how it's done, seriously and brilliantly.' That began my love affair with films.""

Fellow headline act Duran Duran started their set with 1980's hits Planet Earth as they performed second on the bill, representing England. John Taylor from the band told the BBC: ""We feel very English. But we feel British too, so we're in the right place."" Singer Simon Le Bon, who performed in a union jack themed jacket, called the gig ""amazing"" and said it was ""the biggest show we've ever played in London town"". Bandmate Nick Rhodes added: ""It's the last day of the European tour and it's the first day of the Olympics. What more could you ask for?""

""To go fly the flag for your country makes it even sweeter,"" he added. Welsh rockers Stereophonics played four small warm-up shows around the UK this week in preparation for their set. Speaking to the BBC before going on stage singer Kelly Jones said it was great to get the opportunity to ""fly the dragon"" on behalf of their home nation. ""We are very happy to be here, it's brilliant to be representing Wales and to be part of such a big event,"" he said. ""It's not every day that the Olympics comes to your country.""

"It co-stars Tom Hanks as Walt Disney, in the story of Disney's long battle to buy the rights to the much-loved book, which was eventually turned into a musical starring Julie Andrews in 1964. Directed by The Blind Side's John Lee Hancock, the film takes us back into Travers' troubled childhood using frequent flashbacks to the Australian outback where she grew up. Saving Mr Banks is released on 29 November, but here is what the critics have been making of it: Kate Muir - The Times - 4 stars Emma Thompson plays Mrs Travers, in a mesmerising and droll performance. Tom Hanks takes on the role of Disney, with a nailbrush moustache and unexpectedly gentle charm, his upbeat American optimism making Mrs Travers fit to burst with outrage in her buttoned-up tweed suit. Disney's relentlessly cheerful campaign to charm her is a delight to watch, as is our knowing take on lines such as 'Dick Van Dyke? A horrid idea'. In all a charming comedy. Apart from the dancing penguins of course, which Mrs Travers loathed. Read the full review here (subscription). The Independent - 2 stars The film is effective enough as a weepie. It boasts a fine performance from Thompson, who starts the movie in eccentric groove like a prickly version of Joyce Grenfell's Miss Gossage, but slowly and subtly reveals her character's vulnerabilities and complexities. However, Saving Mr. Banks also feels sanitised and disingenuous. Although the idea was initially developed by BBC Films, this is the Disney version of how Disney made Mary Poppins. Saving Mr. Banks is more a character study than a behind-the-scenes drama. Travers' character is rich and complex. The problem is that Hanks's Disney seems like a whitewash. Read the full review here. Peter Bradshaw - The Guardian - 3 stars An enormous spoonful of sugar and the tiniest bit of medicine: it all goes down, just about. This is a warmly, in fact outrageously sentimental and self-congratulatory film from Disney about the master himself. Only a Disney film would have had the rights to the Mary Poppins clips and only a Disney film would have been permitted the possible lese-majesty of representing the great man on screen. Saving Mr Banks is an indulgent, overlong picture which is always on the verge of becoming a mess. Thankfully, reliable old Tom Hanks snaps his fingers and - spit, spot - everything more or less gets cleared away. Read the full review here. David Gritten - The Telegraph - 4 stars This clash (between Travers and Disney), with some of the real-life antagonism glossed over, has been reworked into a cat-and-mouse game that often resembles a seduction. Obviously, this gets played for laughs - many of them good ones. No opportunity is lost to highlight the differences in world-view between these two. But it's Thompson as the heroically unbiddable Travers who makes the most of it; her bravura performance effectively dominates the film. Pitching her delivery somewhere between Nanny McPhee and Miss Jean Brodie, Thompson perfectly embodies Travers's air of disapproval and distaste. Read the full review here . Scott Foundas - Variety Somewhere, Uncle Walt is smiling. Thick with affection for Hollywood's most literal ""dream factory"" and wry in its depiction of the studio filmmaking process, director John Lee Hancock's (film) should earn far more than tuppence from holiday audiences - and from awards voters who can scarcely resist this sort of mash note to the magic of movies (eg Argo, The Artist). If 2007's Enchanted remains undisputed as the great, impish, postmodern riff on Disney iconography, Saving Mr Banks is the unapologetically retro valentine Disney himself might have made. It's a bit square, never particularly surprising, yet very rich in its sense of creative people and their spirit of self-reinvention - the Outback girl refashioned as a prim and proper British lady, the Missouri farm boy who turned himself into a cross between Peter Pan and the Wizard of Oz. Read the full review here. Leslie Felperin - The Hollywood Reporter In a part once mooted for Meryl Streep, Emma Thompson takes charge of the central role of the waspish PL Travers with an authority that makes you wonder how anybody else could ever have been considered. The twinkly-eyed, avuncular figure incarnated by a mustachioed Hanks - who only for a fleeting moment shows off a glower worthy of a mafia crime boss ordering a hit - couldn't be further from the negative analyses of Disney depicted in, say, Richard Schickel's scathing biography The Disney Version or the recent Philip Glass opera The Perfect American. Some will no doubt call this a whitewash, but Saving Mr. Banks presents a grittier version of Disney than one might have expected 10 or even five years ago... Heck, they even show him smoking, and that's way worse than being an FBI informant these days.

The footage was filmed by a bystander on a mobile phone. About half of the complaints were about ITV News, which was the first to broadcast the footage on its 18.30 BST bulletin on 22 May. The regulator is looking into whether the broadcasters breached two rules. The first rule states that children must be protected by appropriate scheduling from unsuitable material. The second rule looks into whether broadcasting material which may cause offence is justified by the context. This includes ""the effect of the material on viewers or listeners who may come across it unawares"".

"The watchdog has received 419 complaints about remarks he made on ITV's This Morning on Monday. He cast doubt on media reports refuting the myth that 5G causes the virus ""when they don't know it's not true"". On Tuesday he said there's no link, but that many are ""looking for answers and that's simply what I was trying to do"". The theory linking coronavirus with 5G - which is used in mobile phone networks and uses signals carried by radio waves - has led a number of phone masts to be set alight or vandalised. Holmes made his original remarks in a segment with the programme's consumer editor Alice Beer, who dismissed the theory as ""not true and it's incredibly stupid"". 'State narrative' Holmes told her: ""I totally agree with everything you are saying but what I don't accept is mainstream media immediately slapping that down as not true when they don't know it's not true. ""No-one should attack or damage or do anything like that, but it's very easy to say it is not true because it suits the state narrative. That's all I would say, as someone with an inquiring mind."" He was criticised on social media and by scientists who have dismissed the theories as ""complete rubbish"". On Tuesday, an Ofcom spokesperson said: ""We are assessing this programme in full as a priority."" Ofcom assesses all complaints to decide whether to launch a full investigation, and is prioritising cases relating to potentially harmful or inaccurate information about coronavirus. Eamonn Holmes' new statement in full Speaking on Tuesday's programme, the presenter told viewers: ""I want to clarify some comments that some of you may have misinterpreted from me yesterday, around conspiracy theories and coronavirus and this involved the roll-out of 5G. ""Both Alice Beer and I agreed in a discussion on this very programme on fake news that it's not true and there is no connection between the present national health emergency and 5G, and to suggest otherwise would be wrong and indeed it could be dangerous. ""Every theory relating to such a connection has been proven to be false and we would like to emphasise that. ""However many people are rightly concerned and are looking for answers and that's simply what I was trying to do, to impart yesterday. ""But for the avoidance of any doubt I want to make it completely clear there's no scientific evidence to substantiate any of those 5G theories. I hope that clears that up."" ITV declined to comment further. Responding to the host's original comments on Monday, Dr Simon Clarke, associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, said: ""The opinions of the mainstream media or the state hardly come into the debate. ""Numerous doctors and scientists around the world have said that the disease is caused by a virus, something completely different to a mobile phone signal."" Beer reiterated her view that ""the 5G conspiracy theory is nonsense and should be quashed"". The prime minister's spokesman did not respond directly to Holmes' comments but said the 5G theory was ""complete nonsense"". He added: ""We are working with social media companies to make sure these entirely bogus claims are not circulated."" Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

"Sony Pictures told China's Southern Metropolis Daily the director had agreed to the ""slight adjustments"". Zhang Miao said changes included ""tuning the blood to a darker colour"" and ""lowering the height of the splatter of blood"". However he added it would not affect the overall quality of the film. Zhang said the director viewed the changes as ""progress rather than a compromise"". ""What we call bloodshed and violence is just a means of serving the purpose of the film,"" he said. ""Quentin knew how to adjust that, and it's necessary that he is the one to do it."" Despite the adjustments, Tarantino's Oscar-winning slavery epic will keep its full running time of 165 minutes. It is the first of the director's films to be cleared for release in China where sexually explicit scenes, violence and other topics deemed inappropriate are often deleted by state censors. Other Hollywood films including Skyfall, Cloud Atlas and the remake of Red Dawn, have all recently made changes to appease regulators. China became the world's second-biggest movie market in March, with box office revenues surging in 2012 to $2.7bn (£1.8bn).","Bloody scenes from Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained are to be toned down for its cinema release in China, according to the film's distributors."
"The star has won performance of the year at the Rose d'Or Awards, which recognise TV from across the globe. That came a day after he was named best actor at the Scottish Bafta Awards. The virtual Rose d'Or ceremony also saw Sex Education win the comedy drama and sitcom award. Gatwa said it was an ""incredible honour"" to win his prize, adding that it felt ""very humbling"". The 28-year-old continued: ""There has been so much incredible TV and performances this past year, I feel very undeserving of this. ""It's really special to receive this because just before I got Sex Education, I was going to quit acting, and so the show that's empowered me, it feels really special that it's out there empowering other people."" Gatwa, who moved to Scotland as a toddler when his family fled the Rwandan genocide, was also nominated for a Bafta TV Award earlier this year, and was named on The Hollywood Reporter's list of Rising Young Stars last month. Normal People actress Daisy Edgar-Jones received the Rose d'Or's emerging talent award, while Sir David Attenborough, 94, was presented with a lifetime achievement honour. Accepting his accolade, Sir David said television had taught people a lot about the natural world since he began his career, and it was ""essential that we know about it and we know how it works, and we understand why it is that we are damaging it so badly"". The Rose d'Or Awards were founded in 1961. Other British winners this year included James Corden, whose Homefest concert won the new prize for Innovation In The Time Of Covid. BBC Two's Once Upon A Time In Iraq won both the documentary award and the Golden Rose, and Channel 4's The School That Tried To End Racism won best reality and factual entertainment programme. BBC Radio 4's Tunnel 29 won the audio award. Shows from the USA, Germany, Argentina, France and Australia were among the other winners.

"By Paul GlynnEntertainment & arts reporter The Yorkshireman has more Spotify streams than the other nine artists on the longlist combined, thanks to his energetic blend of emo, rock, rap and pop. His fans, who call themselves ""The Black Hearts Club"", span the globe, with the singer playing around 250 gigs in 26 countries over the last two years. The 22-year-old's live following translated into chart success in October, with an EP dedicated to his fans, The Underrated Youth, reaching the UK's top 10 (one week earlier and the chart position would have rendered him ineligible for the Sound of 2020). But with his star rising at such a rapid rate, does Yungblud - whose real name is Dominic Harrison - even require such recognition? ""I don't really look at it like that, man,"" he tells us down the line from Los Angeles, just before Christmas. ""We were so surprised [to be named], I couldn't believe what was happening at all."" In fact, the singer seems taken aback that his songs, which tackle topics like anxiety, sexual assault and corporate greed, are getting mainstream acceptance. ""Someone came up to me at some industry event the other night right and goes, 'What's the secret? What's the formula?' ""And I'm like, 'I don't actually know what you're talking about. You're speaking to the wrong person if you want that'."" He adds: ""I get up everyday and all I'm doing is, like, talking about things and people are listening and talking to me back. That's the only thing I can explain. ""I think looking at charts and things, it's kind of a little bit irrelevant to me. I'm not arsed about having people go, 'Oh Yungblud, he had a good couple of songs, didn't he?' ""When people look back on us in 10 years, I want them to be like, 'They were a movement and they did something that was that was completely original and a liberation within people'."" 'Undeniable fanbases' Yungblud is the grandson of Rick Harrison, who played with T Rex in the 1970s, but his sights are set on making anthems that speak to his own generation; stamping out the ""sterile material"" of what he brands as ""The X-Factor age"". The ambitious young showman has already been described as an ""icon"" for the UK's suburban youth, and a ""relentless"" and ""infectious"" live performer - who is unapologetically ""androgynous"" and ""over-the-top"". He's also recently opened up about his fluid sexuality and how having ADHD informs his music. And while the London-based Doncastrian finds inspiration in the collective rebellion of the early '90s Seattle grunge scene, thanks to bands like Nirvana and Soundgarden, he's hoping to replicate the more recent success of one of his US contemporaries. ""People are angry again, people are riled up and want to be told the truth,"" he says. ""I think that's why Billie Eilish is the biggest artist in the world right now, because she was just a 16-year-old kid just telling the truth. ""It's just undeniable fanbases. Build a fanbase, build a culture, make people make people feel like it's alright to be who they are - and then the rest will follow."" Yungblud was chosen for the BBC Sound of 2020 list by a panel of 170 music critics, broadcasters, festival bookers and previous nominees - including Lewis Capaldi, Chvrches and Billie Eilish. The top five were: 1.Celeste 2.Easy Life 3.Yungblud 4.Joy Crookes 5.Inhaler What was your initial reaction when you heard you'd made the class of 2020? ""What is going on right now? I'm walking down Venice Beach, California and I'm on the BBC Sound of list!"" I've seen artists like [2015 runner-up] James Bay on there when he was popping in the UK and it's just kind of mental to get that nod. You work hard as an artist and you build a culture. My head has been down in my fanbase, building my community, travelling the world and I never really look above the water. And if you lift your head above the water for a minute and you look around and go, ""We just played to a sold out Brixton Academy and we're on the Sound of list"", it's like, ""What?!"" Your fans are clearly central to everything you do. What is it that they tell you they want? Everybody wants to be loved for exactly who they are, not something they need to be. People don't want to fit moulds anymore and be manipulated into boxes, because it's just uncomfortable. Do you still see that sort of thing going on? Absolutely. The most important thing for me is the stories I hear. For example a girl comes up to me in Nijmegen, Holland and gives me a note that says - ""I left school, ran away from home and shaved my head, and then went to art school and now I'm a graphic designer, thanks to a girl I met at one of your shows, who brought me into the community"". Or I see two boys from Bristol snog before the mosh pit swallows them up. And I talk to a 35-year-old dude in Glasgow who lost his wife and kid last year and he used to listen to the music in the car and for some reason it doesn't make him sad, it takes him back to a place when things were alright. For me, man, that's real and that's what we're here for. It's not me, man, it's us. And if it ever becomes [just about] me it's all flawed. Last year your EP went to number six in the album charts, you toured the world, played festivals like Reading + Leeds, and you also had a famous pop star girlfriend [US singer Halsey]. Is this rock 'n' roll star life how you imagined it would be? I've done so much living in the past year and the next album is about all this stuff. We blew up all over the world, I fell in love and fell out of love. I nearly lost my mum and I got really depressed for a bit and I came out of that, but when I look back on last year... I wrote a song the other night called A Weird Time Of Life and it's going to be on the record. It's been a weird time of life but the best time of life and I wouldn't change it. Yungblud is a coming of age thing, but you're growing up until you shut your eyes for good. Recently you've curated a few playlists for Radio 1, which gave us an insight into your eclectic range of influences - from rock to rap and beyond. Who are you digging the most right now? I think right now Travis Scott is as relevant in rock and roll music as Marilyn Manson is. It's just a different type of music. Rock and roll ain't four idiots banging the hell out their instruments. Rock and roll means freedom to me - and someone like Travis Scott is pouring petrol on the fire that's already in young people's tummies. I've got to that phase in life where people are trying to pitch songs to me and it's so funny seeing a songwriter's version of what they think Yungblud is and it's all rock and bratty and I'm like, ""No I've left that behind"". I've grown up now. It's a lot more emotional. But there's some mental collaborations [coming up]. I love collaborating - it's tapping into cultures I never normally would. So you've told us what your fans want, but what do you want from 2020? The best songs I've ever written are going to come out, and we're doing five nights at [London's] Kentish Town Forum. I'm just building it, taking it one fan at a time because there are still people out there who feel like it's not OK to be who they are. And I don't want people to feel like that, as I've felt like that... Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

"By Mark SavageEntertainment reporter Chris Evans - a classic car nut and speed freak - has already ruled himself out of the running, but here are some of the people producers may (or may not) be considering. Jodie Kidd Model Jodie Kidd is a former racing driver who currently presents The Classic Car Show on Channel 5. ""I've always liked everything high-octane,"" she told The Express last year - and, true to her word, she once held the pole position on Top Gear's ""Star In A Reasonably Priced Car"" leaderboard, completing her circuit in 1 minute, 48 seconds. As a friend of the programme - she also took part in 2010's Ashes Special - she is likely to be high on the producers' wishlist. But last year, she ruled out a permanent role on the show: ""I couldn't join those boys. No, God no,"" she told the Radio Times. On Red Nose Day, affable comedian John Bishop was among the first to lampoon Jeremy Clarkson over his suspension. Imploring viewers to send money to poverty-stricken children in Uganda, he said: ""I'm not saying I'll punch someone over food - that's Jeremy Clarkson's job."" The star's irreverent humour, combined with an eye for telling detail, make him a perfect fit for Top Gear's shaggy dog storytelling. The show's endurance challenges won't pose a problem - he once cycled overland from Australia to Liverpool to raise money for the NSPCC. And he's another high achiever in a Reasonably Priced Car. His lap time, driving a Kia Cee'd, was 1 minute, 42.8 seconds. Suzi Perry has been covering Formula 1 since 2013. Before that she was the BBC's MotoGP motorcycle racing correspondent for 13 years. She undoubtedly knows her stuff - and, it transpires, she's been asked to host the show before. ""Years ago, when TV was about to bring Top Gear back and rebrand it with Jeremy, James [May] and Richard [Hammond], I sat down and talked to Andy Wilman, the series producer, about joining them,"" she told the Telegraph last year. ""I remember thinking, 'I might be out of my depth and it might not be a good idea', instead of grabbing the opportunity. ""Looking back, I may have made a large error, but it's not like I didn't work for the next 15 years. I don't regret it - but it was probably a bad decision."" Recently released from his ITV contract, Adrian Chiles is undoubtedly looking for a new, high-profile TV job. A hugely talented sports broadcaster, he is better known for football punditry than his knowledge of cars - but he once spent a day shadowing motor racing boss Eddie Jordan for a BBC documentary. His everyman style and droll sense of humour would be a good fit for Top Gear - but BBC bosses will note that Chiles was once forced to apologise by ITV after implying Polish football supporters were all builders. Given Top Gear's track record, though, that might be considered a qualification. When most of her peers were obsessing over Duran Duran, Vicki Butler Henderson fell in love with a Volkswagen Golf GTI MkII. She began racing 100cc karts at the age of 12 and was overtaken by David Coulthard in her first race. But she also went on to became the first women ever to win a Maserati race, in 2002. A former road Tester at What Car? magazine, she made regular appearances on Top Gear before jumping ship to work as a presenter on Channel 5's Fifth Gear. Butler-Henderson counts Jeremy Clarkson as a friend, meaning he may put in a good word for her with Top Gear's producers. He heaped praise on her driving skills after racing her in 2010. ""I was in an Aston Martin DBS convertible. She was in a Ferrari California and we had most of Silverstone to play with. By rights, I should have kicked her arse. I had four more cylinders, a million more horsepowers and two more testicles. I didn't though. I couldn't even get close. Yes, he ruled himself out - but that was before Clarkson was sacked. The BBC Radio 2 presenter is a self-confessed petrolhead, who has one of the most prestigious car collections in Britain. Among his previous purchases is a £12 million 1963 Ferrari 250GTO. He's also admitted that he'd be a good fit for Top Gear, telling his breakfast show audience: ""From what I've seen on Twitter and various social media, there's a 50/50 split approximately as to whether me being involved in the show is a good idea. ""In TV or radio, if you get a 50/50 love/hate reaction that usually equals massive hit. I used to work for [ratings body] Barb and knock on people's doors and this was the rule of thumb. ""However, I'm in the 'no' camp. So regardless of whether it would be a hit, I'm voting a no for myself on that show, so that's never going happen."" No doubt the BBC will try to change his mind over the next few months. When Clarkson was suspended, a petition to have Alan Partridge installed as his successor attracted thousands of signatures. Partridge drove a Rover 800 - and wore a Castrol GTX jacket to a funeral - but his real-life alter-ego, comedian Steve Coogan, is a serious car enthusiast. He once owned a £100,000 Ferrari, but used it so little he admitted that ""for a round trip from Brighton to Manchester and back it would have been cheaper to hire a twin-engined light aircraft"". However, he is not a fan of Top Gear's humour. ""If I say anything remotely racist or sexist as Alan Partridge, for example, the joke is abundantly clear. We are laughing at a lack of judgment and ignorance,"" he wrote in The Observer four years ago. ""With Top Gear it is three rich, middle-aged men laughing at poor Mexicans."" The list of potential candidates is long and exhaustive. Former racing drivers Tiff Needell, Eddie Irvine and Eddie Jordan are all being tipped by bookmakers, as are London Mayor Boris Johnson and Jamiroquai singer Jay Kay. X Factor presenter Dermot O'Leary, owner of a classic 1968 Volkswagen Karmann Ghia, has also been mooted for the job, as have Geordie duo Ant and Dec. Charismatic motorcycle racer Guy Martin is considered a fan favourite. He previously presented a series on land speed records for Channel 4 - which saw him set a new world sledge speed record of 83.5 mph. Rowan Atkinson - who is currently the second-fastest ""Star In A Reasonably Priced Car"" at 1 minute, 42.2 seconds - is another contender, although the BBC may struggle to insure him. The Blackadder star is responsible for the UK's biggest ever car insurance payout. It cost his insurance company £910,000 to repair his 240mph McLaren F1, after he crashed it into a tree in 2011.",The BBC has confirmed Top Gear will return in 2016 without Jeremy Clarkson - but who is likely to fill his leather brogues?
"The actor was asked by Australian morning TV show sunrise if there was any truth to the rumours about a sequel to the 1986 military action film. ""It's true, it's true,"" he replied. ""I'm going to start filming it probably in the next year. It's happening."" The original film launched Cruise's career and took more than $350m (£270m) globally at the box office. The actor played the cocky pilot Maverick in the movie, one of the top students at a US training camp for elite military fighter pilots. The film also starred Val Kilmer, Tim Robbins, Meg Ryan, Tom Skerrit and Kelly McGillis.

"By Shamaan Freeman-PowellBBC News The 31-year-old south Londoner began writing at school, printing out poems, stapling them together, and charging classmates £2 for a copy. More than a decade later, Jay, who self-describes as non-binary, has won the 2018 Ted Hughes Award for Surge: Side A, an exploration of the New Cross Fire in 1981 - which killed 13 young black people in south-east London. Jay's poetry is personal and explores identity, politics, and what it means to be young and black in Britain. According to Susannah Herbert of Forward Arts Foundation, which runs National Poetry Day and the Forward Prizes for Poetry, Jay is part of the changing face of poetry. Ten or 15 years ago, Susannah says, the major UK publishers and booksellers knew little about the poetry audience and tended to assume ""real"" poetry was highbrow, niche, and plainly presented with no pictures or introductions. But last year poetry book sales increased by £1.3m - and two-thirds of buyers were younger than 34, according to statistics from Nielsen BookScan. Susannah believes the increase in poetry sales is linked to changing attitudes towards sexuality, race and gender - forcing poetry, like many other industries, to become more relatable. ""Social media has changed this: now that we can track poetry shares and likes, we can see a huge, mass, need for words that matter, words that touch on truth,"" she says. ""So when news footage of the black, non-binary, Danez Smith reading Dear White America gets viewed 300,000 times on YouTube in 24 hours, it makes immediate sense for a long-established publisher like Chatto & Windus to publish them."" According to Susannah, 30 years ago poets from black and other ethnic-minority backgrounds were virtually invisible. She says that, before social media, ""a handful of middle-aged men in high places set the tone, publishing poetry they liked to read and, often, to write themselves"". Jay agrees: ""At one stage in the UK, if you knew about poetry it was probably because you had an elitist education, and people have started to challenge that. ""They now want to see an open and democratic approach to poetry."" Arrival By Jay Bernard, coming from the forthcoming collection Surge, published by Chatto and Windus in June (poem contains language some may find offensive). remember we were brought here from the clear waters of our dreams that we might be named, numbered and forgotten that we were made visible that we might be looked on with contempt that they gave us their first and last names that we might be called wogs and to their minds made flesh that it might be stripped from our backs kept hungry that we might cry in our children's sleep close our smokey mouths around their dreams swallow them as they gaze upon us never to be full - snap, crackle amen Not only are sales of poetry books up by almost 50% since 2014 (£12.3m in 2018, compared with £8.3m in 2014), Instagram also featured more than 27 million posts using the hashtag #poetry last year. Among those who self-publish on Instagram is Ashanti Wheeler-Artwell, a 25-year-old mixed-raced, working-class spoken word poet. Growing up in Oxford, she started writing poetry at the age of nine, and went to what she describes as a ""very white and very middle class"" school. She said she studied poetry at school and remembers a GCSE anthology called English: Poems From Other Cultures, but recalls her surprise when the photos used in the textbook only featured white writers. ""It was crazy, what were four white faces doing on a multicultural anthology?"" she asks. ""I loved the poets we studied at school, but partly because I had fantastic teachers. Now when I look back, I didn't realise that you can access different types of poets. ""For example, without the internet it would have been years before I discovered Maya Angelou, and other amazing black poets. I wouldn't have known there were spaces to discuss the issues that are important to me, such as class and race etc."" Ashanti, who has struggled to make an income from her poetry, said she wouldn't have considered a career in the industry before the internet - partly due to the fact that she had never seen black women performing poems they had written. But then she discovered them online and says: ""It gave me courage to perform. People don't realise that it is actually very difficult, as a black woman, to get up and talk about race - in a room full of white people."" Unlike Ashanti, Andrew McMillan, 30, grew up in a house where books of contemporary poetry were on his family's bookshelves. But the 30-year-old from South Yorkshire agrees that attitudes towards poetry have changed. Andrew's debut collection, Physical, was the first poetry collection to win the Guardian First Book Award. The award-winning poet and senior lecturer at Manchester Metropolitan University says that, although more young people are buying poetry books, the industry isn't lucrative, as many poets still need part time jobs to fund their passion - unless they are already ""independently wealthy"". Perhaps because of this, he believes poetry will always be niche, but that social media has made poets and poetry more accessible. He explains: ""The form has adapted to different technology, but poems and poetry has become more freely available."" He says the ""very serious, very anxiety-inducing, dangerous times"" also have a part to play as the world enters ""a very difficult decade of geo-politics"" as he describes it. ""Poetry becomes a way to stand back, to bear witness, to contemplate.""","Jay Bernard's teenage poetry was terrible, something the award-winning poet is happy to admit."
"By Tom RolesBBC News India Eva Rae - who starred in the Channel 4 TV series On the Edge - was one of 21 actors to join the Elevate scheme's 2019 intake. She described Elevate as a ""PR exercise"" that failed to open doors for its participants, who she says were recruited to ""clean up"" Bafta's image. Bafta said the vast majority of its participants have a positive experience on the programme. Elevate was established in 2017, shortly after the academy was criticised for releasing all-white nomination lists in the leading actor and actress categories for its annual film awards. The backlash that followed the announcement saw #BaftaSoWhite trending on social media. Rae said that Elevate participants were promised bespoke programmes tailored to their needs, including meetings with casting directors and other influential figures within the industry. But, in one such meeting, she said a casting director referred to her as an ""exotic talent"", adding: ""I can't understand the English coming out your mouth."" Rae said she was then advised to learn English, and to take pronunciation lessons. She said that after the meeting at Bafta HQ, she turned for advice to one of the mentors on the scheme, who advised her not to report the incident. ""This mentor told me and other members of the group that we will never work again if we speak up."" Bafta said it hasn't received any complaints about either incident, but that if it had they would have been taken extremely seriously. Its CEO Amanda Berry told the BBC they were made aware Rae had had a negative experience with a casting director, but denied that the incident had happened at an Elevate event. Bafta's website says Elevate is ""designed to support people from under-represented groups in the screen industries to progress their careers and encourage inclusion across the industries"". ""I'm not really from this world,"" Rae said. ""At the time Channel 4 spotted me I was living in a refuge… I was homeless."" It was while she was filming On the Edge that she was encouraged to apply for the Bafta scheme. Rae said she's worried that if she doesn't speak up, nothing will change. ""I'm very conscious of my privilege of being in these rooms and my duty of care to speak up."" The actress has an auditory processing disorder (APD) that makes understanding spoken information more difficult. Actors with a disability were among the groups specifically encouraged to apply to Elevate by Bafta. Despite, that Rae said she had to ask Bafta repeatedly for support with her needs. ""Why would Bafta create a system where we were set up to fail?"" she added. ""Why did Bafta fail to organise any access co-ordinators, any access audits?"" She is calling for an independent organisation to be allowed to investigate Bafta's procedures. The academy recently announced a new anti-bullying initiative in association with the British Film Institute, and backed by over 40 organisations across film, television and gaming. Bafta's Head of New Talent, Tim Hunter, told Variety that ""one of the key reasons people don't report this behaviour is because they don't have faith in the structures that exist to deal with it"". Rae said when she tried to raise a formal complaint with Hunter regarding the Elevate scheme, he told her that her place on the initiative could be at risk as a result. ""I'm shocked because he's currently out there speaking about systems of bullying in our industry… The only difficulties in access, bullying, and a culture of fear that I've experienced are at Bafta."" Bafta said Rae misunderstood Hunter. It said that if a formal complaint is launched, it might pause participation to ensure a complainant was supported, but that they would consider extending their place on the programme. Bafta CEO Amanda Berry also told the BBC that Elevate asks every participant about their needs on application forms, and in conversations when they start. She said they don't have in-house disability advisers, but that they draw on a wealth of independent experts - and that if an access support worker were needed, Bafta would cover the costs. She said in this case she is confident everything was done to support Rae. ""It is a matter of great sadness and regret for me that anyone would feel this way, and our door remains completely open to find a solution, and to ensure that every participant benefits from the scheme,"" she added. ""I know that other participants have found this to be a truly fantastic opportunity.""",An actress who took part in a Bafta initiative aimed at improving diversity in the film and TV industry has said she was subjected to racist comments while on the scheme and was not given appropriate disability support.
"The season nine opener began with the funeral of Sheen's character, Charlie Harper, after he was apparently killed by a metro train in Paris. The episode also introduced Ashton Kutcher as Sheen's replacement. Sheen was fired from the show in March after criticising its producers and months of reported drug use. The audience for the opener was almost double that of last year's, where 14.65m viewers tuned in. That series attracted between 13m and 15m viewers each week. The sitcom's previous best was 24.24m viewers in May 2005, when it followed the final episode of Everybody Loves Raymond. Details of how Sheen's character would meet his end and how Kutcher's would be introduced had created considerable speculation after producers kept the storyline secret. Viewers saw Sheen's TV funeral attended by his past girlfriends and fiancee, who eventually revealed how he had died. Kutcher appeared as heartbroken internet billionaire Walden Schmidt, who buys Harper's house after making a suicide attempt. Reviews for Kutcher's debut, in which he walked around nude, were kind and suggested that the series was far from dead without Sheen. ""Kutcher's performance was good, nearly as poker-faced fine as Sheen's was... Kutcher will probably prove just as skilled,"" wrote Entertainment Weekly's Ken Tucker. The Los Angeles Times called the premiere ""a promising beginning"", adding that ""Kutcher brings a softness to a series that could be brittle and sour, misanthropic and misogynistic, and temperamentally middle-aged"". Meanwhile, Sheen was also the victim of a TV roast on Comedy Central. The event, which featured the actor being ridiculed by celebrities including William Shatner, Jackass stuntman Steve-0 and boxer Mike Tyson, was watched by 6.4m people. Comedy Central said Sheen's roast was the most-watched, and the second most-watched broadcast in the cable network's history.",Charlie Sheen's TV exit on sitcom Two and a Half Men was watched by 28.7m in the US - the highest ratings for the show since it began in 2003.
"In his entry video, the London Mayoral candidate said he would ""cope with a homosexual in the house"" by ""standing against a brick wall all the time"". The former boxer was booed by the live crowd as he entered the house. Ofcom said it would assess the complaints before deciding whether to investigate. Channel 5 has declined to comment. The former UKIP member is now standing as an English Democrats candidate for London Mayor. In his pre-recorded introduction video, the motivational speaker called himself ""the second coming"". His comments about how he would ""cope"" living with a gay housemate led to loud boos by the crowd. They chanted ""off, off, off"" at him as he was interviewed by host Emma Willis. He ignored the booing and praised them as a ""fantastic crowd"" and said he thought he could win the competition.

"It said its plans represent a ""top-to-bottom change"" and its biggest transformation in decades. Entire departments and news divisions will be moved to Birmingham, Cardiff, Leeds, Glasgow and Salford. The BBC's 22,000 employees, many of whom are currently working from home, were briefed on the plans on Thursday. The plans include: ""Our mission must be to deliver for the whole of the UK and ensure every household gets value from the BBC,"" said director general Tim Davie. ""These plans will get us closer to audiences, create jobs and investment, and develop and nurture new talent."" Other changes to the corporation will include: Mr Davie said the BBC had been ""an essential part of the UK's culture, democracy and creativity for almost a century"" and had faced some of its ""toughest moments"" over the last year. ""Now, as we look to the future, we must play our part in supporting social and economic recovery; rebuilding the creative sector and telling the stories that need to be heard from all corners of the UK."" Plans set out in detail in the BBC's 13-page Across the UK document include: In an address to staff on Thursday morning, Mr Davie said the plans would make the BBC ""a genuinely UK-wide organisation"" and ""a post-Covid success story admired worldwide"". ""People must feel we are closer to them,"" he said. ""This shift will create a much more distributed model that moves not just people, but power and decision-making to the UK's Nations and regions. ""Taken together, our proposals mean the BBC will cumulatively spend at least an extra £700m outside London by 2027/28."" 'Bang for their buck' Broadcasting trade union Bectu said it was ""good to see the BBC wanting to build on its strong local offering and prioritise getting closer to communities"". But its ""immediate concern"" was how the plans would affect is members, adding ""the devil will be in the detail"". It said it would examine the proposals closely to ensure ""workers are properly supported through these changes and that the need for redundancies is minimised"". MP Julian Knight, chairman of the DCMS committee, said it welcomed the BBC's decision to ""rebalance"" and ""give licence fee payers greater bang for their buck"". He expressed caution over the financial implications, however, saying he hoped the BBC would not repeat ""some of the costly mistakes made by the BBC in its previous move to Salford"". 'Radical shift' When Mr Davie was named the BBC's new director general last June, he said the BBC's mission had ""never been more relevant, important or necessary"". ""Looking forward, we will need to accelerate change so that we serve all our audiences in this fast-moving world,"" he said. When he took over the job later in the year, he said there had to be ""a radical shift"" in the BBC's focus to ensure everyone got value from the licence fee.

"By Mark SavageBBC music reporter ""This is sonic cinema,"" said the star, who plays Nala in the film, as she announced the record, called The Gift. Many of her collaborators are familiar - from Jay-Z and Pharrell to her Lion King co-star Childish Gambino. But the album also highlights artists and producers from Africa, who rarely get mainstream exposure in the West. Among them are Nigerian stars Wizkid and Tiwa Savage, South Africa's Moonchild Sanelly and Ghana's Shatta Wale; while the record features lyrics in Swahili, Yoruba and Afrikaans, amongst others. ""I wanted to make sure we found the best talent from Africa, and not just use some of the sounds and did my interpretation of it,"" the star told ABC News ahead of the record's release. ""I wanted it to be authentic to what is beautiful about the music in Africa."" The Gift is a companion piece to the official Lion King soundtrack, featuring songs inspired by the story and its setting, rather than new interpretations of Circle of Life or Hakuna Matata. And the album is unmistakably a Beyoncé hangout: The star appears on all but four of the songs, and her lyrical preoccupations - motherhood, female empowerment, the general awesomeness of Beyoncé - get more prominence than The Lion King itself. Songs directly inspired by the film include the light-footed Find Your Way Back, in which Mufasa passes on fatherly advice to a young Simba; and Otherside, a quietly-turbulent ballad about the King's death, which features a brief callback to Beyonce's megahit Halo. African chants and rhythms are woven into the fabric of the album, lending it a melodic warmth that was missing from the star's last project, Everything Is Love. Like that record, this is a family affair, with Beyoncé's husband Jay-Z referencing Nelson Mandela and Fela Kuti on the braggadocious Mood 4 Eva; and her 7-year-old daughter Blue Ivy getting her first writing credit on Brown Skin Girl. The latter song, with its message of black pride (""your skin is not only dark, it shines and it tells your story"") bears the least thematic relevance to The Lion King, but the compelling vocal and syncopated clicks-and-sticks rhythm make it an undeniable highlight. Of the non-Beyoncé tracks, Tiwa Savage and Mr Eazi's Keys To The Kingdom is a laid-back, if inessential, ode to Simba's potential; while Tekno, Yemi Alade and Mr Eazi's Don't Jealous Me, delivered partly in Nigerian Pidgin English, puts a fun twist on Scar's preening superiority. ""Sheep don't run with lion / Snake don't swing with monkey / I can't talk for too long / Got too much gold to try on."" The final track is The Lion King's Oscar-baiting new ballad, Spirit, which premiered earlier this week with a lavish, spiritual video filmed at Arizona's Havasu Falls. A powerful Beyoncé solo number, it opens with a Swahili chant ""Uishi kwa muda mrefu mfalme"" (long live the king) - but quickly falls back on musical theatre cliché, right down to final chorus's forced key change. It feels out-of-step with the diaspora-hopping richness of the rest of the album; ultimately showing that Beyoncé is at her best when she's innovating.

"By Annabel RackhamEntertainment reporter Hunger Games star Sam Claflin, who stars in its latest film adaptation, thinks this couldn't be further from the truth. His character, Captain Stanhope, heads up an infantry unit in the British army, staving off Post Traumatic Stress Disorder with a large amount of whisky. The display of a man failing to confront his mental health problems was just as much of an issue in 1918 as it is in 2018. ""With Stanhope there's so much more responsibility on his shoulders, he's hit harder and is so much younger than the others who have lived a life,"" Claflin tells the BBC. ""He's in charge of 100 men and that's only the 100 men that are living at that time, not to speak of the men who have died during the three years he's been there."" 'It's OK to be scared or a bit weak' Claflin, whose career has seen him play everything from an aristocrat's son in The Riot Club to a quadriplegic in Me Before You, spent time with four ex-servicemen suffering from PTSD to prepare for his role in the film. ""For me it was a really eye-opening experience and one I hope resonates with a younger audience,"" he says. ""Nowadays I think many men are a lot more open to their emotions and feelings and expressing them, but at that time you wouldn't see a genuine intimacy between men."" The 31-year-old adds that he's excited by how conversations around male mental health are changing. ""It's OK to be afraid and to be anxious or scared or a bit weak - that doesn't make you more or less of a man."" Claflin's interview takes place at a time when the film industry is under immense scrutiny. With his previous roles in the Pirates of the Caribbean and Hunger Games franchises, he has a lot to say about working in Hollywood and specifically the treatment of women. ""There's always the pressure in any industry to be the perfect role model, but it's changing and I think it's good we're having this discussion,"" he says. ""The role of man has changed drastically and thankfully the role of the woman is coming on to an equal playing field."" Claflin says that in his career to date, ""over half of the jobs I've done have been led by a woman, have been directed by a woman, produced and written by a woman."" He also says that, in his experience, the expectations on men and women in the industry are totally different when it comes to body image. ""There was a recent job I did and I needed to lose weight for it, but before the director had even discussed it, I looked at the script and read that he was topless a lot and he was very athletic,"" he says. ""I knew what was expected of me and that's the difference between men and women - it's not necessary that a woman has to [lose weight], especially if she doesn't have to take her clothes off. ""There's ways of discussing subjects like weight loss and from what I understand, a lot of women's experiences are different to how I've ever been spoken to about it."" Claflin hopes that this marks the beginning of a change in the film industry, which sees it become more inclusive. One of his most memorable roles was in Me Before You, the romantic drama adapted from Jojo Moyes' successful novel. His role as a city banker who became paralysed after a motorcycle accident sparked a debate during its release about able-bodied actors playing people with a disability. ""I'm an actor, I'm not really a soldier with PTSD or a pirate, or a footballer but I've played those characters and pretend to be things I'm not,"" is Claflin's response. ""In terms of me being a non-disabled actor playing someone disabled, there are aspects of the film where he is not disabled too."" He says that what should come out of debates like this is more opportunities for disabled actors. ""Often there's a sequel and a prequel as opposed to fresh, new idea,"" he says. ""Someone should come up with a brand new idea rather than shift the ones that are already there. ""I think this is an exciting time for our generation, there are people with brilliant minds who are wanting to have their voices heard so this is a brilliant change.""

"Petty was found unconscious, not breathing and in full cardiac arrest at his Malibu home early on Monday. He was taken to hospital, but could not be revived and died later that evening. Petty was best known as the lead singer of Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers, and his hits included American Girl, Breakdown, Free Fallin', Learning to Fly and Refugee. Obituary: A quiet, unassuming legend ""He died peacefully at 20:40 Pacific time (03:40 GMT Tuesday) surrounded by family, his bandmates and friends,"" said his long-time manager Tony Dimitriades. A statement on the singer's Twitter page described Petty's passing as an ""untimely death"". Petty was also a co-founder of the Traveling Wilburys group in the late 1980s, recording albums with Bob Dylan, Roy Orbison, Jeff Lynne and George Harrison. ""It's shocking, crushing news,"" Dylan told the Los Angeles Times. ""I thought the world of Tom. He was a great performer, full of the light, a friend, and I'll never forget him."" Other tributes include those from fellow musicians Sir Paul McCartney, Carole King, Brian Wilson and Cyndi Lauper. McCartney tweeted that he was ""sending his love"" to Petty and his family, while King said her ""heart goes out"" to ""family, friends and fans of Tom Petty, of which I'm one"". Beach Boys star Brian Wilson tweeted that he was ""heartbroken"" to hear of the news. Canadian singer Bryan Adams thanked Petty ""for all the great rockin' music"". Actor Kiefer Sutherland also paid tribute. He tweeted: ""Today America lost one of its musical giants. Thank you Tom Petty for all the music. To me you will live forever."" Petty also found solo success in 1989 with his album Full Moon Fever, which featured one of his most popular songs, Free Fallin', co-written with Jeff Lynne. In 2002, Petty was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Petty was born in Gainesville, Florida, on 20 October, 1950. He endured a rough childhood, living in poverty with an alcoholic, abusive father - but his life changed in 1961 when he met Elvis Presley and shook his hand. ""That was the end of doing anything other than music with my life,"" he said. He joined two bands at school, The Sundowners and The Epics, before dropping out to play with Mudcrutch, aged 17. After that band broke up, Petty and several of its members formed Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, releasing their debut album in 1976. Their career was slow to take off, but heavy touring - including a well-received support slot with future E Street Band member Nils Lofgren in the UK - eventually pushed them into the chart. Over the next four decades, they became one of rock's most reliable live acts, doggedly sticking to their no-frills rock template, and producing a stream of radio staples including Don't Come Around Here No More and the Stevie Nicks duet Stop Draggin' My Heart Around. Petty scored solo hits with the platinum-selling albums Full Moon Fever and Wildflowers, while the 1991 album Into The Great Wide Open gave the band a number one single, Learning To Fly. The video for the title track was also in constant rotation on MTV, thanks in no small part to cameos by Johnny Depp, Faye Dunaway and a then-unknown Matt LeBlanc. Petty gave his last live shows just a week ago, playing three sold-out dates at the Hollywood Bowl as part of a 40th anniversary tour. Last December, he told Rolling Stone magazine: ""I'd be lying if I didn't say I was thinking this might be the last big one. We're all on the backside of our 60s.

"BBC Trust chairman Lord Patten called the news ""disappointing"", though the head of the World service said there would be ""no cuts to output"". Funding for the World Service will transfer from the Foreign Office to the BBC licence fee from next April. In response to the announcement, Lord Patten said the BBC would increase the service's funding to £245m in 2014. The figure is £6.5m more than the £238.5m currently being provided by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. ""This is the fourth 'one-off' funding cut in four years,"" said Peter Horrocks, director of the World Service. The service, he continued, was ""determined that this unexpected cut should not damage existing services to audiences"" There would be ""no cuts to output nor reductions to staff or headcount as a result"" of the cut, though it did mean the service would ""not be able to invest in new programmes and platforms as planned"". Mr Horrocks welcomed the Trust's confirmation of its 2014 budget, which he said would protect the service. ""International broadcasting is a business that needs long-term strategy and consistent funding support,"" he said. ""When it comes under licence fee funding from April next year, the BBC Trust will be able to give the World Service a far greater degree of financial security,"" said Lord Patten. As a result, he continued, ""it can continue to provide its much-needed and valued services for audiences around the world"". The BBC said it was also expecting the Foreign Office to fund an extra £500,000 this financial year for new TV services in Afghanistan, Burma and Somalia. Speaking last year, Horrocks said 2012 had seen the World Service recover from ""very substantial cuts and drops in audience"".

"By Neil SmithEntertainment reporter Like daredevil adventurer Indiana Jones, the archaeologist portrayed by Ralph Fiennes in his new film wears a hat, digs up relics and sometimes finds himself in life-imperilling situations. That's where the similarities end, however. For one thing, the man Fiennes plays - humble amateur archaeologist Basil Brown - was very much real. So too was the Anglo-Saxon burial ship he helped unearth at Sutton Hoo, one of the most significant historical finds to ever be located on the British Isles. That astonishing discovery forms the basis of The Dig, a historical drama in which history itself comes under the microscope. Based on a 2007 novel by John Preston, it's about uncovering the past at a time when England and the world faced an uncertain future. ""I think it's interesting and maybe lucky the film is coming out when we're in another time of uncertainty because of Covid,"" muses Fiennes. ""I hope people take a positive message from it, about what we can achieve through common endeavour and determination."" Sutton Hoo's extraordinary ship - believed to be the final resting place of King Raedwald, the 7th Century Anglo-Saxon ruler of East Anglia - was revealed in 1939 after landowner Edith Pretty called in Brown to investigate a series of mysterious earth mounds on her estate on the Deben estuary. ""They're not a natural pair and in fact, as you see at the beginning, it's not an immediate connection,"" says actress Carey Mulligan, who plays Edith in Simon Stone's film. ""But there's a mutual respect there - a kinship and a meeting of minds that crosses the social divide."" That kinship is tested in a dramatic scene where Basil is suddenly buried in a collapsing trench. Fiennes - who was born in Ipswich, 10 miles from Sutton Hoo - chuckles when it's suggested that this is his ""Indiana Jones moment"". ""That's the closest I'm going to get!"" he replies. ""But there was no real danger. I was actually more anxious about the scrabbling and the frantic hands close to my face - they were going to give me more injury than the weight of the earth."" Mulligan admits to being ""very relieved"" when the scene was completed, and attributes its success to Stone's quest for authenticity. ""Part of what was fun about working with Simon was he wanted to put us in the real situations as much as he could,"" she explains. Stone, best known for directing Billie Piper in the Young Vic's much-praised theatre adaptation of Federico Garcia Lorca's Yerma, admits he has ""never been hugely interested"" in archaeology and initially thought the Sutton Hoo excavations were ""a dry subject"" for a film. ""But then I read the script and all my presumptions were thrown out of the window,"" he tells BBC News. ""I was suddenly endlessly curious about a subject that hadn't played on my mind much before. ""If you were making an accurate film about archaeology, it would be 99% digging and 0.001% finding treasure,"" he continues. ""It's incredibly laborious, and in some ways for an audience it's like watching paint dry. ""But it's always in the unexpected areas that people can find joy as viewers, and I thought, if I could get the audience to have the experience I had when I read the script, it could be a beautiful surprise for them."" What was found at Sutton Hoo? Edith Pretty died in 1942 aged 59 and was originally to have been played on screen by 53-year-old Nicole Kidman. When his fellow Australian left the project, however, Stone had no qualms about replacing her with 35-year-old Mulligan. ""John Preston's novel departs from the truth in a lot of aspects and doesn't purport to be absolutely accurate, so the scope for departing from historical accuracy was already there,"" the film-maker explains. Mulligan, who admits to having had ""a metal detector period"" about eight years ago, adds: ""I suppose there is an age disparity between me and the real-life character, but then the sense of her I think was the most important thing. ""I was aged-up slightly with make-up to try and split the difference a little bit,"" she continues. ""But it was more important to honour Edith's character and the humble, generous, extraordinary woman she was."" ""History is complicated, isn't it?"" offers Fiennes in conclusion. ""There's a sense of mysterious discovery about who went before us, and I think any aspect of history is a place for reflection or positive interaction about our past and who we are. ""I can't pretend I'm going to be taking up my trowel and go excavating, but I know I'll always have an interest in archaeological stories. When you see the treasures that came out of Sutton Hoo in the British Museum, I can only say it gives me hope."" The Dig is on Netflix from 29 January.

"By Mark SavageMusic reporter The star urged fans not to pay over the odds, telling the BBC: ""I'd rather have empty seats."" Tickets for his 2016 UK tour are being sold for up to five times face value on some sites, even though the shows have yet to sell out. ""I think it's extortionate and I think it's disgraceful,"" he said, joining a growing campaign against ticket resale. Rock band Coldplay recently signed an open letter to the government calling for action over the issue. They said fans were being ""ripped off by touts"" and warned of ""industrial-scale abuse and insider exploitation"" in the ticketing market. Mumford and Sons raised similar concerns, highlighting professional touts that use ""sophisticated"" computer code to harvest tickets from official retailers, before selling them on ""in bulk"". ""It's our hope that secondary ticketing companies root this out to stop it happening on their sites, and that they shut it down,"" said the band, who urged fans to submit their views to a government review on secondary ticketing - after asking for the consultation period to be extended until 18 December. ""We want every seat in a sold out show to be filled with a fan,"" they added, and directed people towards sites like Scarlet Mist, Twickets and Vibe Tickets, which sell tickets at face value. Taking a more proactive step, Adele's management vetted people who pre-registered for her 2016 tour to eliminate potential touts. Working with ticketing website Songkick, they identified 18,000 suspect accounts and managed to keep 36,000 tickets off the secondary market, according to industry estimates. Fans have also been warned they will need to present photo ID matching the name of the customer who originally bought the ticket to get into the shows. It's a similar system to that employed by Glastonbury - which has effectively eradicated touts by introducing a requirement for photo ID. Sir Elton, who has set a top ticket price of £89 for his 2016 tour, urged people not to empty their savings accounts to pay above face value on secondary sites. ""The fact they're willing to pay that [amount] is fantastic. But I'd rather they'd save their money and not come."" 'Huge demand' Ticketing site Stubhub, which is owned by eBay, said: ""We understand the concerns of some artists but the reality is that for many events on our site, the bulk of sellers are fans themselves."" ""The dangers of putting restrictions on music fans and how they buy tickets is that it poses huge risks in pushing them into the back alleys where there are no consumer protections at all,"" said the company's international manager Estanis Martin de Nicolas. Prices for Elton John's UK tour range from £81 to £470 on Stubhub at the time of writing. The company says that more than 10% of tickets on its website this year sold below face value. Viagogo added: ""Sellers set the prices on Viagogo and for popular events such as Elton John's 2016 tour, prices can be higher because there is huge demand and limited supply. ""However, while a seller can list a ticket at any price he likes, it doesn't mean the ticket will actually sell at that price. Tickets for Elton John's UK dates actually start from under face value at £71 on our site.""","Sir Elton John has branded secondary ticket sites ""disgraceful"" for selling tickets to his gigs at inflated prices."

Interviewed by Birmingham's Sunday Mercury, the musician said he had a new lease of life following the surgery. ""Kids, don't start smoking. It's a no-brainer,"" he told the newspaper. ""But I told the docs I wasn't going to give up booze, I wasn't going to give up fags and I wasn't going to give up recreational drugs. ""I love them all and they give me my serotonin, which makes me happy and creative to do my art. I'll do anything that makes me happy. From scoring music to writing stuff, I'll do anything to get my brain motivated."" He added: ""I haven't got a bucket list like so many people who suddenly reach a point and reveal all the things they wished they'd done. ""I've got no regrets. I've lived my life to the full and I'm going to carry on living it to the full - I'm a rock 'n' roller! ""I have never felt more alive, and I am bursting with ambition. I have never had a greater gift than this operation. I am going to make some great art, and I am so excited."" Travers told of how he ""wet the bed"" during his seizure, the first one he had ever experienced, and that ""all I could see was darkness"" when he woke up later. He was taken to hospital and had an MRI scan, where the double tumour in his frontal cortex was discovered. He will now undergo chemotherapy in tablet form and he will have radiotherapy five times a week. In a statement last month, UB40 said they were ""deeply saddened that Brian, our lifelong friend and founding member of UB40, is unable to join us for our celebratory UK tour.

Much Ado About Nothing opened at the Wyndham's theatre in June, receiving positive reviews from the critics. In Josie Rourke's production, Shakespeare's romantic drama is transplanted from 17th Century Sicily to a sun-drenched holiday resort in the 1980s.

"Inception star Tom Hardy, new Spider-Man actor Andrew Garfield, US actress Emma Stone and Kick-Ass star Aaron Johnson are also in the running. ""I'm in very good company with the other actors who have been nominated,"" said Arterton, 24, who appeared in 2008 Bond film Quantum of Solace. The winner will be announced at the Bafta awards on 13 February. Arteton starred opposite Daniel Craig and Dame Judi Dench in Quantum of Solace, the most recent entry in the 007 film series. The Gravesend-born actress also appeared in Clash of the Titans, Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time and Stephen Frears' Tamara Drewe. Film critic and Bafta member Mark Kermode said that Arterton's inclusion summed up what the Rising Star award was about. ""It's not a beginner's list, it's about people on the cusp of stardom,"" he told the BBC. He said that despite starring in big budget movies like Clash of the Titans, Arterton ""came into her own"" in the low-budget kidnap thriller The Disappearance of Alice Creed. ""On the strength of that you could show that to any casting director and say that's the range that she can do,"" Kermode said. Garfield, 27, was recently nominated for a Golden Globe award for best supporting actor for his role in The Social Network, about the Facebook website. He recently landed the lead role of Peter Parker in the next Spider-Man movie, due for release in 2012. Stone will also appear in Spider-Man, playing the part of Gwen Stacy. The 22-year-old's other films include Easy A, Superbad and Zombieland. Kermode said: ""Being in a Spider-Man movie will irrevocably change anyone's life. It's a big project. Peter Parker is one of the great roles. I thank that what's nice is that this nomination has happened now - in advance of that."" Hardy made his name in Spielberg's TV series Band of Brothers and drew plaudits for his lead role in Bronson, in which he played infamous British criminal Charles Bronson. The 33-year-old has been linked to roles in the latest Mad Max and Batman films and will be seen later this year in a new version of Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy. Johnson, 20, played the young John Lennon in Nowhere Boy and was seen last year in comic book movie Kick-Ass. He and Nowhere Boy's director, the artist Sam Taylor-Wood, had a baby daughter last summer. Previous recipients of the Rising Star award, sponsored by telecommunications giant Orange, include Shia LaBeouf and Kristen Stewart. Musician and actor Ben Drew, better known as rapper Plan B, is among this year's judges. Drew said of the nominees: ""They've proved they can act - it's about who can take it to the next level.

"By Annabel RackhamEntertainment reporter But 2017 may be seen as the year that changed all that, thanks to the unexpected stars of shows like Love Island and The Only Way is Essex. Feminism, mental health and positive body image are some of the big talking points that dominated this year's reality shows and got the nation talking. So as we slip on our sparkly dresses and head to ITV's Gala in London, we take with us the question - did reality TV just become more intelligent? The moment when bomb disposal expert Camilla Thurlow turned to business director Jonny Mitchell and asked the question ""Shouldn't we all be feminists? Surely you believe in equality?"" may sound like an excerpt from a particularly heated debated on Woman's Hour, but no, it happened in a villa in Ibiza, televised live on ITV2. Thurlow, who has worked in Cambodia and Zimbabwe, ended a long stint in Afghanistan to take part in the show as a way of overcoming her ""social barriers"". She became an instant hit with viewers because of the way she handled herself on screen, using it as a platform to express her views on the Mediterranean refugee crisis and feminism, after she decided to stop dating Mitchell on the show after he told her he felt emasculated by women who wanted to pay their share on dates. ""I hope I've done justice to what is a very important topic,"" Thurlow tells the BBC. ""Equality, fairness and justice are the things that are most important to me, so I wanted to know I'd respected the feminist movement. I hope I've helped people have that discussion."" Thurlow and her now-boyfriend Jamie Jewitt were the runners up on this year's Love Island. Calvin Klein model Jewitt also used his public profile for good by hosting a TED Talk on social media and how it affects the self esteem of young people. ""You get a good following going on a show like that, it gave me the opportunity to do the things I've always wanted. That wasn't a post-Love Island decision, it's just the way I wanted to do things in the first place. My TED talk came from spending years in the advertising industry,"" he tells us. Fellow star of the show Chris Hughes shares similar sentiments to Jewitt and uses his profile, which includes nearly two million Instagram followers, to talk about male mental health. He carefully orchestrated a stunt online, which saw him pretend that water infused with his tears was going on sale in Topman. It turned out to be part of a campaign for World Mental Health Day, in which he encouraged men to talk about their feelings at a time when male suicide is such a prevalent issue in the UK. ""I suffer from anxiety myself and the stunt was portraying the message that men should not bottle up their emotions and should speak out. ""So many don't speak up and I want to encourage people to get the help they need and bring down the suicide rate in men across the UK, Hughes tells the BBC. Barber Kem Cetinay and dancer Amber Davies were this year's winners of Love Island, which brought in the biggest number of viewers ITV2 has ever had. What was it that made it so successful? The pair think it's because viewers could relate to what the Islanders were going through and became emotionally attached. ""There were heart-aching times for us in the villa and viewers developed a relationship with us,"" Davies says. ""Me and Amber had so many ups and downs and people invested time in us. You want to see something real because everyone can relate,"" Cetinay adds. The prize for winning the show was £50,000, but you'd be naive for thinking its stars are in it for just the love. Like any reality show, there is serious money to be made from advertising, club appearances and clothing collections, which were all on offer to Love Island contestants once they left the villa. This new breed of stars likes to be more picky about what they choose to work on and Cetinay is one of them - he says he wants to have a proper career and has always had aspirations of creating his own haircare brand. ""People automatically assume you [want to make quick money]. I'm so passionate about my work, Amber's the same and I love it. We're always thinking what can we do next,"" he says. This is shared by fellow Love Island finalist, Olivia Attwood, who has created a fashion line for online retailer In the Style and expresses how building a brand is more important than making money for a short period of time. ""I'm being selective and thinking about the long-term plan. I've turned down deals that are tempting because of the money - my focus is staying in the industry long term rather than exhausting everything now."" Someone who knows the importance of using reality TV as a platform for her businesses is The Only Way is Essex's Lauren Pope, who is not only a DJ, but one of the show's most successful entrepreneurs as owner of hair extension brand Hair Rehab London. ""I think being on TV opens you up to a bigger audience you never would have had without it. It just puts you on a platform where people know you exist and someone setting up a business without that backing may struggle,"" she tells us. Being a positive role model to women watching the show is also something she prioritises, along with co-star Chloe Sims, who regularly opens up about the struggle of being a single parent on the show. ""I wouldn't have a salon if it wasn't for TOWIE, but I think the success comes from us being normal people,"" Sims adds. ""As a group of girls we all represent strong women on the show, especially me and Lauren as we don't take crap from anyone and I think that's a good message to give to people.""

"George Bellows' 1912 painting, Men of the Docks, depicts a group of workers standing by the waterfront in Brooklyn. The museum paid £15.6m ($25.5m) for the artwork, which was previously owned by Randolph College in Virginia. It marks a major shift in the gallery's collecting policy, previously limited to paintings by European artists from the Renaissance to around 1900. Bellows, who died at the age of 42 from appendicitis, documented the hardship of working life as New York emerged into the 20th Century. ""I'm a great fan of American painting, but great examples are hard to come by,"" said Dr Nicholas Penny, director of the National Gallery. ""Bellows has almost always been seen in the context of American painting, but the way he painted owed much to Manet, and his depiction of the violence and victims of New York derived from Goya and earlier Spanish art."" The National Gallery currently owns paintings by American-born European artists such as Copley and Whistler, and one minor American work, The Delaware Water Gap by George Inness, which is rarely on display. Realist painter Bellows was the subject of a 2011 exhibition at the National and a retrospective at the Royal Academy last year. Men of the Docks, the final in a series depicting workers gathered on an icy day on the New York waterfront, will hang alongside Impressionists like Monet and Pissarro. Christopher Riopelle, the gallery's curator of post-1800 paintings, called Bellows ""the American master"" whose work evoked ""the raw and unbeautiful energy of the urban experience."" The acquisition marks the start of a Transatlantic academic partnership between Randolph College and the London-based gallery. ""We feel proud that an international audience will now become more aware of Randolph and our long stewardship of Men of the Docks,"" said college president Bradley W Bateman. The Bellows painting was bought principally with money from a fund established by John Paul Getty, established before his death in 2003, and is the first publicly-owned Bellows in the UK.",The National Gallery has made its first ever acquisition of a painting by an American artist.
"Spectre, The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw continued in his five-star review, is ""terrifically exciting, spectacular [and] uproariously entertaining"".

Critics were shown Spectre on Wednesday ahead of its release next week. The film sees Daniel Craig return as British spy James Bond, aka 007, in a globe-trotting blockbuster named after a sinister criminal syndicate. Two-time Oscar winner Christoph Waltz, French actress Lea Seydoux and Italy's Monica Bellucci also appear in the 24th official entry in the long-running series.

Variety also singled out this ""expensively ludicrous opening sequence, set in Mexico City on the Day of the Dead,"" saying it ""ranks among the great 007 intros"". Other industry papers were less effusive, though, with the Hollywood Reporter saying it ""ultimately feels like a lesser film than Skyfall, falling back on cliche and convention."" Screen International, meanwhile, said the film ""falls back on the formula to deliver a slightly flat, old-fashioned 007 by the numbers"".","Critics have given the new James Bond film an enthusiastic welcome, with one saluting it as ""pure action mayhem""."
"More than 20 years after the death of the Grateful Dead founder, the auction of the custom-made guitar fetched a total of $3.2m (£2.5m). It was bought at a New York charity concert by Brian Halligan, CEO of marketing group HubSpot and a lifelong fan of the band - or a ""Deadhead"". The money raised will go to the Southern Poverty Law Centre. Halligan bought Wolf for $1.9m, including the buyer's premium, and had his $1.6m pre-premium bid matched by an anonymous charity. Garcia was the best-known member of the Grateful Dead and was known for his guitar sound. Devoted Deadheads identify five classic guitars which Garcia played at different times: Alligator, Rosebud, Lightning Bolt, Tiger and Wolf. The last two were auctioned together in 2002 and made more than $1.5m (£1.2m). Wolf was put up for auction again on Wednesday night to raise funds for the advocacy group. It got its name after Garcia stuck a cartoon wolf sticker on it as a joke. When the instrument went back to guitar maker Doug Irwin for repairs, he decided to incorporate the motif in a more permanent way.

"By Ian YoungsEntertainment & arts reporter A string of writers are reaching back to the 18th and 19th Centuries to fill in gaps in the story of Britain. In the year that British actress Cynthia Erivo is up for an Oscar for playing US slave-turned-abolitionist Harriet Tubman, many of the new plays are examining the slave era from a British perspective. Find out more about four of the plays and the stories behind them. The African girl adopted by Queen Victoria The experience of a young black woman in royal circles could hardly be more timely. But 170 years before Harry met Meghan, there was Sarah Bonetta, a girl who was taken from slavery in Africa by a Royal Navy captain and presented as a gift to Queen Victoria. ""As a child I'd heard of Queen Victoria having a black godchild,"" says Janice Okoh, whose new play The Gift includes Bonetta's story, alongside a fictional modern-day black woman, also called Sarah. ""The story goes that she was about to be sacrificed by an African king,"" Okoh says of Bonetta. ""We don't know whether that story is 100% true. ""Queen Victoria did not bring her up in her palace, but she fostered her out to people she knew. But Sarah Bonetta had a strong relationship with Queen Victoria's children and mixed in their circles."" Okoh's play comes from Eclipse Theatre's Revolution Mix project, which aims to tell overlooked stories from black British history - especially those from before the Windrush docked from the Caribbean in 1948, which is widely perceived as the start of mass immigration. Okoh says: ""I find it interesting to learn more about my history that is not covered in school. You go away thinking you don't belong anywhere, that black people didn't do anything or contribute to British society, and they did. It's about that."" Linking the past and present in The Gift are the themes of cross-cultural adoption, and how racism rears its head. ""The big question is, how can white people understand what racism is without ever having experienced it?"" the writer asks. ""That really feeds into the debate at the moment with Meghan, and people saying she hasn't experienced racism, she's just disliked. ""She's experiencing that on that level. Can you imagine what black women experience on an everyday level?"" That being said, Okoh stresses that she has channelled the sensitivities and frustrations around race into humour in her play. ""Please say it's a comedy,"" she adds. ""Because it's fun!"" The Gift is at the Belgrade Theatre, Coventry, until Saturday 25 January, then at Theatre Royal Stratford East, London, and on tour. The national slave debt only repaid in 2015 In 1833, the UK parliament passed a law to finally outlaw slavery in the British Empire. The catch? In order to persuade slave owners, the government had to pay £20m in compensation for the loss of their ""property"". That bailout to slave owners amounted to 40% of the country's national budget at the time, or £2.4bn in today's money. The debt wasn't fully paid off until 2015. ""So your salary has gone to paying for this, as has mine as a descendant of the slave trade,"" says playwright Juliet Gilkes Romero, a former BBC journalist. The political manoeuvring behind the 1833 Slavery Abolition Act forms the backbone of Gilkes Romero's new play The Whip, written for the Royal Shakespeare Company. The title has a double meaning - referring to the chief whip who tries to push through abolition, as well as the instrument of torture. The play also features a runaway slave who is the chief whip's parliamentary assistant; another former slave based on Mary Prince, the first woman to petition parliament; and a mill worker who provides a comparison between conditions in the Caribbean and those faced by workers at home. Hours spent researching in the House of Commons library, and a trip with the cast to the Palace of Westminster, gave Gilkes Romero an admiration for the mother of parliaments, she says. ""They knew that slavery was untenable,"" she says. ""It was a moral decision and a pragmatic one. How long could the Empire continue to drive its economic industry and wealth on the back of the enslavement of peoples? It was the right call. ""In America they couldn't agree. They had a civil war. There was carnage. The [British] bill was flawed. It wasn't perfect. But isn't it incredible what was achieved?"" On top of the huge financial outlay, there was great uncertainty about how the British economy would cope. Gilkes Romero sees parallels with the Brexit debate. ""When this country decided to have abolition, they didn't really know what was on the other side of that wall. You're giving up a massive income stream."" The 1830s parliament was debating the fates of freed slaves. While today's decisions about EU citizens and other migrants come at a very different time, she notes similarities in the ""moral choices"" being made. ""What becomes of those people? Will they come here, and what will happen? Will there be bloodshed and violence? Will people forgive and forget? I think there are definitely resonances."" The Whip is at the RSC's Swan Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, from 1 February-21 March. The artist and the slave massacre In 1781, more than 130 slaves died when they were thrown overboard from a British slave ship called the Zong, which had been hit by sickness. Its owners then filed an insurance claim on the value of the loss of their property - the slaves. The artist JMW Turner later depicted the Zong massacre in his 1840 painting The Slave Ship. ""I find it an incredible artistic response,"" writer Winsome Pinnock says. ""In that painting, he says, 'This isn't finished, history doesn't end. And you have to look at it, you have to examine it, before you can move on.'"" Turner, his painting, a black sailor called Thomas and a modern-day actress all somehow feed into Pinnock's new play Rockets and Blue Lights, which switches between Victorian times and the present day. ""The play is about memory. It's about a shared British history,"" she says. ""Contrary to the things people seem to think, there aren't very many plays written on the themes of enslavement by black British writers. There really aren't."" Rockets and Blue Lights is being staged at Manchester's Royal Exchange theatre, a building that itself echoes with history, having once been the largest cotton trading hall in the country. ""The fact that I, a black woman writer, descended from enslaved people - who were denied their voice and their culture - is speaking in that space and have written a play in which I explore that history… That has a lot of resonance,"" she says. Pinnock was the first black woman to have a play staged by the National Theatre in 1995 and has long been regarded as a trailblazer. Her mother arrived in the UK from Jamaica as part of the Windrush generation. When she died several years ago, the writer started thinking about her own connection with slavery, and Britain's role. But she says her show ""plays around with history"" and ""is not looking at enslavement in quite the way that one might expect"". So it's not a straightforward historical re-enactment. ""I often wonder if my ancestors would want me to keep reliving their trauma. And I don't think they would,"" she says. ""I think they would want me to do something else with it. And there are lots of things I can do theatrically to make this relevant."" Rockets and Blue Lights is at the Royal Exchange, Manchester, from 12 March-4 April. The slave who took his master to court, and won In 1778, Joseph Knight successfully challenged his status as a slave in court in Edinburgh - not only defeating his master and winning his freedom, but ensuring that slavery was ruled illegal in Scotland. Knight had been taken from Jamaica to Scotland as the personal servant of sugar plantation owner Sir John Wedderburn. It was, for the period, a more ""nurturing"" relationship than that experienced by most slaves, according to May Sumbwanyambe, who tells the story in the National Theatre of Scotland's play Enough of Him. ""This was a young black man who wanted his freedom but at the same time felt such a degree of loyalty towards his 'master and father' - somebody who had actually been very loving and caring towards him,"" the writer says. ""This was a master and slave owner who genuinely felt anguish and felt betrayed that this young man wanted to be free of him."" Sumbwanyambe was born in Edinburgh but grew up in Grimsby, working night shifts on the docks to earn money during the university holidays while studying for a law degree. He wrote the play against the backdrop of debate about Brexit. ""You kept hearing this thing - 'We want our country back.' ""And it was constantly linked to immigration. The thing that I struggled with is that it was based on this idea that, if only you could just go back 70 years, back to the glory days when Britain still just had an empire but was all completely white. I knew that was a myth."" The point that immigration was happening long before Windrush underpins his play. Sumbwanyambe was surprised to learn that there were thought to have been between 10,000 and 20,000 black people in mid-18th Century London, out of a population of around 700,000. ""Black people have been here and we've been living side-by-side in this country with white people for a very long time,"" the playwright says. ""For all those glory days that people want to go back to - we were there too."" Joseph Knight was among those who left a legacy. ""The journey towards this noble idea of justice and dignity and respect that we think of [as British] was contributed to by that young black man's actions.""

"The co-founder of The Weinstein Company faces sexual harassment claims dating back nearly three decades, which came to light in the New York Times. Clooney, whose big-screen big break was a Weinstein film, said the producer's alleged actions were ""indefensible"". Weinstein, who has been fired by the board of his company, disputes the New York Times report. He has vowed to take legal action against the newspaper, which said in the report that he had reached at least eight settlements with women. Jennifer Lawrence, who won an Oscar for his film Silver Linings Playbook, has also now spoken about the allegations, saying she was ""deeply disturbed"". Clooney, who was given his first big movie role as an actor by Weinstein in 1996's From Dusk Till Dawn and as a director in Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, said he was previously unaware of the allegations. ""The part we're hearing now about eight women being paid off, I didn't hear anything about that and I don't know anyone that did,"" he said in an interview with The Daily Beast. ""That's a whole other level and there's no way you can reconcile that. There's nothing to say except that it's indefensible."" 'Absolutely upsetting' Clooney said he had known Weinstein for 20 years. ""We've had dinners, we've been on location together, we've had arguments. But I can tell you that I've never seen any of this behaviour - ever,"" he said. ""Maybe that's what good will come out of this - that not just in Hollywood, although Hollywood is now the focus, but in all of these cases the victims will feel that they will be listened to, and that they don't need to be afraid."" Lawrence also released a statement, five years on from working with Weinstein on Silver Linings Playbook, for which she won the best actress Oscar. ""I was deeply disturbed to hear the news about Harvey Weinstein's behaviour,"" she told Variety. ""I worked with Harvey five years ago and I did not experience any form of harassment personally, nor did I know about any of these allegations. This kind of abuse is inexcusable and absolutely upsetting."" Actress Jessica Chastain, who has appeared in The Martian and Zero Dark Thirty, also spoke out on Tuesday, saying she had been ""warned"" about working with Weinstein. Unlike others in the industry, who have said they were not aware of his alleged actions, the Oscar winner tweeted her reaction. ""I was warned from the beginning. The stories were everywhere. To deny that is to create an environment for it to happen again."" She also responded on social media to a statement from Kate Winslet, who said the allegations made her ""angry"", and also noted that more men should be speaking up. Actress Emma Watson also tweeted on Tuesday afternoon about women being sexually harassed, but did not elaborate on what she was referring to. Cillian Murphy, whose TV drama Peaky Blinders is distributed by The Weinstein Company in the US, said the alleged behaviour was ""appalling"". ""It's great that it's been exposed and I admire all of these women that have come forward,"" he told BBC 5 live's Afternoon Edition. ""We can't allow behaviour like that to be in our industry or in any industry really. ""When people are honest and speak up, that's all that people need to do. It shouldn't be tolerated in any walk of life so why should it be tolerated in the entertainment industry?"" Over the weekend, Weinstein stepped down from the board of directors at the US charity Robin Hood, which describes itself as ""New York City's largest poverty-fighting organisation"", the charity told BBC News.

"Lucy Lyndhurst said a second post-mortem exam had revealed his death was caused by a condition called Acute Lymphoblastic Lymphoma/Leukaemia. She described Archie as ""the most magical human being we have ever met"". The 19-year-old's death on 22 September had had a ""catastrophic effect"" on their family, she wrote on Instagram. Lucy said she and husband Nicholas were assured by the doctor who explained the post-mortem results to them that there ""wasn't anything anyone could have done as Archie showed no signs of illness"". She said it was ""not leukaemia as we know it"" and that acute in medical terms meant ""rapid"". The couple were ""utterly floored"" to think something like this could happen, she wrote, adding: ""It's very rare and around only 800 people a year die from it."" She said that just days earlier he had been celebrating his birthday with ""the love of his life Nethra"". ""Life is fragile, precious and sometimes incredibly cruel,"" Lucy wrote. She also criticised some media outlets for attempting to garner information about how her son had died from the coroner, before they knew the results of the post mortem themselves. ""To have a coroner call you a few days after your child has died to say the press have been calling for the results of Archie's post mortem, I think stoops to an all time low for us,"" she noted. ""What gives the press the right to badger a coroner's office solely to find the cause of death before the parents? The complete lack of empathy is astounding.

"A viewer had complained over the joke broadcast in June 2012, saying it was ""gratuitous"" and ""offensive"". The Trust did not uphold the complaint and ruled the comic had not been mocking people with a disability. But it said the joke was ""on the margins of acceptability"". In the segment, Noble and Have I Got News For You regular, Paul Merton, were joking about an advert in which the actors were speaking with their mouths full. Using the name by which Merrick was often later called, Noble joked the actors had trained at the John Merrick Academy of Drama and performed the famous line ""I am not an animal"" from the 1980 film The Elephant Man, in a slurred voice. In its ruling, the Trust said the comic had been making reference to the screen portrayal of Merrick by actor John Hurt in the film rather than stereotyping people with disabilities. ""The root of the comedy lay in the commercial and, as such, was editorially justified and had a clear editorial purpose,"" the BBC Trust said. ""The remarks were editorially justified because they referred to the actors in the commercial,"" the Trust added. However the committee agreed some viewers could be offended. ""The impersonation of John Merrick's speech and physical disability, in particular, was at the margins of acceptability,"" they said.","Comedian Ross Noble's impression of ""elephant man"" Joseph Merrick during an episode of Have I Got News For You did not breach editorial guidelines, the BBC Trust ruled."
"By David SillitoMedia correspondent As she left the building, she found herself surrounded by photographers, journalists and film crews. On her cheek was what appeared to be a mark. The court was also shown photographs of what looked like facial bruising. She said Depp had ""violently"" attacked her and in a rage had thrown a mobile phone at her face with ""extreme force"". There were also allegations of other incidents of domestic violence. She said she had endured ""excessive emotional, verbal and physical abuse"" and ""angry, hostile, humiliating and threatening assaults"". Depp denied the abuse. The restraining order was granted, and soon after the marriage was over. Four years later the couple were back in court, but this time in London. However, this was not Amber Heard's case - she had not chosen to be here. This was a libel action Depp had brought against a British newspaper, The Sun. At the heart of the case was his assertion that the allegations of physical abuse were an ""elaborate hoax"". Depp employed one of the best-known libel barristers in the country to try to prove the claims were untrue. Over the next three weeks, Heard arrived at court each day and walked past her former husband's fans, who were convinced that it was their hero who was the victim and it was she who had assaulted him. In court her story, photos, memories and the accounts of her friends were all exposed to the world and said by Depp's team and supporters to be part of a plot to falsely prove that he was, as The Sun had claimed in April 2018, a ""wife beater"". It was not just the fans and media who were watching carefully. Lawyers were already wondering, if he won, what impact this would have on women coming forward with claims of domestic violence. Outside, Johnny Depp would arrive each day to cheers. But his behaviour and lifestyle were also under the microscope - and a judge has now ruled that The Sun's allegations were ""substantially true"". From court to media circus ""Would you like a Johnny Depp face mask?"" A woman holding a cardboard box offered me a small brown envelope. Inside was a black-and-white bandana and personal note of thanks from Johnny Depp. The woman, who was part of the actor's entourage, disappeared into court as all around me fans and onlookers began to inspect their new scarves. This was a strange court case. The rest of Britain was in lockdown, buses and streets in central London were deserted, and yet here, outside the Royal Courts of Justice, there was a crowd, sometimes more than 200 strong. Some wore masks but when Johnny Depp arrived, all attempts at social distancing collapsed in the crush to catch a glimpse. Inside the High Court, it was even more peculiar. The Royal Courts of Justice are huge, gothic and deeply solemn. It's a place of stone arches and hushed tones. And in July it was almost empty. I say almost, because there were a few people - a handful of journalists hurrying through security, and also lingering in the hallways and passages a scattering of Depp fans. One woman showed me her arms, which were covered in tattoos of Johnny Depp. Another man arrived each day dressed as Jack Sparrow, the star's character in Pirates of the Caribbean. And then at around 10:00 each day they would gather at the door to Court 13. As Depp walked past they would offer messages of support and, towards the end of the case, he was seen giving them all a hug. A little chant of ""Johnny, Johnny"" could be heard as he walked into court. Ten minutes later, he was sitting in the witness stand trying to convince a High Court judge he was not a ""wife beater"". The 'wife-beating' accusations The accusations were shocking. Heard said she had been assaulted by him on more than 14 occasions. She said she had, at times, been in fear for her life and left with a broken nose, black eyes and split lip. Vicious, drunken tirades had, she said, lasted for days. There was also a 15th allegation too traumatic and personal to be heard in open court. It felt like a criminal trial; Depp was being accused of repeated assaults on his former partner, the sort of violence that has sent others to prison. But this wasn't a criminal trial. It was easy to forget this was a libel battle between Depp and News Group Newspapers, the publishers of The Sun, because no-one from the newspaper was called to the witness stand. Dan Wootton, the journalist whose article had said there was ""overwhelming evidence"" that the actor was a ""wife beater"" was not even on the list of 79 names cited in the trial's documents. And what a list of names it was. The case began with an email exchange about the perils of addiction between Depp and Sir Elton John and then continued with references to a bewildering cast of characters. James Franco, Marilyn Manson, Elon Musk, Winona Ryder, Kate Moss and Vanessa Paradis were all guest stars in a story that took a private world of the Hollywood A-list and blew it apart. We were shown text messages and video footage of meetings in lifts. The super-rich spend millions protecting their privacy and here was a couple revealing a telephone directory's worth of secrets. No star would do this unless they felt there was something bigger at stake. For Depp, that was restoring his reputation. Why London? But why did this battle begin in the UK? The article with the Dan Wootton byline, in particular the phrase ""wife beater"" in a headline that was later changed, had given Johnny Depp a chance to test his ex-wife's claims in court - and what's more, an English court. It would require a much longer article to explain all the differences, but the essence of the legal split between England and America is that if you write something defamatory in London, the burden is on you to prove it is true. In America, the defamed person has to prove it isn't true, a very different task. It sounds a slender legal nicety but it can make all the difference. England and Wales's libel law was tightened in 2013, but it is still one of the best places in the world for the rich (and it is a rich person's game) to take on the media. If you want to win a libel case and you have a choice about where to bring it, lawyers will suggest buying a ticket to Heathrow. And if you want to understand how big an issue this was for Depp's reputation, look at what he was trading. He lived in a world of security guards and private planes. Going to court blew it apart. If you ever wondered what it was like to be Depp, this case lifted the lid on his privileged but erratic existence, his temper and his history with drink and drugs. Actress, activist and campaigner Amber Heard was 22 when she met Johnny Depp on the set of the film The Rum Diary in 2009. He was 23 years older and in a long-term relationship with singer and actress Vanessa Paradis. Heard's wife at the time was the artist Tasya Van Ree. Two years later, Heard was living with Depp in a penthouse in downtown LA, Depp having separated from Paradis, his partner of 14 years. Heard and Depp married in February 2015, and just over a year later it was over. Since then, Amber Heard has become a vocal campaigner on the issue of domestic and sexual abuse. The UN Human Rights Campaign named her as a Human Rights Champion for her work promoting women's rights. She became an Ambassador for Women's Rights for the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and she has given speeches and written in the Washington Post and New York Times about her experience of domestic violence. In the era of Me Too, she was a leading figure, speaking up for women who had suffered in silence by revealing the abuse she had endured at the hands of one of the most powerful people in Hollywood. She was Amber Heard, actor, model, activist and domestic abuse survivor. When Johnny Depp described her accusations as a hoax, he was not just challenging her story, he was ripping away the foundations of her public profile. There was a lot at stake here. The entire process, which involved an almost brutal public examination of a couple's private life, has been a warning to anyone who wants to use the courts to restore a reputation. It was clearly a deeply troubled relationship, but the case depended on proving who had done what to whom. And in the end, the judge decided it was true to describe Depp as a ""wife beater"".

Anastacia's injury - a tear to a scar from a double mastectomy - had forced the singer to perform a modified routine during her initial dance. The performance aggravated her injury. After hearing she was in the dance-off, she initially said she would dance although she was ""scared"" of hurting herself. She later changed her mind and pulled out. Odoom said after the show: ""I love Anastacia, I think she's a great woman, she's a great role model and her health comes first before everything else. ""As much as this is a great show and competition, her health comes first. It's the way it is."" Anastacia, who had a double mastectomy in 2013 after being diagnosed with breast cancer for the second time, said she was sorry to see Odoom leave Strictly. ""I danced on Saturday even though the doctor had advised me to rest after I ripped the scar tissue around where I had my double mastectomy,"" she said. ""After that, I was unable to dance again and I was devastated that I couldn't take part in the dance-off. ""I am so very sad to see Melvin and Janette go, they are the most the most wonderful pair and I will miss Melvin's unique spirit and beautiful smile.""

"Yazbek is being recognised for her book A Woman In The Crossfire, which is based on diaries she kept during the early stages of the Syrian conflict. It details how her outspoken views against President Assad's government led to persecution, and her decision to flee Syria with her young daughter. Duffy, who is Poet Laureate, was named the winner of the main prize in July. The annual award - in memory of the playwright Harold Pinter - is given to a British writer of outstanding literary merit. The winner then chooses a recipient for the Writer Of Courage Award, which recognises an international writer who has been persecuted for speaking out about their beliefs. Duffy was given a shortlist by the English Pen Writers At Risk Committee, and made her announcement at the British Library on Monday night. Yazbek said: ""I am grateful to English Pen, and to Carol Ann Duffy, for selecting this book, and through it, for supporting our cause."" Lady Antonia Fraser, Harold Pinter's widow, added: ""Carol Ann Duffy's recognition of Samar Yazbek's courage in writing about Syria's revolution from the inside could not come at a more appropriate time"". 'Raw passion' Born in 1970, Yazbek comes from the same Alawite clan as President Bashar al-Assad. Prior to the uprising, she wrote extensively on women's issues in newspapers and journals, while challenging taboos in her novels. Her second novel Salsal (Clay) cast a critical eye over the power of the military, while Cinnamon - which is due to be published in the UK next month - looks at the social divide in Syria through the prism of a servant who enters into a lesbian relationship with her employer. When protests against the Syrian government began last March, she voiced her support online. She received hate mail, her family disowned her and, eventually, she was arrested and shown the cells she would be kept in, if she continued to support the rebels. After further intimidation, she fled to Paris in July 2011 - although she has said: ""I return all the time, but in secrecy. Undercover."" Woman In The Crossfire tells the story of the first few months of the uprising, via her own story and testimony from ordinary Syrians. The Spectator praised the book's ""uncompromising reportage from a doomed capital"", while the Washington Post said it ""brought the cause of the opposition - and its raw human passion for liberation - into focus"".

"By Steven McIntoshEntertainment reporter at Toronto Film Festival The Canadian movie follows the career of Robbie Robertson and the creation of the roots-rock group The Band. At 26 years old, its director Daniel Roher is one of the youngest ever to have been selected to open TIFF. Robertson told reporters on Thursday he had a ""gut feeling"" Roher was the right person to direct, despite his age. ""In so many creative endeavours, you think 'this is taking a shot, taking a risk', but something tells you, 'go forward'... It's quite mysterious in a way, what trust you can have,"" he said. ""And I said to him, by the way, how old are you? And he said 24 [Roher's age when production began], and I was 24 when I made Music From Big Pink with the band, and it just rang a bell, and I thought, let's give it a shot."" Robertson served as both lead guitarist and primary songwriter of The Band, who had a string of hits across the 1960s and 70s. He was born in Toronto, making it a fitting film to open the festival. At Thursday's news conference, Mayor John Tory presented Robertson with a Key to the City, a prestigious award that honours outstanding civic contributions of its Torontonian recipients. How prestigious is opening Toronto? There's no doubt that it's an honour to open TIFF, but the opening film is generally of less significance than the winner of the People's Choice Award, which comes at the end of the festival. While the audience prize winner is a better indicator of success later in the awards season (Green Book went on to win the Oscar for best picture after its triumph at TIFF last year), the opening film can often be a little more obscure. ""In one way, Once Were Brothers is an odd choice to serve as the opening-night film at the 2019 Toronto International Film Festival,"" wrote Steve Pond in The Wrap. in one of the movie's first reviews. ""At a festival chock-full of major awards contenders with big movie stars, it's a documentary about a musician whose music is mostly heard on the occasional oldies station or Americana Spotify channel, by a director with only one previous feature on his resume."" So is Once Were Brothers any good? Well, if you're a fan of The Band and have followed the career of Robbie Robertson, the answer is absolutely yes. But, unless you're particularly keen on beards and black-and-white photos, there's arguably less on offer here for the casual viewer. ""Beyond TIFF, where the opening-night audience members of a certain age will eagerly soak up all those late '60s/early '70s vibes, the market would seem to be less assured,"" suggested Michael Rechtshaffen in The Hollywood Reporter. It was announced at the press conference, however, that the film had already secured an international release thanks to distributor Magnolia Pictures. 'Self-mythologising' Successful music documentaries in recent years include Searching For Sugar Man, the story of how US musician Sixto Rodriguez became extremely famous in South Africa without him knowing, and 20 Feet From Stardom, which told the stories of backing singers in the music industry. But unlike those films, which had more mainstream appeal, Once Were Brothers ideally requires a background knowledge of The Band's work to be fully appreciated. The first reviews of the film have been broadly positive - but many critics have highlighted the self-indulgent nature of the film and a lack of journalistic rigour - a result of the chosen contributors. Writing in IndieWire, Kate Erbland said: ""Without a more well-rounded selection of voices (everyone onscreen agrees Robertson is a genius, a visionary, the undisputed leader of the group even decades on) or a more critical-minded director to give the film perspective, Robertson is free to obscure the bigger questions and deeper meanings, opting for self-mythologising over self-reflection."" Part of this is due to Robertson being one of two surviving members of the five-piece. The other, Garth Hudson, features far less in the documentary than Robertson. ""Director Daniel Roher's job here is to faithfully represent his subject and gather the voices who confirm his recollections - and to put some amazing vintage black-and-white photographs on screen,"" said Variety's Chris Willman. Speaking at the press conference, director Roher praised the executive producers on the film, including veteran directors Martin Scorcese and Ron Howard, for their support in making it. ""What was unique about this project is that it was a very archive heavy documentary,"" said director Roher. ""I have this legendary team surrounding me, and I really only felt empowered. ""Editorially I had a pretty clear sense of what I wanted this film to look like. [Robertson's] memoir reads like a piece of cinema and I wanted to tap into that."" Speaking about opening the festival, he added: ""TIFF is the biggest event in Canadian cinema... I never dreamed this was possible. A Canadian documentary has never opened TIFF before.""

"By Peter Bowes BBC News, Los Angeles When we met in Santa Monica, California, Cher was as Cher-like as you could imagine - a classy three hours late and dressed to the nines. She was upbeat, introspective and as honest as they come. Closer To The Truth is Cher's first studio release since Living Proof in 2002. The first single, Woman's World, a dance track produced and co-written by DJ Paul Oakenfold, is already a club hit. But the singer's return to touring has come as a surprise. It is 11 years since she embarked on The Farewell Tour, a global extravaganza that was later renamed The Never Can Say Goodbye Tour, as it became clear that Cher was in no mood to give it up. The tour was extended several times and ended up completing a record breaking 326 dates. Looking back, the singer says she was convinced that it was a final farewell. ""I really thought it was,"" she says. ""It didn't seem like I had anything else to say."" But, at the age of 67, she has had a change of heart. The new album features two songs written by Pink and is an eclectic mix of dance tracks, ballads and even country. The album's title, which Cher says she likes because it is ""ambiguous,"" comes from one of Pink's songs, Walk Alone. But Cher says: ""If I had thought about it longer, I would have called it, Dressed To Kill, because it seems more appropriate."" The new music has persuaded Cher that she should hit the road again. ""When you have something new to say or new to sing, then it makes the idea of going on tour more reasonable."" But she is not relishing the prospect of travelling. ""I did a tour for three-and-a-half years and it almost killed me,"" she says. ""There's a finite amount of energy that I have. It's pretty boundless, but it's still not endless. ""I know if I don't do it now, I'll never do it. I'm not going to do that many dates to begin with to see if I am still up for this."" Cher's apparent reluctance to leap back into the spotlight, defines a performer who seems to have been more comfortable with her life as it was two decades ago. Today, she says, it is not as much fun. ""It's fine, it's good, I can't complain,"" she says. But she adds: ""I wish I was younger, it was a lot easier."" Cher's career started when she was 17. She found fame in the 1960s as one half of the comedy and singing duo, Sonny and Cher. Married to Sonny Bono for 11 years, the pair enjoyed success with their own TV show and their signature song, I Got You Babe. ""Working with him was probably one of the greatest experiences of my life. ""Being married to him was not that fabulous, but working with him and being with him, we had so much fun. He was such an idiot and he made me laugh all the time. I think we shouldn't have been married, but it was endless fun."" After the couple split in 1975, Cher moved on to a hugely successful solo career, with a string of hits, movies, and sell out shows around the world. ""It was easier years ago for a number of reasons. I had a lot more freedom,"" she says. ""There was no 24-hour news, there were no cell phones. You could come and go as you pleased and now it is much more difficult, because everyone has Instagram and Facebook and Twitter. ""I could ride my motorcycle around and nobody would follow me or take pictures. I could go dancing and dance forever. Now I've just got to be prepared to have sweaty pictures [of me] everywhere. ""Maybe I long for a time where everything wasn't a reality show and you had to do something to become famous. That's the old timer in me,"" she says. But Cher, who regularly tweets with her fans, admits social media has afforded her a new sense of freedom. ""I enjoy it, it is fun,"" she says. ""I'm old enough not to worry about how many people there are or if I say the wrong thing, because many times I say absolutely the wrong thing. But you know, I can just do it and I don't care."" As for growing old, the singer says she does not pay much attention to the passing years and she puts the longevity of her career down to ""luck"". ""I don't know how it feels to be old really. I asked my mom and she is 87 and she's not sure what it fees like either."" As a mother herself, Cher says she is now on good terms with her transgendered son, Chaz. But it was a difficult process for the singer to accept her child's sexuality. ""You wouldn't think it, but I think I knew Chaz was gay way before anybody else, when she was young. I think of Chaz in the past as a she. Chaz is now definitely a he. ""I didn't take it well and I don't know why exactly, there were many reasons, but none of them were valid."" The singer, who has legions of gay fans around the world, says it is ""about time"" that America finally embraced gay marriage. ""Everyone is guaranteed the pursuit of happiness,"" she says. ""In America you are supposed to be able to enjoy certain freedom and it doesn't infringe upon anything. And you can't tell people not to be who they are. If I have learned anything, and the thing with Chaz has made it much more definitive, people have got to be who they are, always."" As she heads out on the road again, Cher is also definitive about the fact that this will be her last tour. ""I won't be doing this forever for sure,"" she says. But the singer insists she will be around for a while - she has ""a million"" things she wants to do, including more acting. ""I have dreams to fulfil that I haven't even dreamt yet - there's no end to ideas, there's no end to things you want to do. ""I like creating and I can't see stopping creating."" Closer To The Truth is released in the UK on 24 September.","Cher, one of the world's most enduring and versatile performers, is returning to the limelight after a decade-long break from recording. The legendary singer, known for her flamboyant outfits and ever-changing hair, is releasing a new album and planning to tour again."
"The British period drama, following the travails of the aristocratic Crawley family and their servants, was also the evening's most-watched programme. Julian Fellowes' drama is a major hit in the US, winning numerous Golden Globes and Emmy Awards. Nielsen figures show ratings were 22% higher than the series three premiere. That episode was watched by 7.9 million people in January 2013, while the third season finale was seen by 8.2 million. That increased to 12.3 million after viewers watched the show on catch-up services over the next seven days. Sunday night's two-hour premiere beat other high-profile dramas, including The Mentalist (9.9 million) and The Good Wife (9.2 million) on CBS and ABC's Revenge (6.7 million). The US scheduling of Downton Abbey has grown increasingly controversial to fans because of ""spoilers"" from the UK, where it is broadcast several months earlier. However, PBS president and CEO Paula Kerger said the start of the new series has become a ""post-holiday tradition"" for millions of US viewers. ""As this captivating drama continues, our audiences have been eagerly awaiting this new season to see what's next for these beloved characters,"" said Kerger. Written by Jullian Fellowes, the drama debuted on British TV screens in 2010 and has since been sold in more than 220 territories. The UK's most recent episode - the Christmas special - was watched by 6.6 million on Christmas Day on ITV, rising to 9.4 million once catch-up services including ITV player were taken into account. It featured Oscar-nominated US actor Paul Giamatti as the ""maverick playboy"" brother of Lady Grantham and son of Martha Levinson - a role reprised by Oscar-winner Shirley MacLaine. Series four achieved an average of 11.8 million viewers in the UK and a fifth season has already been confirmed by Carnival Films and ITV, which is expected to air later this year.","The first episode of Downton Abbey's fourth season was watched by 10.2 million people in the US on Sunday, a record for a series premiere on PBS."

""Even though I'm no longer pregnant, every glance in the mirror reminds me of what could have been,"" she wrote in her latest social media post. Teigen did not clarify in her post why she would not be pregnant again, and did not elaborate on if it was through choice, or whether she could no longer get pregnant or if she had been advised by her doctors not to.

"The star had been suffering from cancer, a statement said. He became one of Britain's best-loved acting stars thanks to roles including Professor Snape in the Harry Potter films and Hans Gruber in Die Hard. Harry Potter author JK Rowling led the tributes, describing him as ""a magnificent actor and a wonderful man"". She wrote on Twitter: ""There are no words to express how shocked and devastated I am to hear of Alan Rickman's death."" She added: ""My thoughts are with [Rickman's wife] Rima and the rest of Alan's family. We have all lost a great talent. They have lost part of their hearts."" Emma Thompson, who appeared with Rickman in productions including Love Actually and was directed by him in The Winter Guest, said he was ""the finest of actors and directors"" and ""the ultimate ally"". She wrote in a statement: ""Alan was my friend and so this is hard to write because I have just kissed him goodbye. ""What I remember most in this moment of painful leave-taking is his humour, intelligence, wisdom and kindness. ""His capacity to fell you with a look or lift you with a word. The intransigence which made him the great artist he was - his ineffable and cynical wit, the clarity with which he saw most things, including me, and the fact that he never spared me the view. I learned a lot from him."" She added: ""He was, above all things, a rare and unique human being and we shall not see his like again."" Announcing his death on Thursday, a family statement said: ""The actor and director Alan Rickman has died from cancer at the age of 69. He was surrounded by family and friends."" Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe said Rickman was ""undoubtedly one of the greatest actors I will ever work with"". He wrote on Google Plus: ""Working with him at such a formative age was incredibly important and I will carry the lessons he taught me for the rest of my life and career. ""Film sets and theatre stages are all far poorer for the loss of this great actor and man."" Sir Michael Gambon, who appeared with Alan Rickman in Harry Potter as well as on stage, told BBC Radio 4 he was ""a great friend"". He added: ""Everybody loved Alan. He was always happy and fun and creative and very, very funny. He had a great voice, he spoke wonderfully well. ""He was intelligent, he wrote plays, he directed a play. So he was a real man of the theatre and the stage and that's how I think of Alan."" Director Ang Lee, who cast Rickman opposite Kate Winslet in 1995's Sense and Sensibility, called him a ""brilliant actor… a soulful actor… [and] a great human being.""

Your kindness and generosity ever since we met in LA in 1987 and ever since is incalculable."" TV star and Bafta ceremony host Stephen Fry wrote: ""What desperately sad news about Alan Rickman. A man of such talent, wicked charm and stunning screen and stage presence. He'll be sorely missed."" Actor David Morrissey also paid tribute. He said: ""So sad to hear the news of Alan Rickman. A wonderful actor and lovely man. Tragic news."" The London-born star began his career in theatre, including with the Royal Shakespeare Company, before winning roles in TV dramas like Smiley's People and The Barchester Chronicles in the 1980s. His performance as the manipulative seducer the Vicomte de Valmont in Les Liaisons Dangereuses on Broadway in 1986 brought him the first of two Tony Award nominations. It also brought him to the attention of Die Hard producer Joel Silver, who offered him his film debut as a result. He went on to become best known for playing screen villains - including the Sheriff of Nottingham in 1991's Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, for which he won a Bafta award, and Judge Turpin opposite Johnny Depp in 2007's Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street. But he showed his gentler side in films like 1990's Truly Madly Deeply, in which he played Juliet Stevenson's ghost lover and which also earned him a Bafta nomination. Further Bafta nominations came for his roles as Colonel Brandon in Sense and Sensibility and the calculating Irish politician Eamon de Valera in 1996's Michael Collins. The following year, he won a Golden Globe for best actor in a miniseries or television film for the title role in Rasputin: Dark Servant of Destiny. Other film credits ranged from Tim Robbins' 1992 political satire Bob Roberts to Richard Curtis's 2003 romantic comedy Love, Actually, 1999's sci-fi spoof Galaxy Quest and the voice of the Blue Caterpillar in Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland. He also moved behind the camera in 1997 directing Thompson and her mother, Phyllida Law, in The Winter Guest. Two years ago, he also directed period saga A Little Chaos, in which he co-starred with Kate Winslet. Meanwhile, he continued to be a major presence on the stage in London and New York. Another Tony nomination came for Private Lives in 2002, in which he appeared opposite Lindsay Duncan on Broadway following a transfer from London. He recently revealed he had married Rima Horton in secret last year.

"Noel Gallagher told journalists at a press conference in July that it was the real reason why the band pulled out of the V Festival in 2009. The official explanation at the time was that Liam Gallagher had laryngitis. In a statement, he said he had ""tried to resolve this amicably but have been left with no choice but legal action"". ""All I want is an apology,"" he added. The brothers have had a long-running public spat since they found fame in the mid-1990s. However Liam, 38, said his brother's comments ""went way beyond rock-and-roll banter and questioned my professionalism"". Noel, 44, made the claims as he promoted his debut solo album Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds. Explaining the demise of the band, he cited the V Festival incident as a contributing factor and further claimed his younger brother demanded free advertising space for his clothing label, Pretty Green, in the band's tour programme. However Liam branded the claims ""lies"". ""I want Oasis fans, and others who were at V, to know the truth,"" he said. ""I was gutted when I couldn't play the gig because I didn't want to let the fans down. The truth is I had laryngitis, which Noel was made fully aware of that morning, diagnosed by a doctor."" He also disputed suggestions of an argument over his clothing line, saying ""there was no such discussion or row"". The band split up soon after. Liam now fronts Beady Eye, made up of former Oasis band members. Representatives for Noel have not commented on the action.",Former Oasis frontman Liam Gallagher is suing his brother Noel over his claims the band once cancelled a gig because the singer was hungover.
"The singer previously refused to allow his autobiography to be published, at one point claiming he couldn't remember writing it in the 1980s. But speaking to BBC 6 Music's Matt Everitt, he explained: ""I really didn't enjoy it... reliving my life, to the detriment of living in the now."" Sir Mick said he gave up as reminiscing ""takes a lot out of you"". ""It takes a lot of reliving emotions, reliving friendships, reliving ups and downs,"" he added. Describing the process as ""dull and upsetting"", Jagger said he gave the money back to the publisher. In a 2017 article for The Spectator, publisher John Blake, who claimed to have a copy of the manuscript, wrote that the ""little masterpiece"" spanned 75,000 words, even in its incomplete form. And despite promising to ""do it another day"", Jagger says that he has not been tempted back to writing, even during the pandemic. Instead, he's coped with lockdown by staying ""pretty creative"" and, perhaps unsurprisingly, focusing on music. ""I've written a lot of songs and finished records,"" he told Everitt. ""Obviously, it's not as good as being together in the same room with a group of musicians. I mean, there's really no substitute for that. But one of the things that kept me going through the lockdown [has been] being able to play music and set up little studios, wherever. ""I was very lucky that I had a couple of places and... a nice garden,"" said the veteran '60s rocker. As a self-professed ""townie"", Jagger said he has ""never spent so much time in the country"" as he has since Covid struck. After 50 years of the touring lifestyle, he admitted that the enforced break has been ""really difficult"" at times. Looking beyond the challenge of getting on with people and ""perhaps spending longer with them than you normally would"", he counts himself as incredibly fortunate. ""You have to be patient, learn self-reliance... but all these things, as I say for me... I'm very lucky. I don't have the problems of living, say in a small flat in London or New York, which some of my friends have had,"" he told the radio host. ""Two kids in a two room flat in Manhattan? I honestly don't know how I would have done that. Maybe a couple of weeks. But for that long, I don't know how I would have done it. And I admire them for being able to do it."" He's also keenly aware of the impact on mental health throughout society. ""I can feel that people could get really quite depressed about the whole thing because there was a point where there was no light at the end of the tunnel. It was sometimes a little bit down for a lot of people, but I was lucky enough to avoid most of that"". Lockdown single to help find light Jagger, now 77 and a father of eight, said he believed his adaptability has helped him ""roll with the punches"" through the uncertainty. And that optimism has extended to his music, including a surprise - remote - lockdown collaboration with Foo Fighters' Dave Grohl. Their track, Eazy Sleazy, attempts to provide a ""sardonic and humorous"" take on coming out of lockdown, at least in the UK, as Jagger reflects on a year of ""crazy"" Covid lifestyle changes, big and small - including the fight against misinformation. ""Shooting the vaccine/Bill Gates is in my bloodstream/It's mind control,"" he sings on a verse which he openly admits is about poking fun at conspiracy theorists. Elsewhere he reflects on a world of ""zoom calls"", ""home in these prison walls"", fake applause and too much TV. With optimism and change in sight he looks forward to normality and the ""garden of earthly delights"". The song was produced by Jagger's long-time musical collaborator Matt Clifford, who also moulded Jagger's two solo 2017 efforts, Gotta Get a Grip and England Lost. Musically, it sees Jagger share guitar duties with Grohl, who also plays the bass and the drums - reprising his role with Nirvana. Jagger told Everitt the pair have crossed paths quite a few times and ""kept in touch"" after meeting during Saturday Night Live shows, performing Stones shows together and impromptu jams. ""I like his style, he's a great musician"", said Jagger, ""rocky... with lots of energy"". This kinship meant that creating the single, even oceans apart, was a ""fun... really easy"" process, partly thanks to Grohl's home studio in Los Angeles. Grohl's commitment was immediate as soon as he heard the song. ""He said 'going in tomorrow. Love it,'"" remembered Jagger. ""So he just did that straightaway."" Despite not being in the same room together, Jagger added Grohl's ""definite personality comes through"" in his drumming style, much like the Stones' stoic, assured Charlie Watts. Touring plans On the topic of his original band, Jagger says he is looking forward to reuniting with his old bandmates, and particularly returning to the stage, even if ""it's a big guess"" when that might happen. Still, he says the Stones will ""definitely"" continue and remain committed to completing their American tour that was postponed by Covid. ""Hopefully things will somewhere near normal by the end of the summer, let's hope, anyway,"" Jagger said. His checklist until then? Typically tireless. ""Improve guitar playing. Practice mouth organ. Do more dancing. Get ready for tour,"" he said, only partially tongue-in-cheek. ""You know, I gotta get in shape because the tour could be sooner than I think. So I've got to be ready for that. And keep the songs coming."" In other words, he just keeps on rolling.

"Speaking to BBC 6 Music, the drummer said the band had written three new songs, which they plan to play on stage this year. He added the songs would be released online and hinted the recordings could be part of ""a long-term plan"" to release a new studio album. ""I hope there's a demand for it,"" the 65-year-old said. The band's last studio album, Say You Will, was released in 2003. Fleetwood said he had written some songs with guitarist Lindsey Buckingham six months ago as ""a calling card"" for singer Stevie Nicks. ""We wanted her to know we wanted to make some new music and we had some great songs,"" he said. ""But her mother died not too long after and it wasn't the time for her to do any singing, so we dropped it."" ""Then recently she's sung on three of them and recorded one original song of hers, so we're going to mix these songs down and there'll be something that we will play hopefully on stage."" Fleetwood Mac announced details of their tour last week. Beginning in April with 34 dates in the US, it will move over to Europe in the summer and the UK in September and October. The band's 1977 album Rumours re-entered the UK album chart on Sunday at number three after a special deluxe edition was released to mark the 35th anniversary of it topping the UK charts.

"By Tim MastersArts and entertainment correspondent, BBC News Bush received a standing ovation as she closed the show with Cloudbusting, from her 1985 hit album The Hounds of Love. The 56-year-old British star was appearing at London's Hammersmith Apollo - the scene of her last live show in 1979. Tuesday's three-hour set kicked off a run of 22 shows, titled Before the Dawn, which sold out in minutes. Afterwards, she thanked fans for their ""warm and positive response"". Backed by seven musicians, Bush opened the show with Lily, from the 1993 album Red Shoes. There was a huge roar from the crowd as Bush appeared on stage - barefoot and dressed in black - leading her five backing singers. ""It's so good to be here - thank you so much,"" she told the cheering crowd. She later introduced one of the backing chorus as her teenage son Bertie who, the star said, had given her the ""courage"" to return to the stage. The first half of the show included the 1985 single Running Up That Hill and, from the same Hounds of Love album, the song suite The Ninth Wave - which combined video, theatre and dance to tell the story of a woman lost at sea. After an interval, the second act was dominated by songs from Bush's 2005 album Aerial. There were no songs from Bush's first four albums, which meant fans did not get to hear early classics such as Wuthering Heights, The Man with the Child in his Eyes or Babooshka. But fans did not seem to mind. Julie Beynon, from Glasgow, told the BBC: ""That was really surprising. I noticed she played a lot from Aerial which I didn't have a problem with. I think it might reference the fact she was much happier in that period of her life. It felt quite joyous and celebratory."" She added: ""I'm not disappointed - I thought it was stunning comeback. To me it was like musical theatre but with Kate Bush songs. It was a a weird hybrid of different styles, and completely innovative."" Elizabeth Hobson, from Enfield, said: ""She does what she wants to do. We might have liked to hear some of the songs we love from a while back - but hopefully everybody's going to be really nice about it and we might see some more of her at a later date."" The audience also largely resisted taking photos or video, as the singer had requested. Bush said on her website last week: ""I very much want to have contact with you as an audience, not with iPhones, iPads or cameras."" 'Butterflies' Fans of the singer showed up early on Tuesday to begin queuing for the show. Richie Cairns from Southampton said: ""I'm almost nervous myself. I've got butterflies. It's something I never thought I'd have an opportunity to see - and it's my birthday. ""I don't mind what she does. I'd have happily sat there for two hours while she played the piano as beautifully as she does. People say we want to hear the hits but I'm not fussed to be honest. I just want to see and hear her after all this time."" Belinda from London turned up looking for a ticket while others had placards begging for a spare. She said: ""I should have been in here in '78 but I was only 12 then, so I'm hoping to see it tonight. I'd pay £150 or £200."" Awarded a CBE for her services to music last year, Bush is one of UK music's most important and distinctive artists. Theories about her long absence from the stage have included her fear of flying and the death of one of the tour crew during a warm-up show for The Tour of Life. In an interview with Mojo magazine in 2011, Bush admitted that tour had been tiring - even for a 20-year-old. ""It was enormously enjoyable. But physically it was absolutely exhausting,"" she said.",Kate Bush has made her stage comeback to an ecstatic response from fans at her first live concert for 35 years.

"Polanski's lawyer has asked the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to give him a fair hearing and ""avoid an expensive lawsuit"". The director pleaded guilty to unlawful sex with a 13-year-old girl - or statutory rape - in 1977 and fled the US before being sentenced. He won the best director Oscar in 2003. Bill Cosby was also kicked out of the Academy earlier this month following his conviction for sexual assault, while Harvey Weinstein was expelled last year as a result of numerous allegations of sexual assault. #MeToo 'mass hysteria' In an interview given before his expulsion, Polanski described the Me Too movement as ""mass hysteria"" and ""total hypocrisy"". His lawyer Harland Braun has written to the Academy to argue that the film-maker's expulsion went against the Academy's own standards of conduct and Californian law. ""The only thing we're asking for is a hearing, a chance to present his side,"" Braun told the Los Angeles Times. ""What I would hope is that [the Academy's legal counsel] would say, 'Let's avoid an expensive lawsuit. Let's just start over. We'll rescind the expulsion and we'll put him on notice that we're thinking of expelling him and we'll give you the opportunity to present your case.' ""That's the only rational thing. Otherwise, we've got to go to court and get a judge to rule that the Academy has to follow its own rules, which should be a no-brainer."" Offence 'wasn't a secret' Mr Braun said he had also sent the Academy a clip of Polanski receiving a standing ovation when he won the best director Oscar for The Pianist - in his absence - in 2003. He said: ""When that award was given, everyone knew about the offence. It wasn't a secret. And all of the sudden, they turn on him and expel him without a hearing? ""I think they thought this was an easy one - an 84-year-old director's not going to fight it, right?"" The Academy hasn't commented. The move comes five months after the organisation approved new standards of conduct in the wake of the Hollywood sexual harassment scandal. It said members must ""behave ethically by upholding the Academy's values of respect for human dignity, inclusion, and a supportive environment that fosters creativity"". Abuses of power It added: ""There is no place in the Academy for people who abuse their status, power or influence in a manner that violates recognised standards of decency."" Any member found to have violated these standards may face suspension or expulsion, it added. Meanwhile, in an interview published by Newsweek Polska, Polanski described the reaction to the sexual harassment scandal as ""the kind of mass hysteria that occurs in society from time to time"". He continued: ""Sometimes it's very dramatic, like the French Revolution or the St Bartholomew's Day Massacre in France, or sometimes it's less bloody, like 1968 in Poland or McCarthyism in the US. ""Everyone is trying to back this movement, mainly out of fear... I think it's total hypocrisy."" Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

"By Emma SaundersEntertainment reporter 1. Frankie Goes To Hollywood Liverpool band Frankie Goes to Hollywood, fronted by Holly Johnson, are still best remembered for their debut single Relax, which was famously banned by the BBC in 1984 due to its sexual lyrics but topped the UK singles chart for five consecutive weeks. The band went on to become only the second act in the history of the UK charts (after Gerry and the Pacemakers) to reach number one with their first three singles when Two Tribes and The Power of Love also hit the top spot. But their glory was short-lived. Their second album, Liverpool, released in 1986, failed to live up to expectations and a backstage bust-up between Johnson and bassist Mark O'Toole at their final gig at Wembley Arena sounded the death knell. While various reincarnations of the band have since reformed, we're still waiting for the original line-up to hit us ""with those laser beams."" 2. The Smiths Never gonna happen. Yes, we know. But just imagine! Johnny Marr and Steven Morrissey formed the band in 1982 with bassist Andy Rourke and drummer Mike Joyce. They went on to release 17 singles and four studio albums, becoming one of the most influential bands of the 1980s. Hits included This Charming Man, Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now, How Soon is Now?, Big Mouth Strikes Again, Panic and Girlfriend in a Coma. But the dream combo of Marr's melodies and Morrissey's musings was broken with the band's acrimonious split in 1987. In Marr's autobiography Set The Boy Free, he revealed that the official version of him walking out on the band wasn't the full story. The tipping point, says Marr, was when Morrissey didn't turn up for the video shoot of the single Shoplifters Of The World Unite, and ordered him to sack their latest manager. Whatever the truth, Marr also wrote that he and Morrissey discussed the possibility of a reunion back in 2008. We're still waiting. 3. Curiosity Killed the Cat Ring a bell? We've been wondering whatever happened to the beautiful beret-wearing Ben with the exotic-sounding surname Volpeliere-Pierrot (although Smash Hits preferred to call him Ben Vol-au-vent Parrot), not to mention Julian, Nick and Migi. The band enjoyed 80s success with soulful pop hits including Down to Earth, Ordinary Day, Name and Number and Misfit. They split after a last hurrah with a cover of Johnny Bristol's Hang On In There Baby in 1992. While Ben has joined some 80s tours singing solo the band have never reunited as a four-piece. It's 30 years this year since Misfit and Ordinary Day entered the charts, so perhaps now would be a good time to hit the road again? 4. Style Council It's well documented that Paul Weller would only reform The Jam if his children were ""destitute"". But what about his later band, Style Council, which he formed with Mick Talbot, formerly of The Merton Parkas and Dexy's Midnight Runners? The Style Council had hits such as Walls Come Tumbling Down!, Shout to the Top, You're the Best Thing and Long, Hot Summer. The band broke up in 1989. Weller has since said they didn't get the credit they deserved. ""I thought we were quite misunderstood and misrepresented. Yet, at the end of the day, we made some good records and I wrote some good songs around that time, songs I still stand by, and I think that will last as well."" 5. The Housemartins Formed in Hull in the 1980s, The Housemartins line-up changed frequently over the years but most of us will remember its most famous members, Paul Heaton and Norman Cook AKA Fatboy Slim. Caravan of Love and Happy Hour were probably their best known hits and Heaton and Cook went on to further success with The Beautiful South and Beats International/Fatboy Slim. In 2009, Mojo magazine got The Housemartins' original members together for a photo-shoot and interview but they said they would not be reforming. So it looks like we won't be hearing from ""the fourth best band in Hull"" - as The Housemartins often described themselves - anytime soon. 6. Bronski Beat/The Communards While Bronski Beat continued following the departure of vocalist Jimmy Somerville in 1985, they are still best remembered for the hits they had with him at the helm, including Why?, Smalltown Boy and It Ain't Necessarily So. Somerville, of course, went on to form The Communards with Richard Coles, who is now a Church of England priest and Radio 4 presenter. But will we see either of these bands back together? Larry Steinbachek, former keyboardist with Bronski Beat, sadly died at the age of 56 in January. And the Communards? Coles and Somerville fell out, not least because Coles lied when he told Somerville he had HIV. The two are back in touch now but with Coles' commitments to the Church, a reunion seems unlikely. 7. The Thompson Twins Yep, it's our wildcard entry - the band that was named after the two bumbling detectives Thomson and Thompson in The Adventures of Tintin. The band had various line-up changes over the years but they were best known as the mid-80s trio consisting of Tom Bailey, Alannah Currie and Joe Leeway. Their hits included Hold Me Now, Doctor! Doctor! and You Take Me Up but Leeway left the band in 1986 and Bailey and Currie could never replicate their earlier success (although they did have a dance hit in 1991 called Come Inside). The pair had two children together and moved to New Zealand. While they did briefly reunite with Leeway on a Channel 4 show in 2001, they have so far resisted the urge to go down the nostalgia road and reform. In 2014, Bailey began performing the band's hits as The Thompson Twins' Tom Bailey and continues to tour in 2017. Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

"The critically-acclaimed first series was based on Margaret Atwood's 1985 novel of the same name about a future dystopia in which women are forced into reproductive slavery to bear the children of the elite. The second series parts company with Atwood's novel but takes off where the last series left off as our protagonist - June/Offred - is bundled off in a van to who knows where. Writing in The Guardian, Sam Wollaston praised Moss's performance in the first episode: ""The hope drains from June's eyes. Elisabeth Moss can say more with her eyes and her face than most actors can with 1000 words. ""It is 10 minutes before she makes her first utterance, but in that time she displays hope, dread, defiance, defeat and strength again. She says very little in the whole episode (mostly in the flashbacks), yet she is mesmerising."" Giving episode one a maximum five stars, he added: ""The opening is about as intense a TV experience as it is possible to have. I felt it physically, a tightness in the stomach."" The Telegraph's reviewer, Jasper Rees, also gave the opener five stars and praised Moss. ""Her face is a mobile canvas onto which she paints bug-eyed fear and pugnacious resolve, even a leering defiance. By the end there was hope after all... it's the role of a lifetime, and Moss is its powerful equal."" The Independent's Jacob Stolworthy described it as ""a harrowing showstopper"" in his headline. He continued: ""The opener is a rollercoaster that ticks all the relentless boxes of the first season, before flinging the series - now off-book - into uncharted world-expanding directions (new characters are set to manifest in the form of Marisa Tomei and Cherry Jones, completing the strongest female ensemble in recent memory)."" But The Artsdesk's Adam Sweeting wrote that the ""casual horrors"" are ""enough to keep you awake at night, though sometimes the show's litany of sadism begins to look dangerously like torture-porn. There's a kind of paradox, too, in the way that a series which has been championed as a feminist call to arms is almost entirely taken up with depicting horrific crimes against women."" Emma Nolan of The Daily Express wrote: ""The season two premiere of Hulu's The Handmaid's Tale was a visceral punch in the gut that wasted no time jumping straight back into the action. ""There are no words for the first several minutes, but they are not needed with Moss conveying such a complex range of emotion with just her eyes and her realisation that this is not a rescue party from Nick, is heartbreaking to watch."" Some viewers tweeted their thoughts, with many enthralled and horrified in equal measure. One wrote that she was both ""addicted"" and ""traumatised"" by the episode. Another was gripped by the opening. Not everyone was impressed though: The Handmaid's Tale is broadcast on Channel 4 on Sundays at 21:00 BST.

Morgan went on to decorate his tweet with two fist-punch emojis. At the time, GMB said it was right to air the controversial interview. Morgan, who co-presents Good Morning Britain with Susanna Reid, also retweeted a comment from Nigel Farage after the complaints list was released. The former UKIP leader said: ""[Morgan]'s doing something right then!"" During a heated debate on the programme on 5 September, Dr Michael Davidson said homosexuality was ""an aberration"", ""a sin"" and ""in some cases reversible"". Morgan told him: ""You know what we call these people [who offer conversion therapy]? We call them horrible little bigots in the modern world. Bigoted people who talk complete claptrap and, in my view, a malevolent and dangerous part of our society."" After viewers said Dr Davidson should not have been given a platform for his views in the first place, ITV responded: ""Should offensive views not be aired even if challenged?"" The episode was one of two programmes to generate more than 1,000 complaints to the broadcasting watchdog. The other was a June edition of Sky News' press preview, during which journalist Melanie Phillips made comments about Muslims that were considered inflammatory.

"Spears, 28, met privately with Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Reva Goetz, who later confirmed in court the arrangement would stay in place. Spears' father Jamie also met with the judge behind closed doors. The conservatorship was imposed in 2008 after the star was admitted to hospital for psychiatric treatment. Judge Goetz said in court that she had ""a very nice conversation"" with Spears during their meeting, but did not give any further details. Lawyers for the singer unsuccessfully attempted to overturn the ruling when it was first imposed in February 2008. In October of that year, the courts agreed that the arrangement, which had been due to expire on 31 December, should continue indefinitely. It was granted by Judge Goetz on the basis that although Spears appeared to be in improved health, she remained ""susceptible to undue influence"". The judge added that the conservatorship was necessary in the light of the pop star's complex financial situation.","Singer Britney Spears' personal and financial affairs are to remain under the legal control of her father, a Los Angeles judge has ruled."
"By Mark SavageBBC Music reporter The 18-year-old enters the album chart at 18, making him the youngest ever cellist to feature in the countdown. His first recording, which includes works by Shostakovich and Leonard Cohen, takes its place alongside the likes of Ed Sheeran and Eminem. The soundtrack to Hugh Jackman's The Greatest Showman stays at number one. The Oscar-nominated recording holds the top spot for the fourth week in a row, denying Craig David the chance to claim his third UK number one album.

"Amol RajanMedia editor There have been some high-profile cases here. Breitbart reported that a mob attacked Germany's oldest church, St Reinold's Church in Dortmund. The website has subsequently published a lengthy defence of its original article, together with an admission that it is not in fact the oldest church in Germany. I visited the church and spoke at length to locals, including a pastor who works in the city (and was named in the Breitbart report), and a local refugee support worker. They were unanimous in the view that the Breitbart report misrepresented true events in service of an anti-Islamist agenda that was divisive and unjust. In Berlin, I spoke to Anas Modamani, a 19-year-old Syrian who enjoys taking selfies. So much so that three weeks after turning up in the German capital, having come from the outskirts of Damascus via a boat trip, Turkey, Greece and Macedonia, he took a selfie with Angela Merkel, who was visiting his hostel. It promptly went viral, together with the false claim that he was a terrorist. He is now suing Facebook. Germany's political class wants to take action. Lars Klingbeil, a fast-rising star of the Social Democratic Party who is a close associate of Martin Schulz, told me his plan to tackle fake news. Perhaps Damian Collins, the Tory chairman of Parliament's culture select committee here, who has launched an inquiry into fake news, could pick up some ideas. Facebook now employs independent fact-checkers here. Correctiv is a smart outfit whose employees are mostly young. Correctiv monitors suspicious stories, looking at how much they are being liked and shared. If the headline looks suspicious, or it appears on a website known to be dubious, the Correctiv team will contact the original sources for the story, to verify if it's true or not. They then mark it true or false, and send a message to all German users of the social media platform, indicating its rectitude or otherwise. They don't accept money from Facebook, because they want to retain total editorial independence. But they too are a sign of how, outside of America, Germany is leading the fight against fake news. Read more: Based on my conversations here, there are several reasons why Germany has got ahead of the curve on this important issue. First, Mrs Merkel's refugee policy is hugely controversial, and has galvanised that part of the political spectrum that, thus far, has shown the greatest propensity for creating fake news internationally: the nationalist far-right. It turns out letting in a huge number of refugees is a good way to mobilise purveyors of fake news. Second, because of Germany's 20th Century history, there is a hyper-sensitivity about the rise of that far-right. The success of Alternative for Germany, a nationalist party, and the ever-present but low-level threat from neo-Nazi groups make many Germans determined to act fast. Third, the traditional media sector here is very different to those of Britain and America. The most influential newspapers are staid rather than raucous; the cable news channels are more BBC or CNN than Fox News, and talk radio has nothing like the oomph that is generated by the likes of Rush Limbaugh or, now on LBC, Nigel Farage. Germany's conventional media market has created an opening for fake news, which of its very nature is salacious and exciting. Fourth, there have been several high-profile cases. The Modamani case is perhaps the most notorious. Groups like the Resistance of German Patriots have been happy to spread nationalist propaganda, with a limited regard for facts. Fifth, my sense is that Germany retains a strong belief in the competence and capability of government. If there is a social problem, goes this thinking, perhaps it is capable of a political solution, by virtue of smart regulation. That was the impression Mr Klingbeil gave, but the belief that fake news should be combated by regulation is not restricted to social democrats: Mrs Merkel's Christian Democrats are also putting pressure on Facebook to make it easier for users to flag suspicious content and delete posts, while those targeted by fake news would be given a right of reply. Sixth, there are local and national elections coming. Fearing a repeat of America's recent experience, where fake stories went viral and may have influenced some voters, Germany believes prevention is better than cure. And Facebook, damaged by the fallout from fake news about Donald Trump, appears to agree. Fake news is not a problem that is going to disappear soon; nor is it one that any journalist can ignore, or be neutral toward. It behoves all of us in this trade - at least those of us who retain a belief that truth is possible and necessary - to wish Germany success in this fight. You can watch my report on the News at Ten on BBC One tonight.","I have been in Dortmund and Berlin this week, investigating how Germany is leading the fightback against fake news."
"ITV confirmed two current morning shows, Good Morning Britain (GMB) and This Morning, would be extended by half an hour to fill the gap.

"By Mark SavageBBC music reporter Like the majority of his 39 chart hits, it featured a guest vocal - in this case from gravel-voiced blues singer Rag 'N' Bone Man. The Scottish producer has previously collaborated with Rihanna, Dua Lipa and Dizzee Rascal, and the music industry is increasingly following his formula. Collaborations accounted for 40% of radio's most-played songs in 2019. That's up from 5% in 2008 and 22% in 2017, according to music royalty body PPL, which monitors the music played on TV and radio; and in pubs and clubs. It said that the four most popular songs on UK radio last year featured two or more artists, including Sam Smith and Normani's duet Dancing With A Stranger and Ed Sheeran and Justin Bieber's summer anthem I Don't Care. The only solo act in the top five was Tom Walker, with the Brit-nominated ballad Just You And I. The trend looks set to continue in 2020: More than half of this week's top 40 singles (52.5%) are credited to multiple artists. So why are musicians teaming up so often? There are several reasons. First of all, the way that artists are credited has changed. When Michael Jackson roped in Eddie Van Halen to play the guitar solo on Beat It, his name didn't appear on the front sleeve or the disc itself. By the time he released Give In To Me in 1991, Slash not only had his photo on the cover, but he received a ""featuring"" credit on the charts. That practice has only accelerated as hip-hop, traditionally the most collaborative branch of music, has become the world's most-listened to genre. Separately, artists have become adept at ""gaming"" playlists on streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music by creating multiple versions of the same song featuring star guests. One of last year's biggest hits, Old Town Road by Little Nas X, had six remixes that helped it span genre-based playlists like country (with Billy Ray Cyrus on guest vocals), K-pop (featuring RM from the boyband BTS) and dance music (in collaboration with Diplo). The side-effect is that collaborations can bring new audiences to an existing song. That's why Doja Cat's smash hit Say So has recently been re-recorded with a guest verse from Nicki Minaj; and Megan Thee Stallion's Savage now comes with added Beyoncé. Staggering the release of these remixes also helps a song sustain its presence on the charts and popular streaming playlists - making more money for the artists concerned. The power of combining two (or more) big names also helped Ed Sheeran become the most-played artist on the UK's airwaves last year. His latest album, the No. 6 Collaborations Project, featured no fewer than 22 other artists, from Eminem and Stormzy to Chris Stapleton and Bruno Mars. He has now topped the UK's airplay chart four times in the last five years - with Coldplay briefly breaking his run in 2016. The PPL noted that eight of the top 10 most-played artists were British, a figure that has remained constant for three years. The charts were revealed as part of its annual report, which announced that the society had collected £271.8 million on behalf of 108,000 performers and rights holders over the last year.

"By Ian YoungsEntertainment & arts reporter At one end of the scale are the self-important, earnest, out-of-touch - and increasingly irrelevant. At the other are the compassionate, creative and life-enhancing. The stars who have actually connected with fans during this crisis are those who have provided positivity, escapism, humour and a human touch. Many have been posting regular videos and even hastily-created home-made shows from lockdown. Here are some of the best: John Krasinski's good news In mid-March, the release of film sequel A Quiet Place Part II was delayed just days before it was due to reach cinemas. Its writer and director John Krasinski didn't sulk. Instead, two weeks later, he launched Some Good News, an uplifting YouTube bulletin that finds positivity shining through the current chaos. The former star of the US Office (and Mr Emily Blunt) styles himself as an alternative news anchor, sitting at a desk in front of a colourful SGN logo drawn by his daughters. He gulps the milk of human kindness by finding stories of heroism and hope from social media, as well as conducting heart-warming interviews with celebrity friends and members of the public. He gave one teenager a virtual prom with the Jonas Brothers and Billie Eilish; brought together the cast of Hamilton to serenade a girl whose theatre trip was cancelled; and recruited Brad Pitt and Robert De Niro as weathermen. His four weekly episodes have had more than 37 million views. Sophie Ellis-Bextor's family discos Of all the home-streamed gigs, Ellis-Bextor's Friday night sing-songs - broadcast live from her sparkly kitchen - are the most joyful. She is carefree and warm, and the charm is multiplied by the presence of her five young children, who play, dance, crawl and squabble around her. The staple tune is her 2001 hit Take Me Home, which she has updated to tell fans to ""stay at home"". Dolly Parton's bedtime stories She's known to millions as the queen of country music, but she now introduces herself to a growing audience of young fans as ""Dolly, the book lady"". She posted the first Goodnight With Dolly video at the start of April, and now regularly films herself reading children's stories in bed. There are few sounds more comforting than Dolly reciting a wholesome, hopeful tale - and occasionally breaking into song. Dolly's storytime is an extension of her Imagination Library, which has distributed more than 130 million books to children in five countries over the past 25 years. Matt Lucas's potato feast The Little Britain star couldn't have predicted the response when he updated his brilliant comedy song about baked potatoes to incorporate coronavirus safety advice. A month later, his Twitter stream's still full of him singing duets of the song with famous friends like Brian May, Rick Astley and Michael Ball, and retweets of people singing it in creative ways at home. It's still never not brilliant. He released the song in aid of his campaign to provide hot meals to NHS workers, which has now raised more than £1.1m. In non-potato activity, Lucas also provides rays of sunshine with daily snippets of cheery and cheesy classic TV as well as his own personal messages. All that may explain why he has been enlisted to host a new Channel 4 lockdown-inspired show called Reasons To Be Cheerful, which starts on Sunday. Richard E Grant's film quotes We already know and love Grant's pure joie de vivre, but he's taken it up a notch since late March by posting daily videos of himself delivering lines from the script of his 1987 film Withnail & I.

"Given the role in July, the actress succeeds Peter Capaldi to become the 13th Doctor. The 35-year-old Broadchurch star said she was ""beyond excited"" to take up the role and the offer had been ""overwhelming, as a feminist"". Whittaker will fully begin her role next year alongside Bradley Walsh, Mandip Gill and Tosin Cole. Capaldi, who has had the role since 2013, regenerated at the end of the episode to become Whittaker's character. When she was appointed, Whittaker told fans not to be ""scared"" by her gender.

The drama is due to be broadcast in 2014 and has been written by Bafta winner Adrian Hodges. Hodges said he was ""thrilled"" the actors have committed to his ""modern and original take on this great story"". The Musketeers will be played by Great Expectations actor Tom Burke as Athos, Santiago Cabrera from Merlin as Aramis, and Howard Charles, who has acted with the Royal Shakespeare Company, as Porthos.

"By Neil SmithArts reporter, BBC News Dame Shirley Bassey was amongst the performers at the event, held at the Royal Albert Hall in central London. The musician, best known for his work on Born Free and the James Bond films, died in January aged 77. Ex-James Bond Timothy Dalton and Beatles producer Sir George Martin were among the speakers. The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra performed selections from a host of Barry scores. Broadcaster Sir Michael Parkinson opened the tribute, remembering the composer as ""a great man of music"". Barry, he said, had ""an intuitive understanding of how to create the perfect union of music and the moving image"". Those sentiments were echoed by Sir Michael Caine, who appeared via video message to salute ""one of the all-time greats"". ""John was one of my oldest and closest friends,"" the actor continued, reliving the night he had stayed with the erstwhile bandleader only to be kept awake by him working on one of his most famous compositions. ""I was the first person in the world to hear Goldfinger,"" the veteran star recalled. ""And I heard it all night."" Lyricist Don Black remembered Barry as a proud Yorkshire man who remained so, despite living in the US for much of his life. ""I like to say John put the York in New York,"" said Black, whose collaborations with the multiple Oscar-winner included the title song from 1966's Born Free. Zulu, Midnight Cowboy, Dances with Wolves and Out of Africa were among other films to have their soundtracks showcased in the extensive programme. The concert also featured excerpts from some less familiar Barry scores, among them music from 1965 comedy The Knack… And How To Get It. Elsewhere Welsh tenor Wynne Evans - standing in for the indisposed Alfie Boe - gave a powerful rendition of 'Ave Maria. Inevitably, though, it was Barry's contributions to the Bond series that took precedence at an event attended by several members of the so-called ""007 family"". These included Bond producer Michael G Wilson, Goldfinger's Shirley Eaton and actress Samantha Bond, who played Miss Moneypenny from 1995 to 2002. David Arnold, who wrote the music for the last five Bond films, produced the programme with Barry's widow Laurie and also performed. Dalton - whose first outing as Bond, 1987's The Living Daylights, was graced by Barry's last contribution to the series - said the composer had been ""generous, warm and funny."" The actor went on to recite a poem by John O'Donohue, the Irish writer and philosopher who inspired Barry's final album, Eternal Echoes. ""John would love to know you were here for him,"" said Sir George Martin, declaring that his friend had had ""an unerring instinct for what a film needed"". His tribute followed a 'Bond Suite' featuring music from Thunderball, From Russia with Love, You Only Live Twice and others that brought the audience to its feet. London-born singer Rumer got a similarly warm reception, despite fluffing a line during her performance of 'We Have All the Time in the World' from On Her Majesty's Secret Service. The song - originally performed by Louis Armstrong and later used in a Guinness advert - had been a personal favourite of Barry's. The most sustained applause was saved for Dame Shirley as she took to the stage near the end of the evening to belt out the theme tunes to Diamonds are Forever and Goldfinger. All profits from the concert will benefit the newly established John Barry Scholarship for Film Compositio, at the Royal College of Music, London.",Friends and fans of the late film composer John Barry have celebrated his life and career at a memorial charity concert.
"By Mark SavageBBC Music reporter In the UK, that means events like Reading and Leeds, Wireless, Latitude and Download will go plastic free. It's part of a push to achieve zero waste at Live Nation's clubs, concert halls and venues by 2030. The pledge comes after independent British festivals like Glastonbury and Bestival vowed to cut plastic waste. Glastonbury has announced it will not sell single-use plastic water bottles this year, owing to concerns about their impact on the environment. While Bestival, Boardmasters and Kendal Calling were among 61 festivals who signed up to the ""drastic on plastic"" initiative last year, pledging to rid their sites of single-use plastic by 2021. They have also called on retailers such as Argos and Tesco to stop marketing and selling tents as single-use items, saying abandoned tents account for 875 tonnes of plastic waste every summer. Awareness of the impact of plastic on the environment has grown exponentially over the last few years. It's thought that more than eight million tonnes of plastic enters the world's oceans each year, harming wildlife and entering the food chain. This week, the government announced new restrictions on the sale of plastic straws, plastic drinks stirrers and plastic cotton buds, which will come into effect in England from April 2020. Live Nation's commitment will affect about 20 UK festivals and more than 20 venues, which it manages through the Academy Music Group. These include high-profile concert halls such as the Brixton Academy, King Tut's Wah-Wah Hut in Glasgow, the Manchester Apollo and Cardiff International Arena. Examples of single-use plastic items at concerts include: Live Nation says it will start trialling plant-based water bottles across Europe in 2019. It has also launched a new set of sustainability goals, including a target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions 50% by 2030; and a commitment to send zero waste to landfill by 2030.

"By Vincent DowdArts reporter, BBC News The story focuses on the 1965 marches from the town of Selma in Alabama to the state capital Montgomery, protesting at the effective disenfranchisement of African Americans in the Deep South at that time. The film shows how crucial Dr King was to those marches and to the passing of the 1965 Voting Rights Act - legislation which President Johnson had thought could wait. The film's credits list Mr Webb as sole screenwriter but the director Ava DuVernay has been openly critical of the script she inherited and has said she rewrote the film extensively. Speaking out for the first time, Mr Webb has given the BBC his side of the story. When did you start to think about writing the story which ultimately became Selma? I wrote a draft of the film Lincoln for Steven Spielberg. The consultant was the American historian Doris Kearns Goodwin and I and my wife got to know her and her husband Dick. Many years before, Dick Goodwin had worked for President Johnson's administration and is famous for having written LBJ's famous speech on voting rights in 1965. Dick wrote it overnight when LBJ made a snap decision to call a joint session of Congress. He said he needed it to convince Congress the country needed the bill enacted very soon. And then Dick told me a story about Alabama's right-wing Governor George Wallace coming to lobby the president and how Johnson was a real force of nature with him. So I decided here was the story I wanted to tell. I started reading about the era and about Johnson. But I soon realised that the man who had made it necessary to pass the legislation so urgently was Martin Luther King. The story which needed telling was the Selma voting rights campaign, in which he was central. I read everything I could get my hands on about Martin Luther King but I knew I wanted to avoid making him a conventional, almost sublime heroic figure. Because Johnson was real and visceral and in a drama he would have wiped the floor with a character like that. King was flawed and he was complex and magnificent. Finally the thing which really captivated me about Dr King was the sheer moral and physical courage of the man. That man knew every time he got out of a car that someone could kill him. So it was always a film about the two men? As I started to get into it, King took over. He took centre stage and dominated with Johnson now pushed more to one side. Dr King has about 650 lines in my original script and Johnson has just over 400. That gives you some idea: it's Dr King's story. Johnson did say after the triumph of his speech to Congress that people will say Martin Luther King wrote that speech on the streets of Selma. And in my script he adds 'And they'd be right'. LBJ had the political nous and the realism to grasp that. Did anyone query if you as a Brit should be writing about such a hugely important slice of American history? Not at the time - but maybe it's become an issue now. When I started working on this with my producer Christian Colson, we were both relatively naive. But our naivety produced a script which Michael Mann wanted to be on board - and at different times Stephen Frears and Paul Haggis and Spike Lee. Every one of them hoped their reputation and enthusiasm would generate enough belief from the financiers but one by one they had to drop away. It went on for years. Eventually Ava DuVernay became attached as director. She has been blunt in the States in saying she rewrote much of the screenplay. How do you react to that? Those claims are highly exaggerated. Ava is someone I spent some time with and I like and admire her: she's a very talented woman. She has told the story very well though it's not quite the story she was given. There has been a controversy in the States regarding the depiction of President Johnson so I'll restrict my comments to that issue alone, as it's an issue we can be relatively objective about. Is the LBJ we see in the finished movie very different from the one you originally wrote about? Very. I feel Ava reduced Johnson in her depiction to a racist. And dramatically he's a bit of a punch-bag. The relationship that occurred between those two men was much, much more dynamic than that. The problem is with turning Johnson into someone who was against voting rights and against the Selma campaign. Certainly Johnson found the Selma campaign very difficult to handle - it made life uncomfortable for him and he wanted to deal with voting rights the following year (1966). He had a lot of social reforms on his desk which he wanted to get moving first and which were less contentious. Now Dr King wasn't in a position to oblige him: he was obligated to his own constituency. So these guys who'd been partners the year before on the 1964 Civil Rights act, which ended segregation, then came into conflict over Selma. But that is not to say Johnson was against the very idea of civil rights. He was passionate about voting rights. If you look at the movie now there is scene where Johnson is conspiring with J Edgar Hoover (Director of the FBI). As we all know, and as Johnson knew only too well, Hoover is a monster. What LBJ was trying to do in my script - and in reality - was put the leash on Hoover. Johnson was quite happy to keep tabs on people - he was a control freak who wanted to know what everybody was going to do next. But he wanted Hoover to use his power and organisation to protect Martin Luther King. By reducing Johnson that way in the film, you diminish Dr King at the same time and I think that's a great pity. Ava DuVernay has said she didn't want to make a film where white people are the the guardian angels of black Americans. She wanted a film where black people take hold of their own fate. Can you sympathise with that? No, because that isn't what happened. I know Ava has said she didn't want a white saviour movie but it never was a white saviour movie. It was about the courage and genius and leadership of Martin Luther King driving the most powerful man in the world into a corner. And Johnson just had to say, okay you win. It was Johnson's finest moment and King had driven him to that height. The movie kind of throws that away now. Despite all the tensions, do you remain proud of Selma as a film? Yes because the idea, the story, the structure and the principal characters remain fundamentally mine. And the film is out there: it's finally been made. I'm very happy about that.","For years British screenwriter Paul Webb had tried to persuade Hollywood that a film about Dr Martin Luther King, President Lyndon B Johnson (LBJ) and the fight for black rights in 1960s America would be a hit. This weekend his film Selma is one of eight movies nominated at the Oscars in the best picture category."

"By Neil SmithEntertainment reporter, BBC News Yet even he must regret the rash comments that have seen him declared a ""persona non grata"" by the organisers of the Cannes Film Festival in France. It was apparently clear to those present at Wednesday's press conference that he was joking when he declared himself a Nazi who felt sympathy for Adolf Hitler. It was also clear, though, that his misguided attempts at humour had taken him into areas where there is little humour to be found. Born in 1956 in Copenhagen, Lars Trier began making movies as a child with a Super 8 camera. He went on to study at the Danish Film School, where he was encouraged by his fellow students to adopt the ""Von"". Award-winning student films were followed by his first feature, The Element of Crime, in 1984. A nightmarish, visually distinctive thriller, it became the first of several Von Trier works to be shortlisted for Cannes' prestigious Palme d'Or award. The director was back in Cannes in 1991 with Europa, a drama set in Germany in the aftermath of World War II, which ended up sharing the Jury prize. Von Trier was put out not to win the Palme, though, referring to Roman Polanski - chair of that year's jury - as ""the midget"". The Dane's international standing was boosted by The Kingdom, an atmospheric mini-series set in a creepy Copenhagen hospital. He also received acclaim for Breaking the Waves, an unsettling film about a naive young woman - played by Britain's Emily Watson - whose devotion to her husband has shocking consequences. To most cineastes, though, he is best known as a co-signatory of the Dogme 95 manifesto - a ""vow of chastity"" he made with three fellow Danish film-makers. Their films, they declared, would strip away artifice by being shot on location using natural light and handheld cameras. Under these self-imposed restrictions, Von Trier made The Idiots - a hugely divisive film about young people who pretend to be mentally and physically impaired. The BBC's Mark Kermode was so incensed by the result he was ejected from its screening in Cannes after loudly voicing his objections. Deathbed confession In 2000 Von Trier finally won the Palme d'Or with Dancer in the Dark, a musical starring Icelandic pop star Bjork as a woman who ends up on Death Row. The film was attacked by some for being anti-American - charges that also dogged his next projects, Dogville and Manderlay. The former, the first part of a proposed ""US trilogy"", saw a starry cast - led by Nicole Kidman - enact a period parable on a vast, largely empty soundstage. The latter was embroiled in controversy from the off after the actor John C Reilly walked off the set in protest at the director's plans to have a donkey killed. By now, Von Trier was firmly established as an ""enfant terrible"" who enjoyed an often combative relationship with members of the press. That reputation was only enhanced by his 2009 film Antichrist, which whipped up a furore at Cannes with its explicit sex scenes and graphic violence. The director stared down his critics, declaring he had made the movie for himself and that he was ""the best film director in the world"". ""I don't think I owe anyone an explanation,"" he said of the movie. ""I made it for myself."" Von Trier has spoken openly about his unconventional upbringing, which saw him raised by Jewish parents who were both committed communists and enthusiastic nudists. He has also battled depression - a possible consequence of being told by his mother, on her deathbed, that his biological father was, in fact, her German employer. Throughout his career, the organisers of the Cannes Film Festival have remained staunch supporters. It remains to be seen, however, whether he will ever be welcomed back to an event that may finally have tired of his idiosyncracies.","The Danish film-maker Lars Von Trier has never shied away from controversial material, or from making contentious pronouncements."

"The 2015 Great British Bake Off winner allowed cameras to follow her as she sought a diagnosis and treatment. She was seen having therapy, speaking about how her anxiety and panic attacks stemmed from childhood bullying and serious health problems in her family. It was an ""incredibly open, honest and moving account"", one viewer wrote. In Nadiya: Anxiety and Me, which was shown on Wednesday, she spoke about her regular panic attacks and voices in her head telling her she's not good enough. Anxiety was ""often an overwhelming feeling I can't control"" and ""a monster"" that stops her functioning, she said. ""Having anxiety is probably one of the most lonely, most isolating things to have because you are your own worst enemy and you live inside your head,"" she said. During her cognitive behavioural therapy, she traced her problems back to when her brother and sisters both had life-threatening illnesses as young children, and the severe bullying she suffered at primary school. Racist bullies would pull her hair out, slam her fingers in doors until all her fingernails fell out, and flush her head down the toilet. ""I still have that memory of the water going up my nose and feeling like if they don't pull me up now I am going to drown with my head in this toilet,"" she said. After that, she hid under a sink and had her first panic attack. ""If I could erase my memory, then I would take that one memory out of my head, because that memory is always there,"" she said. The Daily Telegraph's TV critic Isabel Mohan wrote: ""By opening up about the severity of her condition and tackling it head-on, Hussein should now become an inspiration to her fellow anxiety sufferers."" The programme also followed Hussain speaking to other sufferers, and doing something that would have been unthinkable before - taking an unplanned train trip to London. Mohan wrote: ""It feels bizarre that this familiar, friendly face, regarded as Bake Off's biggest success story and a huge role model for many British Muslims, would ever be so scared of a simple trip, and is an important reminder that we shouldn't assume that our friends and family are doing OK just because they're all smiles when we see them."" Writing in The Huffington Post, Rachel Moss said: ""In a world where nearly nine in 10 people with mental health problems say stigma and discrimination have a negative effect on their lives, honesty like Nadiya's feels like something we all need.""

"By Mark SavageEntertainment reporter After seven years away from the studio, Janet Jackson releases a new album, Unbreakable, on Friday. It comes after a tumultuous decade in which her brother, Michael, died; and her music was banned by some US radio stations after a Super Bowl ""wardrobe malfunction"". Unbreakable feels like a response to those events, as well as some happier ones, in particular Jackson's 2012 marriage to Qatari businessman Wissam Al Mana. Over 17 tracks, the singer talks about grief and depression, but also about love, loyalty and compassion. Most importantly, she stresses, friends will pull you through the hard times. The record reunites Jackson with producers Jam and Lewis, who rescued her from bargain bin ignominy in 1986, and masterminded all of her most successful albums, from Control to janet and beyond. Speaking to the BBC from New Orleans, Jimmy Jam revealed the stories behind the star's signature songs, and picked his highlights from the new album. WHAT HAVE YOU DONE FOR ME LATELY (from Control, 1986) Janet's first single with Jam & Lewis, What Have You Done For Me Lately presents the singer as a fierce, independent woman, ruthlessly dismissing her feckless boyfriend. ""You ought to be thankful for the little things,"" she scolds, ""but little things are all you seem to give."" Originally, What Have You Done For Me Lately was going to be a track on an album Terry and I were working on - our own album. The rest of the Control album was totally done but [record label executive] John McClain said: ""Hey guys, I just need one more song."" The lyric came up because of a relationship Janet had gotten out of [her marriage to soul singer James DeBarge, which was annulled a year earlier]. The concept was basically, ""he used to do nice things for you, but what has he done for you lately?"" All of the songs we did with Janet on the Control record had a lot of attitude. She always had a lot of attitude in the parts she played on TV and we thought that was missing in her previous albums. So, with Nasty, with Control, with a lot of the songs on the album, we tried to bring that out: Really aggressive tracks, really hard-hitting tracks, because we knew she could pull them off. STATE OF THE WORLD (from Rhythm Nation 1814, 1989) The Rhythm Nation album opens with a triptych of songs calling for action against poverty, racism and illiteracy. Among them is State of the World, which captures Janet's growing horror as she witnesses homelessness, drug dependency and prostitution right on her doorstep. We were trying to do something like Marvin Gaye's What's Going On - although we never could hope to achieve that - but we wanted to make people aware of what was going on, in a way where you could dance to it. On that record there were a lot of metallic sounds, a lot of trash cans and glass breaking - the sort of things that were the sonic landscape of the streets. Did we worry about front-loading the album with a big social message? No, we weren't concerned. Maybe if the record company actually heard what we were doing, they wouldn't have liked it. But the nice thing about Control and Rhythm Nation was they were done in a vacuum. We were in Minneapolis, away from the record company scenes of LA and New York. There wasn't really any outside influence. But I have always thought, what if you gave that same batch of songs to the record company and said, ""OK, here's our album?"" Would that album be called Escapade? And would the album have a nice colour photo of Janet smiling on the cover? THAT'S THE WAY LOVE GOES (from janet, 1993) Beckoning towards the bedroom, Janet turned down the lights and turned up the heat on this slinky, seductive song, based around a sample from James Brown's Papa Don't Take No Mess. An unexpected change of style - lyrically and musically - it was the public's introduction to a more adult Janet. I'm a huge James Brown fan and I always thought it'd be cool to take something funky he did but actually make a song out of it. So that was the intention. Everybody seemed to really like it but when I played it for Janet, she kind of said, ""eh, it's OK."" And so we moved on - because we were working on a ton of other things, too. When we took a break around the Christmas holidays she said, ""put a cassette together for me"" and I put that track on there because, in my mind, it was still a viable track. She went to Anguilla and when she came back, the first thing she said was ""we've gotta work on that track"" and she immediately came up with the title. Janet had recently signed a record-breaking $40m contract with Virgin Records, who wanted a different song - If - to be the campaign's first single. The star was inclined to agree, until a rap megastar intervened. If was basically like the tail-end of Rhythm Nation. It was very loud, metallic. They were all in love with it. In their minds, that was the first single but we [Jam & Lewis] were going: ""No! That's what everyone expects!"" We had Chuck D and [hip-hop producer] Hank Shocklee in the studio and we said: ""Can we get your opinion?"" It was about three in the morning, but we played That's The Way Love Goes, and then we played If and said: ""So, which one?"" Chuck was like, ""If, man, that's a Janet record. But that other one... That's like when Sade releases a record, and there's no hype about it, it's just all-of-a-sudden in front of you."" And so Janet looked at him, and she said: ""OK, it's That's The Way Love Goes."" Obviously it worked out really well but there are still people who think it would have been better to go with If first. GOT TIL IT'S GONE (from The Velvet Rope, 1997) A departure from Janet's commercial sound, this gritty, pared-down groove surprised many fans - not least because it sampled Joni Mitchell's Big Yellow Taxi. First of all, we had to call Joni Mitchell and get her permission. But she was a fan and said, ""I can't wait to hear what you guys do,"" which was really cool. It's a very sparse track. I'm a huge fan of [late hip-hop producer] J Dilla and that record was my attempt to do a J Dilla track. I thought it sounded like bohemian hip-hop. It was interesting in this country because pop radio didn't touch it. Probably the video didn't help. Mark Romanek did such a beautiful job but it was so ethnic... It just wasn't what people were feeling. SHOULDA KNOWN BETTER (from Unbreakable, 2015) 25 years after State of the World, Janet realises how little has changed. ""Why, why, why?"" she cries over a pounding house beat, before making a renewed call for social action. ""We won't make excuses. We won't take no abuses."" When you're young, you feel like: ""I can change the world! I'm going to lead the revolution!"" And then you look 25 years later and you go: ""OK, I should have known better. The same problems still exist but there's a different way to go about tackling it. It still involves mobilising people, but I can't do it by myself."" It's just a wiser, more mature look at the reality of trying to make a positive change, a social change. LESSONS LEARNED (from Unbreakable, 2015) Over a plucked guitar figure, Janet sings about an abusive relationship where the victim keeps circling back for more. ""What makes her want to stay?"" sighs the star. I actually did this track in an airport on my laptop. I don't know what I was feeling, but I played it for Janet and she just went away and came back with the lyrics. That's probably Terry's favourite song right now and has been for a while. He really fell in love with the lyrical concept. It's about abusive relationships - but not pointing blame. Just the kind of revolving door they become. You allow it to happen, and it takes two people for that to happen. It's a very resigned song. GON' B ALRIGHT (from Unbreakable, 2015) Riffing on Sly & The Family Stone's Dance To The Music, Gon' B Alright closes Janet's new album with a cartoonish, effervescent bounce. ""We all need a little love when we get down in the dumps,"" Janet giggles as the brass section bustles. At the beginning of talking about the new album, one of the things we wanted was to have something with a Sly and the Family Stone energy [and] a Jackson Five feel to it. She's always stayed away from anything like her brothers' [music] but we really felt like that this was appropriate. Particularly on a song like Broken Hearts Heal - which is a song directly about her brother, and them growing up together. Gon' B Alright squeaked onto the album at the last minute. We really had a tough time recording it - maybe two or three attempts. Interestingly enough, Janet actually does all the vocals - all the high voices and the low ones - with a little tape trickery and Janet singing in different voices and different characters. We thought it was a great way to end the album - on a note of optimism. I think the record is everything she wanted it to be. So I hope people are accepting of it and enjoy it. Unbreakable is out now on Rhythm Nation / BMG.","Janet Jackson's chief collaborator, Jimmy Jam, reveals the secrets behind their biggest hits and talks about her new album, Unbreakable."
"The $100m (£77m) film, which was expected to make double that amount, debuted fourth on the US chart, with the new Stars Wars movie on top. In the UK and Ireland, it grossed £3.4m, having been panned by critics. According to the Hollywood Reporter, an updated print of Cats was sent out to cinemas on Friday. The trade paper reported that the film's director, Tom Hooper, had ordered re-edits to his film with ""some improved visual effects"". It is highly unusual for a finished title already on release to be altered in this way. The movie has an all-star cast that includes Taylor Swift, Idris Elba, Rebel Wilson and Jason Derulo and is based on the hit stage musical by Andrew Lloyd Webber. With Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker at number one at the US box office, Cats trailed after Jumanji: The Next Level and Frozen 2. Hooper, who made Oscar-winning film The King's Speech, has been open about the fact that he only just managed to finish his CGI-heavy movie before its world premiere in New York. At the event, Hooper told Variety it was completed in a 36-hour sprint on the Sunday. Cats started on a bad footing even before release, with critics almost unanimously branding it a flop, even though social media reaction after the premiere had been more flattering. The Daily Telegraph's Tim Robey called it a ""sinister, all-time disaster from which no one emerges unscathed"", giving the film no stars. ""Everything feels off, from the scale of the purpose-built set (which makes the cats look more like Borrowers) to the erratic interpretations of its musical numbers... Regarding cats or humans, Hooper, it seems, has nothing to say,"" said Simran Hans in the Guardian in her one-star review. BBC News Arts Editor Will Gompertz said wrote that while he didn't think Cats was ""terrible"", he felt Tom Hooper had ""missed the spot"". ""The harsh truth is the film feels plastic, it has no heart or soul. That might well be a problem with the source material and its suitability for a transfer from stage to screen. Notwithstanding notable successes, the fact is not everything that is a hit in one medium works in another,"" he continued, giving the film two stars. But the movie could still make up some ground after the main Christmas festivities are over and people head out to be entertained.

"By Vincent DowdArts reporter, BBC News For decades, its staff have delighted in the suggestion Orwell took his notion of absolute hell from two years spent at the BBC. Near the end of Nineteen Eighty-Four, Winston Smith finds himself trapped in the Ministry of Love's Room 101, ""many metres underground"". He must face the worst thing in the world (which turns out to be a rat). Since the book came out in 1949, some have suggested it was Orwell's comment on a similarly-numbered room at Broadcasting House, where he had to tolerate endless dull meetings. War work The idea appeals to writers trying to make sense of what seems an unlikely part of Orwell's career - his time on the BBC staff from August 1941 to November 1943. But Orwell didn't even work at Broadcasting House. When, aged 38, he became a talks assistant in the Overseas Empire Department and was based in premises, the BBC had moved into 55 Portland Place. After a year, he became a talks producer at the Overseas Eastern Service, working in a basement the wartime BBC had acquired from the gents clothing department at the store Peter Robinson. (Today he would be on Oxford Street, smack in the middle of Urban Outfitters or possibly Schuh.) Orwell was already a well-known journalist and novelist. But he wasn't world-famous, as he later became with Animal Farm (in 1945) and with Nineteen Eighty-Four. His biographer DJ Taylor believes Orwell was genuinely keen to join the corporation. ""His health was already shot to pieces and it became clear he would never be called up to fight in the war. I think he saw the BBC as a form of war work."" Propaganda without lies Initially a lot of Orwell's time was spent writing a weekly news commentary aimed primarily at India, to be read on air by Indian members of the department. The typescripts were rediscovered and published in the 1980s. They're summaries of how the war was going and there was no pretence of being great literature. His news commentary 75 years ago this week, for instance, focused on events around El Alamein: ""The Battle of Egypt has developed into a great victory for the United Nations. The Axis forces are not yet destroyed, but they are in great danger..."" Taylor thinks Orwell was an energetic propagandist. ""It may seem strange because now we think of Orwell as the most truthful of writers. But he knew the war needed winning and that good propaganda would be a part of that. When later he grew disillusioned, which clearly he did, it was because he feared the propaganda simply wasn't effective. ""He had no problem with the concept of propaganda for a cause which was morally right, so long as you didn't tell lies. But there is an irony that he was a propagandist for a regime at war with another regime - and in that surely we see the roots of Nineteen Eighty-Four."" After about a year, those in charge seem to have decided that because Orwell was a known supporter of Indian independence it would go down well in India if his name became more associated with the broadcasts. Orwell's presence on air made the propaganda seem less like propaganda. He invited the likes of TS Eliot and EM Forster to broadcast to Asia and was permitted to go on air himself - although in January 1943 BBC mandarin JB Clark wrote a tart memo highly critical of Orwell's ""unattractive"" voice. A long line of documentary-makers have been aghast to find that somehow none of the programmes in which Orwell took part ever made it to the BBC archive. Simon Rooks, who runs that archive, says it's a disappointment but no surprise. ""In Orwell's time very few things were recorded: radio was essentially a live medium. But in the war the BBC started to broadcast far more to other parts of the world. ""And if you're broadcasting to India, which Orwell often was, some parts of the output have to be transmitted in the middle of the night. There would have been recordings to facilitate that. 'Cabbage-patch hair' ""But those functional recordings were on acetate discs: they only had a thin lacquer coating and could play a handful of times before wearing out. Recordings were sometimes transferred to more robust archive discs for permanent use. But very few overseas programmes were ever kept - and sadly nothing with George Orwell."" Orwell died in 1950, aged 46, so the voice is one reference point which hasn't been available to Martin Jennings, who was commissioned to make the new sculpture. His John Betjeman and Philip Larkin were both much praised. ""I've been an admirer of Orwell for years so I suppose it's my knowledge of the writings which is the basis of the piece. I was delighted to be approached by Ben Whitaker who was behind the whole idea."" (Whitaker, a human rights lawyer and former Labour MP, died in 2014.) ""The BBC is donating a wonderful home, though the funding has all been from private donors. But when I knew where it was going, that had implications. It's standing against a particularly tall Portland stone wall and will be elevated on a plinth. ""But it seemed to me that Orwell was the last person to be on a plinth. So I have made him stoop rather to the viewer - so perhaps it's more that he's on a soapbox, engaging an audience."" The location where Orwell is placed has been an unofficial smokers' corner ever since Broadcasting House was extended in 2013. So it's appropriate that Jennings' Orwell has a roll-up in one hand. He's also given the tall, gangling, slightly cadaverous writer ill-fitting clothes and cabbage-patch hair which he thinks were characteristic. ""But the placing also seemed to demand words on the wall behind Orwell: it would have seemed incomplete otherwise. In the end Ben Whitaker came up with the right choice."" The quotation is from a proposed preface to Animal Farm, which was never used: ""If liberty means anything at all, it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear."" Jennings says they're ""an interesting and quite a challenging selection of words for a public service broadcaster"". He says: ""It's both Orwell talking to the political journalists of the BBC, and it's the BBC expressing what it stands for to the general public.""

"By Mark SavageBBC music reporter Songs from the record, which is dedicated to his late mother, were streamed 25.5 million times last week, said the Official Charts Company. A progressive marriage of drill, trap, UK rap, dancehall and US hip-hop, it confronts the turbulent realities of growing up in Britain's inner cities. It tops the chart just six months after the rapper was released from prison. The 26-year-old, whose real name is Irving Adjei, had been jailed in for carrying a knife, and later described the experience as a ""wake-up call"". ""Those kind of situations was my normality years ago,"" he told The Guardian, referring to three previous jail terms from his youth. ""It was a wake-up call that it really is a thin line - one wrong move and it's all over, it's back to what you used to dream to get out of."" By the time he was jailed in January, the rapper was already one of the biggest names in UK rap, with a string of increasingly-impressive mixtapes and a guest slot on Stormzy's second album, Heavy Is The Head. An eighth mixtape, Gang, hit streaming services within hours of his release, and entered the charts at number five. It marked a move away from the rapper's origins in drill - a darker, bleaker variant of grime - towards a more melodic, less insular sound. That comes to full fruition on Edna, notably on the chart-busting single Ain't It Different, whose catchy hooks hide a message about the dull reality of prison life (""You ain't ever made a birthday cake from digestive biscuits,"" he raps at one point). Elsewhere, he resolves to ""right my wrongs"", promising to make ""a different way of livin'"" despite the mockery of his former associates. Reviewers said the album ""highlights his impressive lyrical capabilities"" and delivered ""as authentic a vision of life on the margins as you could wish for"". ""Edna is proof that he's the unmistakeable, global 'King of drill', and much more besides,"" concluded the NME. ""It's a move into the mainstream, without forgetting where it all began."" ""Having my debut album go to number one means a lot to me,"" said the star, who posed with his Official Chart Award at his mother's graveside. ""Edna,"" he added, ""this is for you."" The album tops the charts after a close three-way battle with fellow UK rappers D-Block Europe and the late John Lennon. Lennon's Gimme Some Truth, a new compilation produced by his widow Yoko Ono and son Sean Lennon to mark what would have been his 80th birthday, enters the chart at number three. D-Block Europe's debut, The Blue Print - Us vs Them, is at number two. In the singles chart, 24kGoldn's Mood ft Iann Dior holds tight at number one - and Fleetwood Mac's Dreams re-enters the Top 40 for the first time in 43 years, The song, which has seen a surge in popularity after soundtracking a viral video on TikTok, rose 18 places to Number 37 this week. Written and sung by Stevie Nicks, it only made number 24 upon its original release in August 1977.

"The Reckoning, which will be shown on BBC One, will tell the story of the presenter's rise, and the sexual abuse scandal that emerged after his death. Executive producer Jeff Pope said it was ""a story that has to be told"". He said: ""We must understand why a man like Jimmy Savile seemed to remain immune for so long to proper scrutiny and criminal investigation."" It is not yet known who will be cast in the lead role. Savile was one of the UK's top entertainers in the 1970s and 80s, known for TV shows like Top of the Pops and Jim'll Fix It, as well as stints on BBC Radio 1. After his death in 2011, an ITV documentary investigated claims of sexual abuse against him, leading to further allegations of abuse and a string of public inquiries. These found that the broadcaster had leveraged his involvement in organisations such charities, hospitals, prisons and the BBC to prey on hundreds of people - mostly vulnerable young females. 'Sensitivity and respect' BBC drama controller Piers Wenger said the new drama did ""not intend to sensationalise these crimes"" but ""to give voice to his victims"". He said: ""We will work with survivors to ensure their stories are told with sensitivity and respect and to examine the institutions which Jimmy Savile was associated with and the circumstances in which these crimes took place. ""Drama has the ability to tackle sensitive real life subjects and consider the impact of a crime on its survivors and what lessons can be learnt to stop this ever happening again."" In 2016, an independent investigation found that the BBC missed opportunities to stop ""monstrous"" abuse by the presenter and DJ because of a ""culture of fear"". The Dame Janet Smith review identified 72 victims of Savile in connection with his work at the BBC, including eight who were raped. Eleven of his victims were younger than 12 years old. The BBC was also criticised for dropping a Newsnight investigation into the sexual abuse claims - which was then picked up by ITV. The BBC's former director general George Entwistle later admitted to MPs this had been the wrong decision. The Reckoning will be written by Neil McKay, who was also behind Appropriate Adult - the Bafta-winning drama about serial killer Fred West.

"Will GompertzArts editor@WillGompertzBBCon Twitter It happened to me a few years ago on one rainy afternoon when I'd ducked into a gallery to avoid a downpour. The place was showing a nine-channel video, which sounds as dreary as these things usually are, but, I reasoned, was probably marginally less awful than getting soaked. Anyway, the shower looked as though it was passing, I reckoned I could leg it after a couple of minutes. I set my expectations a notch or two below those of a tailor at a nudist camp, and entered the room in which the 52-minute multi-screen epic was being shown. One hour later, the sun now shining, I was still standing in the middle of the gallery, surrounded by the nine huge video screens, growing increasingly impatient as I waited for the film to start all over again. What I had just seen was wonderful: a romantic work of art with the spirit of a Brontë novel; made by the Icelandic artist Ragnar Kjartansson and eight of his arty mates from Reykjavik. They were each stationed in a separate room of a down-at-heel mansion as they sang in sync a lament (""Once again I fall into my feminine ways"") written by Ragnar's ex-wife, the poet Ásdis Sif Gunnarsdóttir. If the work is ever installed near you, check it out (you can watch it on YouTube but it's not the same). The piece is called The Visitors, a homage to Abba's last studio album by an artist who credits the band as an influence. He's not the only one. The fictional pop duo Lars Erickssong (Will Ferrell) and Sigrit Ericksdottir (Rachel McAdams) are also fans, as you quickly find out in Netflix's spoof rom-com, Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga. Lars and Sigrit go back a long way. We first meet them as young children in 1974, with Lars sitting despondently on the stairs of his home, mourning the recent death of his mother. His father (Pierce Brosnan) is drowning his sorrows in front of the TV while watching the Eurovision Song Contest with a room-full of friends. Abba come on and start singing Waterloo. Lars perks up no end and starts dancing in front of the telly, transfixed by the Swedish fab four. He declares right there and then that one day he will win the contest for Iceland. Nobody is impressed or cares very much, other than Sigrit. Spool forward three decades to the small Icelandic town where Lars and Sigrit still live. By day he is a parking attendant, she, a primary school teacher. By night they are Fire Saga, one of the worst bands ever to set foot on a stage - and there have been some very bad bands stepping up over the years. The locals barely tolerate Lars and his immature dream of Eurovision fame, while being baffled by the much-smarter Sigrit's loyalty to him. They grudgingly allow Fire Saga to perform in the local pub but only as long as they stick to a strict one-song set-list consisting of Yah, Yah, Yah Ding Dong. This upsets Lars, who is keen to try out his latest material on them. Suffice it to say that with a little help from the local elves, his childhood dream begins to come true and Fire Saga find themselves on a plane heading for the Eurovision Song Contest in Edinburgh (suggesting Britain won the year before, which, even in this Will Ferrell co-created fictional world, is stretching credibility somewhat). You can see why the film got made. It has some tasty-looking ingredients such as Ferrell's track-record with spoof-comedies such as Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy. Then there's the global popularity of the Eurovision Song Contest and its loyal audience of many millions who have missed out on their annual kitsch-fest fix due to the pandemic. Add to that the Mamma Mia! phenomenon: a tongue-in-cheek, Abba-themed comedy that so knowingly, and cleverly meta-mocked itself into being a multi-million-dollar box office smash hit. It trod a fine line and didn't misplace a step. Unlike, Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga, which is misjudged and tedious. That thing about instinctively knowing a great work when you see one applies to the opposite end of the spectrum. You don't need to be a cinephile to know this film is dud. Mamma Mia! made you smile, The Story of Fire Saga makes you groan. The script is more predictable than a Swiss watch, accents slip in and out like the signal on a pirate radio station, and Ferrell's Lars is not nearly loveable enough to save the picture. Lazy clichés and tired stereotypes abound, from the camp show-runner to American tourists only interested in finding the nearest Starbucks. Worse, the depiction of Icelanders and their culture as an unsophisticated bunch of beer-drinking, whale-watching, knitted jumper-wearing innocents is tiresome and ignorant. Ragnar Kjartansson is not a one-off, an outlier who somehow managed to forge a career as an artist and therefore escape an inevitable life as a fisherman. Iceland has a vibrant artistic community, which has produced some brilliant writers, musicians, and fine artists. They didn't come from nowhere, they emerged from a rich seam of intellectuals that make the country such a magnet for artists of all kinds the world over. To be fair, the movie isn't all bad. Pierce Brosnan doesn't sing, Rachel McAdams is really good as Sigrit, and some of the production around the performances at the fictionalised Eurovision Song Contest are as slick and spectacular as the real thing. But, none of that masks what is ultimately a thin, lame film that had permission to be kitsch but not corny. It is a good idea badly executed; being neither funny nor clever. Deux points. Recent reviews by Will Gompertz Follow Will Gompertz on Twitter","You don't have to know loads about art to recognise a great piece when you see one.

"Amol RajanMedia editor@amolrajanon Twitter At their lowest point, all five were down more than 20 per cent from their peaks. This translates to hundreds of billions of dollars in value being wiped from them. Apple was the first company to cross the $1trn mark this year. It fell to $840bn by close of play on Tuesday, and hasn't recovered since. Amazon, which also briefly crossed over the $1trn threshold, dropped to $731bn. That's a quarter of a trillion dollars right there. I know your sympathy for Jeff Bezos may be limited, but these are big numbers. Facebook, meanwhile, is trading at around the value it had early last year - long before the scandals of this year took their toll. But those scandals may be a distraction from the big pictures. Why are tech stocks taking a hammering, and what does it indicate about the wider macroeconomic picture? When considering market fluctuations and, by extension, whether to invest, the key is to look at the fundamentals and over the long-term. Some context here is vital. Global worries These companies are still exceptionally rich, staffed by many of the smartest innovators on earth, and good at planning. Moreover, they are registering whopping profits; indeed, record-breaking profits in Amazon's case, and forecast-beating profits for Apple and Facebook. And given the wider hit to stock markets from weaker global GDP growth, and with a looming potential trade war between America and China, it's inevitable that tech stocks should also be hit. But a new world is emerging for these companies, in which three fundamental shifts point to a new era that will place limitations on their acceleration. That is not to say they will go into reverse; just that they might slow. First, monetary policy is tightening around the world. Since the financial crash, we have lived in an extraordinary period of sustained low-interest rates. This has been good for borrowers. When borrowing is cheap, investors are - relatively speaking - more relaxed about returns. When the cost of borrowing rises, so do investor demands for reliable returns. The shift from quantitative easing to quantitative tightening puts a discipline into the market. Rising interest rates make equities sweat. Tech stocks are feeling the effect. The second big change, which is well documented, is the threat of national and supranational regulation. A feeling unites legislators from Washington to Brussels, Berlin and Delhi: smarter regulation of these companies is socially necessary and, probably, economically manageable. Resurgent nationalism in many parts of the world has curtailed the freedom of many global companies, which tech giants almost by definition are. And the example of GDPR in Europe, which aims to shift control of data back to consumers from these companies, is being closely watched. If it is seen to work, it will be widely copied. Peaking out The third big change is perhaps less documented, and most alarming for these companies. This is the possibility that they are maxing out on scale. Reid Hoffman, the co-founder of LinkedIn, has co-authored an important new book called Blitzscaling. This riffs on the idea that it is the remorseless pursuit of scale that gives data-based companies their advantage. The first scaler, rather than the first mover, will emerge victorious in various markets. That, according to Hoffman, is why venture capitalists are happy to tolerate the lack of profits at a company like Uber. If this argument is right, what if companies like Facebook and Apple have already squeezed most of their advantage from blitzscaling their particular markets? Apple's growth has long been powered by the iPhone - but its popularity with each new version is slowing, as rivals launch brilliant counter-attacks, and markets become saturated. In the key markets of US, Canada and Europe, Facebook hasn't grown at all in the past quarter. Think about what that does to the mentality of a company used to super-star growth, on its way to 2.6bn global users. What if, say, 3bn users is where Facebook will peak? That is why, by the way, the company is trying to make Instagram, which it owns and which is still growing fast, sweat, by putting more ads in that arena. What if a back-lash against the misuse of data means consumers spend more time in the private arena of WhatsApp, where there are fewer ads, and it's much harder for Facebook (which also owns WhatsApp) to sell me a car in WhatsApp than on the Facebook News Feed? Never had it so good Of course it is true that the relentless drip, drip, drip of scandals engulfing some of these companies, especially Facebook, will weigh on investors too. But go back to the bigger picture. For well over a decade, during which workers of the world dealt with a financial crash and just avoided a depression, these technology companies enjoyed astonishing freedom. They were able - largely through their own ingenuity - to pursue growth remorselessly in a low-interest rate world, where they endured relatively little regulation. New markets and vistas constantly opened up to them, and their tax affairs were tolerated in a world of globalist sentiment.

"The author discovered he had cancer last year, and wrote about the experience in his last book, Quicksand: What It Means To Be A Human Being. His best-selling novels, which follow policeman Kurt Wallander through Sweden and Mozambique, were turned into a TV drama starring Sir Kenneth Branagh. Sir Kenneth paid tribute, calling the author ""a fine writer and a fine man"". He was the third actor to play the irascible detective. In Mankell's home country, both Rolf Lassgard and Krister Henriksson played the role. BBC Four screened the latter version in the UK. In a statement, Sir Kenneth said: ""In life and in art Henning Mankell was a man of passionate commitment. I will miss his provocative intelligence and his great personal generosity. Aside from his stringent political activism, and his decades of work in Africa, he also leaves an immense contribution to Scandinavian literature. ""His loving family, and those privileged to know him, together with readers from all over the world, will mourn a fine writer and a fine man."" Born in February 1948, Mankell wrote dozens of plays, novels, children's books and screenplays. But it was for his Wallander series that he was most renowned. The rumpled and gloomy detective got his name when Mankell ran his finger through a telephone directory, but went on to sell more than 40 million books. 'More popular' Mankell's life and career were shaped by the divorce of his parents when he was just two years old. He lived with his father, a judge, and barely saw his mother until he was 15. When the family moved to a remote town in the north of Sweden, the young Mankell immersed himself in books, reading extensively about Africa, and learned that imagination could be an instrument of survival, not just of creativity. ""In my mind I created another mother for myself to replace the one who had left,"" he once said. ""And I think this was me at my best, when the forces of imagination had the same value as the real world."" Unimpressed by school, he left at the age of 16 to join the merchant navy, becoming a stevedore labourer on a Swedish ship carrying coal and iron ore. Two years later, he set up home in Paris, barely scraping a living (""I don't know how I survived,"" he said) but thriving on the student activism and political debate After a year and a half, he returned to Stockholm to work as a stagehand. There, aged 20, he wrote his first play, The Amusement Park, about Swedish colonial interests in 19th Century South America. His debut novel, The Stone-Blaster, soon followed. Kurt Wallander first appeared in 1989's Faceless Killers, investigating a murder in which the only clue is that the perpetrators appear to have been foreigners. When that information was leaked to the public, it triggered a series of racially-motivated attacks, explored in the book through the themes of racism and national identity in Sweden. At first, the author was unaware he had created a recurring character, ""but then I realised after two or three novels that I had this… instrument who could be useful"". Speaking to the Telegraph in 2011, he said: ""I wanted to show how difficult it is to be a good police officer. But after, I think, the third novel, I spoke to this friend of mine and asked what sort of disease I could give him. Without hesitating, she said: 'Diabetes!' So I gave him diabetes and that made him more popular. ""I mean, you could never imagine James Bond giving himself a shot of insulin, but with Wallander it seemed perfectly natural."" Although he became known as a leading proponent of ""Scandi Crime"", Mankell was not a fan of genre fiction. ""I could never write a crime story just for the sake of it, because I always want to talk about certain things,"" he said, citing Macbeth as the best crime story he had ever read, and John Le Carre as a key influence. ""He investigates the contradictions inside man, between men, and between man and society; and I hope to do the same,"" he told The Guardian. Sir Kenneth tried to bring the same gravitas to his TV portrayal of the detective. ""We're not taking lightly the idea of people being murdered,"" he told the BBC in 2010. ""Wallander demands that he and his colleagues care and the drama invites the audience to do the same."" 'Catastrophe' Throughout his adult life, Mankell divided his time between Sweden and Mozambique, where he ran a theatre company and devoted time to the fight against Aids. He was active in the ""memory books"" project, which encourages parents with HIV to record their stories, not just for their children but for future generations. Shortly after New Year 2014, the author went to see an orthopaedic surgeon in Stockholm with what he assumed was a slipped disc. But tests revealed a tumour in his lung, another in his neck, and evidence the cancer had spread throughout his body. ""It was a catastrophe for me,"" he told US radio station NPR last year. ""Everything that was normal to me up to that point was gone all of a sudden. No one had died of cancer in my family. I had always assumed I'd die of something else."" His survivors include his wife of 17 years, Eva Bergman - the daughter of Ingmar Bergman's second wife, the dancer Ellen Lundstrom - and his son, Jon Mankell, a film producer who helped bring Stieg Larsson's Girl With The Dragon Tattoo series to the big screen.","Swedish crime writer Henning Mankell, best known for his Wallander series, has died aged 67."
"By Lizo MzimbaEntertainment correspondent, BBC News More than 300 girls born in England and Wales last year were named Arya, sharing their name with the well-known Game of Thrones character. That's more than the number of children who received traditional names like Mary (204) and Catherine (163). Another name from the HBO series growing in popularity is Khaleesi. There were 69 girls born last year with the same name as the would-be Queen of Westeros, according to figures for England and Wales from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). More Game of Thrones names on the list include Tyrion (11), Sansa (5), Daenerys (4) and Brienne (3). No children were given the name of the evil character Joffrey. Other names from the world of myth and legend are also becoming more commonplace, with 90 boys being called Loki, presumably because of the popularity of the Marvel villain played by Tom Hiddleston. But his brother Thor only shares his name with 18 boys born in 2016. The parents of some of the 16 boys named Kal-El could well be fans of Superman - Kal-El is the real name of the superhero from Krypton. The return of Star Wars in 2015 may have influenced some name choices. Last year, 54 boys were called Kylo, and 17 girls were named Rey. In addition 12 boys were given the name Anakin, the real first name of Darth Vader. The name Hermione, now most associated with Harry Potter, also makes the list, with 95 girls sharing their name with Harry's intelligent, loyal friend. The name peaked in 2004 when the popularity of the Harry Potter books and films was at its height. It's possible that this year's spike is related to the 2016 launch of the hugely successful West End stage show, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. And following the death of one of entertainment's best known figures at the start of last year, there's been an increase in the number of children (seven girls and 35 boys) being named Bowie.

"It happened while they were shooting a scene for Kramer vs Kramer - and Streep says she had no prior warning. Speaking to the New York Times, she also addressed claims she was ""deliberately silent"" over accusations made against Harvey Weinstein. ""I don't want to hear about the silence of me. I want to hear about the silence of Melania Trump,"" she said. Streep, being interviewed alongside Tom Hanks about their new film The Post, added: ""I want to hear from her. ""She has so much that's valuable to say. And so does Ivanka. I want her to speak now."" Referring to the 1979 scene with Hoffman, Streep said: ""This is tricky because when you're an actor, you're in a scene, you have to feel free. I'm sure that I have inadvertently hurt people in physical scenes. But there's a certain amount of forgiveness in that. ""But this was my first movie, and it was my first take in my first movie, and he just slapped me. And you see it in the movie. It was overstepping. ""But I think those things are being corrected in this moment. And they're not politically corrected; they're fixed. They will be fixed, because people won't accept it anymore. So that's a good thing."" Hoffman has previously said he was getting a divorce while shooting the film - about a divorce. ""I'm sure I was acting out on her [Streep] throughout the movie,"" he told the Huffington Post. ""Stuff that I was feeling toward the wife that I was divorcing in real life."" Hoffman has been accused of sexual misconduct by several women. He has apologised to the first to come forward, author Anna Graham Hunter, saying: ""I have the utmost respect for women and feel terrible that anything I might have done could have put her in an uncomfortable situation. I am sorry. It is not reflective of who I am."" 'Respect us as equals' Streep, who has starred in several Harvey Weinstein films, also referred to the scandal which has engulfed the film producer. Last month, she offered a robust defence to an accusation by actress Rose McGowan, who suggested Streep had been deliberately silent about Weinstein. McGowan has alleged that she was raped by Weinstein. Streep said in the New York Times interview: ""I really had to think (about the Weinstein allegations). Because it really underlined my own sense of cluelessness, and also how evil, deeply evil, and duplicitous, a person he [Weinstein] was, yet such a champion of really great work. ""You make movies. You think you know everything about everybody. So much gossip. You don't know anything. People are so inscrutable on a certain level."" She added: ""And it's a shock. Some of my favourite people have been brought down by this, and he's not one of them."" Weinstein has denied all allegations of non-consensual sex made against him. Streep said she had ""experienced things"" in the industry when she was younger - saying there was a lot of ""inexcusable"" behaviour at the time. ""I was really beaten up, but I don't want to ruin somebody's mature life,"" she said. ""I just don't. I do think if the world is going to go on, we have to find out a way to work together, and know that it's better for men if they respect us deeply as equals.""

"The study, conducted by San Diego State University, looked at the top 250 films at the US box office in 2017. Overall, it found that women comprised just 18% of directors, writers, producers, executive producers, editors and cinematographers. That figure is barely higher than the 17% who held such roles 20 years ago, in 1998. The most successful film with a female director in 2017 was Patty Jenkins' Wonder Woman - the ninth top-grossing film of the year.

"He was in charge when the programme dropped an investigation into disgraced TV presenter and DJ Jimmy Savile. Mr Rippon will help to build a public record of the corporation's television and radio journalism over 80 years. BBC Online and Future Media's chief operating officer Andy Conroy described the post as an ""exciting opportunity"". ""It is a significant challenge that requires an experienced leader and editor, and I'm delighted that Peter will be joining us to develop the BBC's Journal of Record,"" said Mr Conroy.

The Journal of Record plans to publish a television and radio news bulletin from every day of the BBC's history, in the form of daily news broadcasts and scripts, together with the live coverage of key events. Movement Mr Rippon, who took the helm of Newsnight in 2008, takes up the new post in London on 25 February.

"Leaving Neverland will premiere at the Sundance Film Festival this month and includes interviews with two alleged victims of Jackson. Representatives for Jackson's estate have responded in a statement. ""This is yet another lurid production in an outrageous and pathetic attempt to exploit and cash in on Michael Jackson,"" it said. Two men who appear in the film say they were aged seven and 10 when Jackson befriended them and their families. Now in their 30s, they allege they were sexually abused by the late singer.

"By Shaun LeyPresenter, BBC Radio 4 The 1965 and 1967 episodes star William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton, the first two actors to play The Doctor. They are among more than 100 instalments which were not retained by the BBC. The announcement was made on Sunday at Missing Believed Wiped, an event held at the British Film Institute (BFI). The BFI, based in London, has been working with broadcasters and film collectors to recover missing recordings of many different television series. Television programmes only began to be routinely recorded in the late 1950s. Previously, they were broadcast live. Even when it became possible to make recordings, video tape was so expensive that most transmission tapes were wiped, so they could be re-used. In the 1970s, the BBC commissioned a report by the historian Lord Briggs. His findings prompted efforts to improve the archiving of television programmes. Although original transmission tapes did not survive, programmes were transferred on to film for broadcasters abroad and it is these prints that the BFI sometimes recover. Doctor Who was sold all over the world in the 1960s. The latest two episodes to be found were in the private collection of a retired broadcast engineer, Terry Burnett, who bought them at a school fete in Hampshire in the 1980s. Mr Burnett had no idea the BBC did not have the recordings - it was only when he mentioned them casually in conversation to Ralph Montagu, head of heritage at Radio Times, that their significance was recognised. Airlock is the third episode of a four-part story called Galaxy Four, transmitted in the autumn of 1965. Hartnell is accompanied by Peter Purves, later a presenter on the children's series Blue Peter, and Maureen O'Brien, now better known as a novelist. The plot involves the desperate attempts by the Drahvins, a race of cloned females, to escape a planet which is about to explode. The story also marks the only appearance in the series of tiny robots known as the Chumblies. The other re-discovered episode is the second part of The Underwater Menace, from early 1967. It sees a mad scientist attempting to restore Atlantis by draining the ocean into the Earth's core. Patrick Troughton, in only his third appearance as The Doctor, was apparently unimpressed with the production. In a recent biography, his son Michael says he argued with the director Julia Smith - who went on to become the original producer of EastEnders - complaining bitterly about the ""ridiculous costumes and make-up of the fish people"". Innes Lloyd, who produced The Underwater Menace later admitted, ""it did look like something from a '50s American 'B' movie"". The find makes only a modest dent in the number of missing episodes, with 106 instalments broadcast between 1964 and 1969 still being sought. Among other items recovered and shown at Sunday's event were Emergency Ward 9, a play by Dennis Potter, and a comedy sketch featuring Peter Cook and Dudley Moore.",Doctor Who fans are getting a fresh opportunity to travel back in time with the discovery of two missing episodes from the long-running BBC series.
"Eon Productions said he had had a ""minor procedure"" in New York during a break in production over Easter. A spokeswoman denied reports the 47-year-old had missed several days of filming on the 24th Bond film, Spectre. ""During a scheduled break, Daniel Craig had arthroscopic surgery to repair his knee injury. He will rejoin production on April 22nd at Pinewood,"" she said. Filming on Spectre began at Pinewood Studios, in Buckinghamshire, last December, and has since moved to Rome and Mexico. It is Craig's fourth outing as the secret service agent, and follows the success of 2012's Skyfall, which made $1.1 billion (£737 million) worldwide.

"By Mark SavageBBC music reporter The musician was best known as the founder and director of choral group Ladysmith Black Mambazo, which won five Grammy awards and featured heavily on Paul Simon's Graceland album. They also reached number 15 in the UK charts with a cover of Swing Low Sweet Chariot, for the 1995 Rugby World Cup. Shabalala died in hospital in Pretoria, South Africa, the band's manager said. ""Yes it's true. Mr Shabalala passed on this morning,"" Xolani Majozi told the South Africa Times. ""The group is on tour in the US, but they have been informed and are devastated because the group is family."" In a statement, the band said: ""We celebrate and honour your kind heart and your extraordinary life. Through your music and the millions who you came in contact with, you shall live forever."" The South African government paid tribute to the musician in a tweet, saying: ""We would like to extend our condolences on the passing of Joseph Shabalala who was the founder of the group Ladysmith Black Mambazo. It added in Xhosa, ""Ulale ngoxolo Tata ugqatso lwakho ulufezile."" (Rest in peace, father, your race is complete.) Born in 1941, Shabalala was the eldest of eight children living on a farm in Tugela, near the town of Ladysmith in South Africa. ""When I was a young boy I dreamt of becoming an educated person; maybe a teacher, doctor or something like that,"" he told South Africa's The Citizen in 2014. However, he was forced to leave school at the age of 12 when his father died, working on the family farm and, later, in a local factory. In his spare time, he would sing with friends in a local group called the Blacks. ""The young boys when they get together, they started to sing the songs, until the mamas and the neighbours said, 'Hey, do it again,'"" he told the BBC. ""It was just like that. They were calling, 'Do it again, do it again'."" He eventually became the leader and main composer for the choir, fusing indigenous Zulu songs and dances with South African isicathamiya, an a capella tradition that was frequently accompanied by a soft, shuffling style of dance. They were re-christened Ladysmith Black Mambazo, a name that was significant on several levels: Ladysmith represented their hometown, Black referenced the black oxen that were the strongest on the farm, and Mambazo, from the Zulu word for axe, symbolized the group's ability to cut down the competition. A radio performance in 1970 led to a recording contract, and in 1973 they released Africa's first gold-selling album, Amabutho. They achieved global recognition after being recruited to sing on Paul Simon's multi-million-selling Graceland album, most notably on Homeless, a song Shabalala co-wrote with Simon, based on the melody for a traditional Zulu wedding song. The band joined Simon on his subsequent world tour. In return, he produced their next three albums - with 1987's Shaka Zulu winning a Grammy for best traditional folk recording. Shabalala retired from active performance in 2014 shortly after performing at a memorial concert for Nelson Mandela. He continued to teach traditional choral music, while four of his sons (and one grandson) continued his legacy within Ladysmith Black Mambazo. The musician was with his wife Thokozile Shabalala, in his final moments, said Xolani Majozi. As news of his death spread, tributes poured in from around the world. ""My friend, a giant humble man, Joseph Shabalala, passed away this morning,"" wrote South African singer Sipho ""Hotstix"" Mabuse on Twitter. ""My sincere condolences to his family and friends."" ""I am deeply saddened,"" wrote Herman Mashaba, former mayor of Johannesburg. ""You will be remembered as a giant of South African music and a pioneer of the industry."" Analysis - Nomsa Maseko, BBC News, Johannesburg I met the world-renowned musician Joseph Shabalala in Umlazi township in KwaZulu-Natal province a few days before Christmas in 2015. His home was a hive of activity. Even though he was looking frail, he was teaching traditional choral music to a group of young people who were clearly eager to learn from him. He was singing Homeless, a song he co-wrote with Paul Simon. He was wearing a red t-shirt and stood in front of a microphone and pulled his famous isicathamiya dance moves.

"The comedian is running a marathon a day for the next 27 days - one for each year Nelson Mandela spent in prison. ""The first 10 are always the hardest, but then your body and your brain gets used to it so it gets easier,"" he told the BBC. Izzard previously attempted a similar feat in South Africa in 2012, but had to pull out for health reasons. ""What I'm doing is not particularly special here, other people have done more crazy things,"" he said. The 54-year-old tweeted a photo of himself standing by the Mbashe river in South Africa's Eastern Cape province as he began his marathon at 06:30 local time. But a few hours later, Sport Relief themselves tweeted: ""16 miles done and a little work on the feet needed,"" with a picture of Izzard taking a short break. At around 1500 local time (1300 GMT), Sport Relief tweeted: ""Marathon one DONE by the astonishing @eddieizzard"". How will 27 marathons affect Eddie Izzard? When asked what he'd done to physically prepare for the challenge, Izzard said: ""You can't really train for 27 marathons, it's mental training."" ""It's about getting your health into the right place, eating the right food, and getting mentally prepared for it. ""There's no luck in it, you make your own luck really."" When asked how he'd altered his diet, Izzard explained: ""Once you get yourself off refined sugar, you do get to a much better place."" Follow Eddie Izzard's 27 marathon challenge One of the biggest challenges he faces while running the marathons is the hot climate in South Africa. ""It's like two British summers squashed together and multiplied with a cooker. I think we're at 30C already, and it's 10am here,"" he said. He joked that he ""doesn't actually like running"", adding that he's trying to find things to keep him entertained along the way. ""I like stopping and talking to donkeys, goats, cows, dogs - I've just been to Mvezo which is the birthplace of Nelson Mandela."" Mandela was President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999 before his death in 2013 aged 95.",Eddie Izzard has completed the first of the 27 marathons he is running for Sport Relief.
"By Mark SavageBBC Music reporter Whiley will be the first female DJ on the station's weekday daytime schedule for 20 years. Debbie Thrower was the last, presenting Radio 2's afternoon show between 1995 and 1998. At a time when pay equality is under scrutiny at the BBC, Radio 2 confirmed Mayo and Whiley will earn the same. In other changes to the station's line-up, Sara Cox will present a new show from 22:00 to midnight every Monday to Thursday. Gary Davies replaces Cox on the popular Sound of the 80s programme while 6 Music's Cerys Matthews takes over the Blues Show from Paul Jones, who leaves the station after more than 30 years. The Arts Show will be ending, as will The Organist Entertains - which has been on the network for almost 50 years. Presenter Nigel Ogden thanked listeners for supporting the show over the last five decades. ""I've loved hearing from them and send them my very best wishes for the future. I'd also like to thank Radio 2 for giving me the opportunity to play the music I love each week. It has been a huge privilege."" Listen to the Band is also being taken off the air. Radio 2 says brass band music will continue to be played elsewhere. The changes, which come into effect from 14 May, also see Robot Wars presenter Angela Scanlon added to the Sunday morning schedule, and OJ Borg presenting a live overnight show on weekdays. 'What a thrill' Whiley, who joined Radio 2 in 2011, currently hosts a weeknight show specialising in new music. She started her career as a researcher on Channel 4's The Word and hosted Radio 1's Evening Session with Steve Lamacq at the height of Britpop. The new drivetime show is the first time she has shared the microphone with Mayo. ""Although we've known each other for over 20 years, we've never presented a show together,"" said Mayo in a statement. ""And given that Jo is quite brilliant, it's high time we put that right."" ""What a thrill to be working with Simon on this exciting new show,"" added Whiley. ""It's going to be great fun and listeners can look forward to some incredible music and chat, as well as being introduced to some fantastic new talent along the way. Cannot wait! "" Their pairing results in an extra hour of radio, with the drivetime slot extended from 17:00 to 20:00 every weekday, except Friday - when Tony Blackburn's Golden Hour remains from 19:00 to 20:00. As a result, the weekly Blues, Jazz, Folk and Country shows will move one hour later - starting at 20:00 from Monday to Thursday. According to figures published by the BBC last July, Mayo currently receives a salary in the range £350,000 - £399,999, while Whiley is paid £150,000 - £199,999. Although they will receive equal pay for their upcoming show, there will still be a disparity in their total salaries, as Mayo presents a weekly show for 5 Live, and Whiley hosts events including Glastonbury for BBC television.

"By Steven McIntoshEntertainment reporter But there was plenty more to enjoy about Sunday's Golden Globe Awards beyond the comedy duo's excellent bicoastal hosting. Nomadland and Borat Subsequent Moviefilm were the big winners of the night, while The Crown dominated the TV categories. Meanwhile, there were three significant surprises in the film categories - with Andra Day, Rosamund Pike and Jodie Foster all beating the favourites in their respective acting groups to claim victory. Mank was the most nominated film of the night and yet went home empty-handed, which may not bode well for its Oscar chances next month. But the biggest surprise was that the Golden Globes almost finished on time, running only a few minutes late (it's usually at least half an hour). Here are nine highlights from the ceremony: 1. Ben Stiller can bake you a Golden Globe ""It's hard to believe it's been a full year since the last Golden Globes,"" said Ben Stiller as he took to the stage to present the award for best actress in a musical or comedy. ""But, like many of us, I've used that time to look inward and grow. I've come to fully understand the nature of crypto-currency. I read a book. I finally got around to dying my hair grey."" It turns out the actor's biggest lockdown achievement, however, has been sculpting awards trophies out of cake. ""Like so many other resilient Americans, I learned to bake. A delicious banana bread, in the form of a Golden Globe."" 2. Tina and Amy roasted the nominees Without having a full live audience or even being in the same room, the pair couldn't quite match their usual high standards - but they certainly gave it their best shot. The former Saturday Night Live stars poked fun at several of the nominees. Here are some of their best one-liners: 3. The virtual ceremony had a few hiccups The recurring theme of the night was winners spending half their acceptance speech asking: ""Am I on? Do I speak now? Can you hear me?"" There were numerous technical glitches, including the first winner of the night, Daniel Kaluuya, being muted (it wasn't clear if this was because of him or the Globes sound engineer). After being announced as the winner of best supporting actor, he began delivering a silent acceptance speech. Category presenter Laura Dern cut in to apologise for the sound problems and started to wrap up. ""As you can see, we unfortunately have a bad connection, we apologise for that technical problem, and send all our congratulations to Daniel."" But the British star was not to be silenced and suddenly sprung to life. ""Wait! You're doing me dirty, you're doing me dirty!"" he shouted, suddenly audible. ""Can you hear me now? All right, cool."" Kaluuya is normally one of the smoothest, most unflappable men in showbiz, so it was quite something to watch him flat-out refuse to be defeated by a dodgy Zoom connection. 4. Jodie Foster thanked her dog ...But only after she had expressed genuine shock at winning best supporting actress for her performance in The Mauritanian. ""No way! Oh my god. Are you kidding me? I think you made a mistake,"" she exclaimed as her name was announced. ""I'm a little speechless, I just never expected to ever be here again."" Foster has previously won Golden Globes for her performances in The Accused and Silence of the Lambs. Wearing some truly magnificent pyjamas, Foster thanked her wife, Alexandra Hedison, her adorable-looking dog Ziggy... and Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers. ""I love my wife, thank you Alex, and Ziggy, and Aaron Rodgers and the Hollywood Foreign Press. This is awesome!"" (Foster is a huge fan of the Packers, and Rodgers mentioned her in a speech last month, so she was returning the favour. He's also the fiancé of her Mauritanian co-star Shailene Woodley.) 5. Catherine O'Hara was played off (by her husband) Schitt's Creek couldn't quite equal the success it enjoyed at the Emmys, where it swept up in every category it was nominated, but it still picked up a couple of Globes. One was best comedy series, which was accepted by Dan Levy, while his co-star Catherine O'Hara won her first ever Globe for best comedy actress. Her acceptance speech started out normally enough - she thanked the HFPA, her fellow nominees and the Schitt's Creek cast and crew. Now, usually when a winner starts to drone on a bit, they're not-so-subtly played off by the orchestra. But with nobody there to hurry her along, O'Hara's husband Bo Welch took matters into his own hands with a series of sound effects on his phone. He used an applause sound effect after she was announced as the winner, but after she had been speaking for a full minute, Welch started playing loud music to remind his dearly beloved wife to wrap it up. O'Hara dealt with this beautifully and began actually singing along with the iPhone orchestra as she drew her acceptance speech to a close. 6. Chadwick Boseman's wife gave an emotional speech Perhaps the most moving moment of the night came from Taylor Simone Ledward, who accepted an award on behalf of her late husband, Chadwick Boseman. The Black Panther star, who died last year, won the prize for best drama actor for his performance in Ma Rainey's Black Bottom. Ledward took the opportunity to imagine the speech he would have given, as category presenter Renée Zellweger became emotional as she watched from the studio. ""He would say something beautiful, something inspiring,"" Ledward said. ""Something that would amplify that little voice inside of all of us that tells you you can, that tells you to keep going, that calls you back to what you're meant to be doing at this moment in history. ""And I don't have his words, but we have to take a moment to celebrate those we love. So thank you HFPA for this opportunity to do exactly that. ""And, hun, you keep 'em coming. Thank you."" 7. Barb and Star have stocked up on merchandise Our two favourite tourists, Barb and Star, were extremely excited to be presenting best comedy and musical film. Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo, stars of Barb And Star Go To Vista Del Mar, turned up in their sparkly outfits with plenty of LA souvenirs in their bags. ""We have been in Hollywood for two weeks, and Hollywood Boulevard is the place to be, so many LA shops,"" said Barb. ""My favourite was the Hollywood trinket zone."" ""My favourites were Hollywood T-shirt store, and Hollywood Souvenir and T-shirt,"" offered Star. ""You know what I got? And oversized $1 bill with Darth Vader as the president,"" she added, sounding more excited than any of the night's winners. 8. Aaron Sorkin got a lot of emails from Sacha Baron Cohen The writer and director of The Trial of the Chicago 7 expertly managed to roll humour and politics into his acceptance speech for best screenplay, while also referencing the film's star Sacha Baron Cohen. The actor, who also won prizes for Borat Subsequent Moviefilm at Sunday's Globes, played political activist Abbie Hoffman in Sorkin's film. ""While we were shooting, every night after we wrapped when I'd get back to my hotel room, there'd be an email from Sacha with a quote from Abbie Hoffman,"" Sorkin explained. ""None of them ever made it into the film, but I saved the emails."" Sorkin clarified he doesn't always agree with everything his characters do or say, but went on to quote one particular speech from Hoffman. ""Democracy is not something you believe in, or a place to hang your hat, but it's something you do. You participate. If you stop doing it, democracy crumbles."" Linking Hoffman's speech to the deadly Capitol riot earlier this year, Sorkin concluded: ""I don't need any more evidence than what happened on 6 January to agree with this."" 9. Tracy Morgan is off to order a pizza There's a small chance Fey's former 30 Rock co-star Tracy Morgan didn't properly prepare for his job presenting best original score. While most people would practise the pronunciations of all the the possible winners to make sure they didn't trip up, Morgan took a stab in the dark. And not even with a particularly complicated name. He pronounced Pixar's animated movie ""Soul"" as ""Sal."" You kind of have to see it to believe it. He did at least offer some form of explanation on Twitter afterwards. Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

"By Mark SavageBBC Music reporter Sometimes an artist will leave behind a great, complete record - like Notorious BIG's Life After Death or Joy Division's Closer. Others are cobbled together from studio scraps and incomplete demos - think Amy Winehouse's Lioness or Michael Jackson's Xscape. A third type mines a seemingly infinite vault of archive recordings, as we've seen with Jimi Hendrix, Tupac Shakur and Prince. All of them face the same pitfall. Try to second-guess the artist's intentions and you can end up making compromises and creative decisions that damage their integrity and legacy. That's exactly the issue that faced the surviving members of The Cranberries after the untimely death of their singer Dolores O'Riordan last year. Their eighth album was beginning to take shape when the 46-year-old was found drowned in the bath at London's Park Lane Hilton hotel. She had recorded demos for 11 songs in the preceding months in a flurry of creativity her bandmates sometimes struggled to keep up with. Her distinctive voice had never sounded better, conveying a mixture of sadness and hope on a collection of songs dealing with themes of loss and moving on. ""She was very excited about the album and very passionate about it, so she really gave it everything on those demos,"" says guitarist Noel Hogan. After O'Riordan's funeral in Limerick last January, the band got together to review the new material, ""and we started to realise, when you listen to the songs back-to-back, how full a piece of work it was"". With some trepidation, they decided to complete the album - bringing in producer Stephen Street, who had overseen their first two records, to help flesh out the songs. ""We've been very, very careful,"" says Noel. ""A lot of [posthumous] albums that get released by record companies are a patchwork of this and that… and it just seems like people are cashing in. ""But this was genuinely for the love of it, and to finish what we had started with Dolores."" The result, In The End, is a worthy epitaph - a collection of heartfelt, heartbreaking songs that capture O'Riordan's fragility and fierceness, and resist any temptation towards sentimentality. ""If people think in years to come that it was the four of us in one room, recording this album - that's the best we could hope for,"" says Noel, who sat down with bassist and youngest brother Mike and drummer Fergal Lawler to discuss the frequently emotional task of putting the record together. At the start of 2018, what stage was the album at? Noel: It was at the demo stage, but obviously we had the vocals, which are the most important thing at that point. Were her demos always that strong? Mike: Yes, she gave it everything and that's the way she always was. It seems like the songs were almost complete. Noel: That was our stipulation going into the studio - that we wouldn't use any bits and pieces and scrap it together. Because there were a few extra songs that maybe had a bit of a verse or a vocal from a chorus but we didn't want to use those. It would have seemed like we were milking her and that would have been disrespectful. Going back into the studio must have been tough. What was it like to hear her voice again? Noel: It was very emotional because it was only April last year. That's two months after Dolores passed away, so you're still in disbelief, but then to walk in every morning and put the headphones on, and there's Dolores again - like she's almost alive, still, singing at you - it was hard to get your head around it. But as the weeks went on, we started to realise that moping around thinking negative thoughts isn't going to do the songs justice. You've got to come up with ideas, you've got to make the songs the best they can be. Once we got in that frame of mind, it definitely helped. During the writing phase, what were the themes Dolores was thinking about? Noel: It was mostly about what was going on in her life up to 2017. She'd been recently divorced, and she had been diagnosed with bipolar. She had an ongoing problem with her back as well, which interfered with touring. So all these things had been going on and she finally felt she could put them behind her. It's just unfortunate that, with everything that's happened since then, people might look at it a different way. Yes, these songs were clearly not written as an epitaph. Noel: Some people will see that in it, but Dolores didn't have a crystal ball. She couldn't see into the future, she had absolutely no way of knowing what was going to happen. So she was just writing this album and hopefully would have gone on to write many more. The title track, In The End, is very moving. It seems to tell the story of the band. Noel: That song is so apt in many ways for the band and for the album. It was the perfect song to finish the recording sessions with, because I think the three of us knew that was the last time we'd be in a studio together working on a Cranberries album. You know, even before we even met Dolores, we'd left school and started this band and we've been playing together ever since. So this was a nice way to finish up that long 30 years together. What were your first impressions of Dolores, all those years ago? Mike: We used to rehearse in a studio in Limerick, and she showed up to an audition with a keyboard, kind of shy-like but very confident in her singing. Noel had the chord sequence for Linger, so we gave her a tape with Linger on it and she came back about a week later with the lyrics finished and started singing it to us. We were blown away. Fame didn't always sit well with Dolores. How did you look after each other on the road? Noel: We'd always watch each other's backs, especially for Dolores. She'd feel the pressure of everyone wanting a piece of her, and wanting to do interviews and photo sessions. So we'd always offer our assistance: ""Do you want one of us to sit in with you?"" or ""Do you want one of us to do it instead of you?"" We always had that support, because she did find it very hard. We didn't envy her at all. Now that the album's out, have you given any consideration to what comes next? Fergal: It's really hard to put it into words, because it felt like this day would never come and now that we're here, it will probably hit us a bit more. Normally at this point, you'd be getting ready to tour for the next two years, and unfortunately we can't do that. Noel: It isn't something we've really thought about because we've been so busy. The one thing we can agree on is we all still want to do music. It's really hard to turn your back on it after doing it this long. So I guess after the summer, we'll make decisions on what it is we do next. The response to the album has been really positive, which must be satisfying. Noel: It's been amazing. For us, it validates what we did. It shows that we did the right thing. We didn't want to destroy the legacy of the band.

"The Manchester-based orchestra won the contemporary and choral prizes at the prestigious event in London. Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel, the musical director of the acclaimed Simon Bolivar Youth Orchestra, was named artist of the year. Czech string quartet the Pavel Haas Quartet won recording of the year. The winners were announced at a ceremony at London's Dorchester Hotel on Thursday. The Halle, led by music director Sir Mark Elder, took the choral prize for their recording of Elgar's The Kingdom. Gramophone reviewer Andrew Achenbach praised Sir Mark's ""unerring grasp of the bigger scheme and scrupulous attention to dynamic and textual nuance [that] make for profoundly nourishing results"". The orchestra won the contemporary prize for Sir Harrison Birtwistle's Night's Black Bird, conducted by Ryan Wigglesworth. Last year, the Halle picked up the concerto and opera prizes. The City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra is the only other orchestra to have won four awards over two years, under Sir Simon Rattle's leadership in 1995 and 96. Gustavo Dudamel, meanwhile, was praised for his ""charismatic ability to inspire a life-long passion for music in young people, together with his passionate energy on the podium"". Dudamel is one of the most celebrated products and proponents of the Venezuelan El Sistema music education system, and is also music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic and the Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra. The Pavel Haas Quartet, founded in Prague in 2002, was judged by 47 Gramophone magazine critics to have made the best album of the year playing Dvorak Quartets Nos. 12 and 13. The quartet also won the chamber award. Conductor Sir John Eliot Gardiner received a special achievement award for his Bach Cantata Pilgrimage, a project to perform all of JS Bach's surviving church cantatas on the relevant feast days. Mezzo-soprano Dame Janet Baker received a lifetime achievement award, while recordings by conductor Antonio Pappano won the editor's choice and the DVD awards.","The Halle Orchestra has picked up two prizes at the 2011 Gramophone magazine awards, following a double win at the same ceremony last year."
"By Ian YoungsArts & entertainment reporter The puppets come from the archive of animation studio Cosgrove Hall, which made shows like The Wind in the Willows and Chorlton and the Wheelies. A project has begun to preserve and display the Cosgrove Hall archive. Sixty percent of the latex puppets, including characters from The Wind in the Willows, are ""at serious risk"". And 20% are past saving, according to Westley Wood, a former Cosgrove Hall employee who has rescued the treasure trove. Cosgrove Hall also made such classic shows as Danger Mouse, Count Duckula, Terry Pratchett's Truckers and Noddy's Toyland Adventures. But its characters were put into storage when the studio shut in 2009. Some of the better-preserved items of memorabilia are now going on display in an exhibition at the Waterside Arts Centre in Sale, Manchester. According to Wood, the hand-drawn acetate cells used to animate the likes of Danger Mouse and Count Duckula have lasted well. But the 3D puppets that were employed in stop-motion animations have deteriorated with age, with parts of the latex falling off some to expose the steel skeletons beneath. ""The film cells are well preserved,"" said Wood. ""They can be saved quite easily. But unfortunately a lot of the puppets were made of foam latex, and over time it dries out. ""As they've all dried out and become quite stiff, these puppets have started losing half of their face or part of their arm. ""There's a big process at the moment of identifying important pieces in the collection, and ones which we think need immediate restoration. ""At least 60% of it is at serious risk and at least 20% of that is past being saved,"" he went on. ""It's in a pretty bad way."" The archive has been awarded a £42,000 grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund, with contributions from Sale Waterside and Arts Council England taking the fund over £50,000. But that won't stretch to restoring the hundreds of items in the archive. ""To restore everything would probably cost millions, unfortunately, so we need to identify key pieces that we think have significant cultural heritage,"" said Wood, while insisting the deterioration was ""nobody's fault"". ""Personally I'd love to restore it all, but that's just not possible at this stage."" The Cosgrove Hall exhibition at Sale Waterside runs from 21 October to 17 February.

"By Fiona BaileyEntertainment reporter, BBC News The couple, who worked together for 21 years on shows like ITV's This Morning, said they had no plans to come back to television - together or apart. ""I've had two propositions in the last year to go back and do something on my own, but the answer is an absolute no,"" Madeley said. Finnigan added she had no immediate plans to return to broadcasting at all. 'Set free' Madeley, who has been presenting a Radio 2 show and will appear as a subject on Who Do You Think You Are, said his wife had ""pulled back from broadcasting completely for the time being"". He added: ""Some people come up to us and ask whether we miss doing daytime television. ""But I have to say 'not in the slightest'. I'd say the last year professionally has been the most enjoyable I can remember. It's been like being set free."" Finnigan said that the broadcasting environment had changed since their heyday, and that producers were now ""frightened about taking risks"". ""I don't think the kind of shows that we made for This Morning and Channel 4 are possible anymore because it cost a lot of money,"" Madeley said. ""One of the reasons we decided to leave Channel 4 is [that] we could see the budgets would have to come down - and to make a good show it costs money. ""And that wasn't our wages, that money went on screen - on high quality videos, on bringing guests over the Atlantic, on high production values in studio and a big team. ""The money isn't there anymore. They have to make it on the cheap and you don't get the quality that we were able to deliver."" The duo shot to fame in 1988, broadcasting daytime programme This Morning from Liverpool, two years after they married. They were last seen on digital channel Watch in 2009, where their audience dropped as low as 8,000. The couple have now turned their attention to their Book Club, which was launched on Wednesday.",Presenters Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan have categorically ruled out a return to daytime TV.
"By Emma JonesEntertainment reporter, BBC News ""Tally ho!,"" shouts American Pie actress Jennifer Coolidge in Jane Austen send-up, Austenland, which premiered this weekend. ""The British are coming!"" She appears to have got that right in the case of Austenland, which is about a woman so obsessed with the 1996 BBC production of Pride and Prejudice that she journeys to England to find her Mr Darcy. It is directed by Jerusha Hess, who - along with her husband Jared - directed surprise 2004 hit Napoleon Dynamite, and has a mainly British cast and crew, and was filmed on location in the UK. With rave reviews from audiences, it's being touted as this summer's Bridesmaids - although this low-budget, independent film can currently only dream of those kinds of profits. Hess says she prefers to think of it as ""the anti-Downton Abbey"". ""Everyone in the US is so obsessed with British costume drama and here we are as a costume drama comedy. But sometimes we forget that Jane Austen herself was a comedic genius. I think she'd like to see someone ripping it out of her work."" Independent platform This is what the Sundance Film Festival is famous for - transforming the fortunes of made-on-a-shoestring movies and giving them a platform for commercial success. Its latest example is Beasts of the Southern Wild by Benh Zeitlin, which had its world premiere at Sundance in 2012, and now has four Oscar nominations. Similarly, all the documentaries nominated at this year's Academy Awards screened at Sundance. Started in 1985 in the ski-resort of Park City, Utah by actor Robert Redford, this year it has 57 world premieres and half of all the films in competition are made by women - a first for any film festival. ""If you have an independent film, you want to bring it to Sundance,"" explains actor Daniel Radcliffe. "" No other place can do such big things for a tiny movie."" Radcliffe is another competitor at this year's event, for John Krokidas's feature film debut, Kill Your Darlings. The former child star plays beat poet Allen Ginsberg as a young student in the throes of literary revolution, along with his contemporaries Jack Kerouac and William Burroughs. He auditioned for the part four years ago when he was still filming the Harry Potter series. ""We did everything wrong on this film, basically, "" he says. "" We had no budget, and yet it was a period drama set in lavish locations. Somehow we've pulled it off. Honestly, I think it's the very best thing I have ever done."" Critics seemed inclined to agree, calling the movie, ""the Social Network for the Beat generation"" - although without Radcliffe's presence, the film may have struggled for more column inches. His presence is another indicator of how popular the event is with big stars. Over the first weekend of the festival, it has featured a line-up that the Cannes Film Festival would envy - Nicole Kidman, Naomi Watts, Julianne Moore, Matthew McConaughey and Joseph Gordon-Levitt have braved the freezing temperatures and utilitarian venues to premiere their movies. They are joined by film producers and talent managers, leading to Park City to be described during the festival as ""LA on snow."" Alongside the major actors are major brands who, on occasion, hand out gifts in Park City, which has led to accusations of the ""Hollywood-isation"" of Sundance - something John Cooper, the festival's Chief Programmer, says is unintentional. ""Because the studios are no longer making many character dramas, these actors have to find their creativity in smaller, often low-budget indie films,"" he explains. ""So really, I suppose Hollywood has come to us. The Dark Knight Rises and Looper star Joseph Gordon-Levitt agrees. He makes his directing debut with Don Jon's Addiction, a comedy examining attitudes to pornography. ""There wouldn't even be independent cinema now in the US without Sundance existing,"" he says. ""There would be no platform for half the films I have made."" Cooper says he was surprised at the amount of sex featured in the submissions for this year's competition - from The Look of Love, Michael Winterbottom's biopic of porn baron Paul Raymond, starring Steve Coogan, to Amanda Seyfried playing one of the most famous porn stars of all time, Linda Lovelace, in another biopic. Documentaries It is the documentary category, however, that usually provokes the biggest headlines of Sundance. This year, After Tiller, a study of four doctors in the USA who provide late-term abortions, was such a controversial subject that metal detectors had to be installed at the premiere for fear of assassination attempts. After Tiller puts a human face to a divisive political issue in the US and there was, according to director Lana Wilson, ""more security than for Nicole Kidman."" Another documentary, Twenty Feet from Stardom puts a face to some of the most nameless people in the music industry, namely backing singers. With commentary from Bruce Springsteen and Sting, it charts the fortunes of artists who've supported Michael Jackson and Stevie Wonder but never managed to find stardom themselves. It became the first film to find a buyer at this year's festival - in this case, producer Harvey Weinstein. Although there was no sign of any of these music stars, one rock star has been spotted around Park City - Dave Grohl, making his directing debut in a documentary, with Sound City - a look at the legendary LA studio where Nirvana recorded their definitive classic album Nevermind. He and the rest of his band The Foo Fighters nearly closed down Park City's tiny Main Street when they played a local pub in celebration of the world premiere. For ten days in January, this small town in Utah really is the biggest place in the entertainment industry. The Sundance Film Festival runs until January 27, 2013. The UK leg will be held in London in April.",A slapstick comedy about a woman obsessed with Pride and Prejudice is a highlight of the first weekend of films at the Sundance Film festival in the US.
"By Mark SavageBBC music reporter Both approaches were valid. Protest songs like Beyoncé's Black Parade and H.E.R's I Can't Breathe felt as necessary to surviving 2020 as the escapism of Taylor Swift's quarantine album Folklore or Dua Lipa's disco opus Future Nostalgia. In the end, the Grammys gave both equal weight. Swift won album of the year; H.E.R. won record of the year. Dua Lipa won best pop album; Beyoncé won best R&B performance. The dynamic continued throughout the show, with a series of performances that emphasised how music had, in the words of host Trevor Noah, ""touched our lives and saved our souls over this unprecedented year"". A new feel And so we saw Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion performing a censored-but-somehow-still-raunchy version of WAP just before Lil Baby delivered his searing Black Lives Matter anthem The Bigger Picture. One of the night's most powerful moments, The Bigger Picture opened with a dramatic re-enactment of Rayshard Brooks' shooting by Atlanta Police officers last June, and incorporated an impassioned speech from US activist Tamika Mallory. ""President Biden, we demand justice, equity, policy and everything else that freedom encompasses,"" she declared. ""And to accomplish this, we don't need allies. We need accomplices."" It was one of the few big set-pieces on a night that ditched the Grammys' preoccupation with razzmatazz, choreography and vocal histrionics, and tried something new - musicians playing their songs. And guess what? It worked. This was the most compelling and watchable Grammys in years. All the awkward pauses and bum notes that usually plague the ceremony were gone. Instead, we got to see Harry Styles walk through an incredibly relaxed rendition of Watermelon Sugar, and Danielle Haim thrash the living daylights out of her drums on a spirited version of The Steps. Of course, the producers were forced into this set-up. Pandemic restrictions meant they couldn't have thousands of dancers or those trademark ""Grammy moments"" where 25 people sing an inexplicable tribute to The Kids From Fame (this actually happened last year). Instead, bands were arranged in a circle of stages inside LA's Convention Center, watching each other play at a safe distance. Every 45 minutes or so, new artists were shuffled in, from Lionel Richie to Miranda Lambert to Doja Cat. It made the show feel intimate and fresh - something it has needed for a long time. A lot of the credit goes to Ben Winston, who took over from long-time show-runner Ken Ehrlich last year. The British producer, who memorably delivered the ""Adele moment"" at the 2011 Brits, said his ambition was to make the show resemble an ""Abbey Road studio session"" inspired by the TV programmes he watched as a child, including TFI Friday and Later... With Jools Holland. Hopefully he can hold his nerve and bring the same sense of spontaneity and relevance to next year's show, even if it goes back to a more regular format. Venues highlighted Winston also made sure the ceremony addressed the hardships the music industry has faced over the past year. Some of the awards were presented by employees of music venues that have been left empty by the pandemic. All of them had the same message. ""When the doors are finally able to open again, it'll be like, 'OK, I can breathe again',"" said Rachelle Erratchu, of LA's legendary Troubador club. An equally poignant moment was the Grammys debut of Mickey Guyton - the only black female country singer signed to a major label - singing her song Black Like Me. ""It's a hard life on easy street / Just white painted picket fences far as you can see / If you think we live in the land of the free / You should try to be black like me."" Her quietly defiant song of resistance felt especially relevant at a time when the country music industry is struggling to address its problems with race and bias. Just last month, best-selling country singer Morgan Wallace was suspended by his record label after a video of him using a racial slur emerged online - but his album remains at the top of the US charts. Guyton is one of the few to publicly rebuke him, tweeting: ""The hate runs deep."" The Grammys have struggled with racial and gender bias themselves in recent years. There is a distinct and justifiable perception that rap, R&B and hip-hop are locked out of the ""big four"" categories - best new artist, song of the year, record of the year and album of the year. That has led to artists like Drake, Frank Ocean and Kanye West boycotting the ceremony in the past. This year, they were joined by The Weekend, who was snubbed in the nominations despite having one of the year's best-selling records. Megan Thee Stallion's victory in the best new artist category may help to reassure musicians that hip-hop isn't being overlooked - but a clearly shocked Billie Eilish noted that her victory in the record of the year category should have gone instead to Megan's breakout single Savage. ""This is really embarrassing for me,"" she said. ""Megan, girl... I was gonna write a speech about how you deserve this but then I was like, 'There's no way they're going to choose me.' ""You deserve this. You had a year that I think is unstoppable. You are a queen. I think about you constantly... You deserve it."" Eilish's speech had echoes of 2017, when Adele was flabbergasted to have beaten Beyoncé in the album of the year category. ""I can't possibly accept this award,"" she said. ""My artist of my life is Beyoncé. And [her] album to me, the Lemonade album, is just so monumental."" It was a moment that I May Destroy You writer and star Michaela Coel called ""a frank admission of privilege"". This Sunday, Beyoncé became the most-awarded woman in Grammy history - but it's noticeable that she hasn't had a victory in any of the big four categories since Single Ladies won song of the year in 2010. In terms of gender representation, however, the Grammys have reversed course since 2018, when the Recording Academy's then-president said women needed to ""step up"" if they wanted to win awards. Women swept the ""big four"" this year, while Megan Thee Stallion became the first female winner of the best rap song prize since its inception in 2004. ""There's been a lot of female empowerment and lots of women are winning awards tonight,"" said Dua Lipa backstage after winning best pop album. ""It's been absolutely amazing to feel that energy."" In the end, however, it was Megan Thee Stallion who summed the night up best. ""Music really helped a lot of us get through the pandemic,"" she said, accepting her best rap song trophy. ""So a shout out to everybody who was here today - because a lot of these songs really pushed us all the way through."" Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

"Day-Lewis's co-stars Tommy Lee Jones and Sally Field have been shortlisted for best supporting actor and actress. However, the film's award-winning director Steven Spielberg missed out in the best director category. Musical adaptation Les Miserables and Ang Lee's Life of Pi have both received nine nominations. Speaking to the BBC's Lizo Mzimba at the announcement, film critic Mark Kermode said: ""As far as Lincoln was concerned, all the attention was on Daniel Day-Lewis. ""Whatever anybody thinks about the film - and the critics have been somewhat divided, everybody thought his performance was captivating and completely believable."" Best of British Following closely behind the leaders pack was Bond film Skyfall with eight nominations, including best British film and best supporting actor and actress for Javier Bardem and Judi Dench. It will battle it out with four other titles to be named outstanding British film at the awards ceremony on 10 February. They were The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, Anna Karenina, Les Miserables, and Seven Psychopaths. The nominations were announced by Alice Eve and Jeremy Irvine at the The British Academy of Film and Television Arts headquarters in London on Wednesday. Anne Hathaway and Hugh Jackman have been recognised in the lead actor and supporting actress categories in Tom Hooper's big-screen adaptation of Les Miserables. Political thriller Argo has received seven nominations with Ben Affleck in the running for best director and best actor. Other American movies to feature in the shortlist for this year's Bafta awards were Paul Thomas Anderson's The Master which received four nominations, and Zero Dark Thirty with five nominations, including best director for Kathryn Bigelow. Bigelow - who became the first woman to win the Oscar for directing with 2008's The Hurt Locker - said she was ""immensely grateful"" for her latest accolade. ""When you're making a film you have no idea how it will be received, and I can assure you it is overwhelming to receive news like this,"" she added. Silver Linings Playbook garnered nods for Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper in the best actress and best actor categories. The romantic comedy-drama has also been nominated for best adapted screenplay. Dame Helen Mirren has been nominated for best actress for her role as Alfred Hitchcock's wife in Hitchcock. ""This was a wonderful role,"" said Mirren, adding: ""Alma Reville was more than Hitchcock's wife, in many ways she was his muse, his assistant, his editor and more, and I am proud to have had the opportunity to portray her."" Craig misses out There were some notable exclusions in this year's shortlist. While Les Miserables was the only British film to feature in both the best film and best British film categories, its Oscar-winning director, Tom Hooper, missed out on a director's nod while another British Oscar-winner, Sam Mendes, was also left out of the same category for Skyfall. Eric Fellner of Working Title Films, which produced Les Miserables, said Hooper may be upset he was left off the roll for best director ""on a personal level"". ""But on a professional level he'll realise he's made a film that's got nine nominations and as far as we're concerned, the director is the heart and centre of all the films that we make and it's just not possible to get nine nominations without great directorial input."" He added: ""The great news is that yesterday, Tom Hooper got a Directors Guild of America (DGA) nomination, which is really prestigious."" James Bond star Daniel Craig, who was nominated for his role as the suave spy in the film Casino Royale, also missed out in the acting category. Though the film is in the running for best British film, it means the Bond series is still looking for its first ever nomination for best film. Anna Karenina, based on the original Tolstoy novel and directed by Joe Wright, received a total of six nominations, including best British film. It is also in the running for best original music, and best cinematography. There were just three technical nominations for The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. 'Double take' Searching for Sugar Man, the true story of the 1970s rocker Rodriguez is up against The Imposter, about the 1997 case of the French confidence man Frederic Bourdin for best documentary. Also in the category were McCullin, West of Memphis and Marley. Director of The Imposter, Bart Layton, who was nominated for outstanding debut by a British writer, director or producer, said he did a ""double take"" when the nominations were announced. ""I think this is one of the strongest years for documentaries that I can remember across the board, so the fact that we made it into that final group [is amazing]. ""It is a documentary, but it should be up there competing with non-documentaries. The fact it's been acknowledged in that context is testament to that being successful,"" he said. Michael Haneke's Palme d'Or-winner, Amour, about an octogenarian couple coping with illness received four nominations, with Emmanuelle Riva, 85, announced as in the running for best actress and Haneke up for best director. Completing the line up for best director was Quentin Tarantino for Django Unchained, which received a total of five nominations, including best supporting actor for Christoph Waltz.

"The pieces were among a ""small number"" of new works found in the Munich flat by German officials. Experts are now examining the pieces to determine their origin and whether they were looted by Nazis during WW2. The task force investigating the art trove has declined to say how many new works were discovered. Gurlitt, who inherited the priceless collection from his father Hildebrand, an art dealer who traded in works confiscated by the Nazis, died in May. In his will, he left the art haul - more than 1,200 pieces including works by Chagall, Picasso and Matisse - to the Kunstmuseum Bern in Switzerland. The museum has six months to decide whether to accept Gurlitt's bequest. In June, a Matisse painting was the first of the paintings to be confirmed as looted. The task force said the piece belonged to the family of a Parisian art dealer. Hildebrand Gurlitt was ordered by Adolf Hitler to deal in works seized from Jewish families, or which the Nazis considered ""degenerate"". The Matisse was taken from a Jewish art dealer, Paul Rosenberg, in 1941. The task force has said the painting should be returned to Rosenberg's heirs.

"By Mark SavageBBC music reporter The rapper has joined the label's newly-formed 0207 Def Jam imprint, which will champion UK talent. He joins some of the biggest names in rap on the Def Jam roster, from Nas and Q-Tip to Public Enemy and Kanye West. No details were given about the move, beyond a message from parent company Universal Music that hailed him as ""a once in a generation artist"". Stormzy's only album for Atlantic, Heavy Is The Head, reached number one in the UK and was certified platinum last week - representing 300,000 copies sold. It also saw him win his second Brit Award for best male earlier this year.

At the time, the label said the deal covered ""the next chapter for Stormzy the artist, as well as the joint development of an exciting roster of new talent"" via his Merky imprint. However, relations were said to have soured last year after ""offensive"" photographs of Atlantic's boss Ben Cook dressed as a member of Run-DMC circulated online. Tabloid reports claimed Stormzy had played a crucial part in Cook's departure - although the label later denied this was the case, saying: ""No artists were involved in our decision-making.""

In moving to 0207 Def Jam, the rapper follows A&R executive Alec Boateng - aka Twin B - who was instrumental in signing him to Atlantic two years ago.

Between them, the Ghanaian-British twins share a wealth of music industry experience, having worked with the likes of Amy Winehouse, Drake, Dizzee Rascal, Ed Sheeran, Jess Glynne and Rudimental. The launch of the London imprint is part of a global expansion for Def Jam, which is looking beyond the horizons of US hip-hop with ventures in South Africa, Nigeria, Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia, among other countries.

"Allen told The Observer detectives destroyed evidence supporting her case and refused to let her see and keep a photograph of the man harassing her. Alex Gray, 30, from Perth, was convicted of burglary and harassment at Harrow Crown Court earlier in April. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said stalking was taken ""very seriously"". Allen said the long campaign had left her ""a changed person"" and that she had not looked for ""special attention... [only] reassurance and validation"". She said the abuse began in 2009 when Gray set up a Twitter account, @lilyallenRIP, and claimed to have written her number one hit, The Fear. 'I'm not safe' He went on to send letters containing abusive rants, accusations and suicide threats to her flat, her sister's home, her record company and her management, all of which were handed to police. She said police gave her a panic alarm after a banner that read ""I wrote The Fear"" was held up at one of her concerts, but took it back a few months later. She said she was then not given chance to see a picture of Gray, adding that when they eventually did show her an image of him, she was not allowed to keep it. Gray went on to bang on Allen's back door and spend nights in her garden, before breaking into her home in 2015 and ""steaming"" into her bedroom, swearing at her. He was forced from the house by one of Allen's friends, taking a handbag with him. After the handbag was found, Gray was arrested, but Allen said she ""hit a brick wall"" when she tried to raise the issue of stalking, adding that she was told - with ""no apology"" - that the 2009 letters had been ""destroyed 'according to police protocol'"".

"By Helen BushbyBBC entertainment and arts reporter The murder mystery gripped ITV viewers in April, with a peak audience of 8.9 million viewers. The drama about the death of an 11-year-old boy also won critical acclaim. Double Bafta-winner Colman said her return was ""set in stone"" but added she would not be in the US remake. Her Broadchurch co-star David Tennant is reportedly starring in the US version, which is expected to begin filming in January for broadcast on the Fox network during the 2014-2015 season. 'I feel lucky' Colman, who is also currently filming the return of BBC Two comedy Rev, said how ""lucky"" she felt to be doing a wide range of roles. ""I've always enjoyed my work and I'm lucky to be doing it - yes, I feel lucky,"" she said. She won two Baftas in May for her roles in Accused and Twenty Twelve. Colman and Tennant also won best actor and actress for Broadchurch at the Specsavers Crime Thriller Awards in October, while co-star Andrew Buchan was named best supporting actor. The series also took home the award for best TV programme.

"In a court filing on Wednesday, the star's legal team said he had paid more than $1.3m (£1m) in costs and loaned $8m to Jolie to help her buy a house. On Tuesday, Jolie's lawyer said Pitt had paid ""no meaningful child support"" since she filed for divorce in 2016. The couple had been together since 2005 but only married in 2014. In the documents, Pitt's lawyers also said Jolie's claims regarding child support were a ""thinly-veiled effort to manipulate media coverage"". Her lawyer said in the filing on Tuesday: ""[Pitt] has a statutory duty to pay child support. As of present, [he] has paid no meaningful child support since separation. ""Given that the informal arrangements around the payment of the children's expenses have not been regularly sustained... for over a year and a half, [Jolie] intends to file... for the establishment of a retroactive child support order,"" the documents stated. Responding to Pitt's rebuttal, Jolie's lawyer Samantha Bley DeJean said she hoped the dispute could be resolved ""without further delay or posturing"". ""A loan is not... child support and to represent it as such is misleading and inaccurate,"" she said. ""Angelina is asking Brad to pay 50% of the children's expenses. He has not. ""Angelina has had to shoulder the majority of those without his contribution for the past two years. Child support is not optional in California."" Jolie cited ""irreconcilable differences"" when she filed to end the marriage, and the pair became embroiled in a bitter child custody battle in the months following the announcement.

"Amol RajanMedia editor But being an editor isn't just an editorial job. The editorial side of it is the most fulfilling and intellectually stimulating part, but it is only a part. There are also huge commercial responsibilities - how do we make money and save money? - and leadership and management duties. Leadership is about creating a moral vision for where you want to take a team; management is the daily activity of getting them there. It has always seemed to me that in rich newspapers, the editor gets to focus on editing, while other people think about the commercial and managerial side of it. For instance, the Daily Mail has several busy managing editors, whereas the Evening Standard has only one. George Osborne to become Standard editor Osborne Evening Standard job prompts call for inquiry George Osborne: From history buff to austerity editor Read more from Amol At organisations that are strapped for cash - and the Standard is facing big commercial challenges - editors have to spend relatively more of their time thinking about commercial and managerial obligations. And all of that is hugely time consuming. It leaves less time than you would like for the really exciting bit: editing. Truth, integrity and reputation Editing is an exercise in selection and judgement: what to put in and - just as important - what to leave out. Which pictures, campaigns, and above all stories to run? What's the best headline on that front page splash? Shall we give this or that person a kicking in the sports pages? And should our cartoonist really depict Nigel Farage as an amphibian yet again? When making these decisions, based on your judgement, which is in turn informed by your values and experience, an editor has three sacred loyalties - in my view, in no particular order. First, to the truth; second, to the reader; and third, to the integrity and reputation of the newspaper. Some would argue that there are other loyalties. An editor of The Catholic Herald might think they had a duty to God, for instance; an editor of Country Life might feel they had a duty to England's enchanted land; and all editors are likely to feel a duty to those paying the bills. But those earlier loyalties are supreme. They are very different to the loyalties required by political parties. I have never been a member of a political party, but I suspect those who have would say their loyalties aren't primarily to truth, readers, or newspaper reputations. A political party is an institution that organises its members to acquire and exercise legislative power. Its members have loyalty above all to that task. If they are committed, they wake up every day thirsting for power. Once they have acquired it, fidelity to their tribe makes them determined not to relinquish it. Quite aside from the sheer practical workload, it is not easy to see how the loyalties required by editorship and the loyalties required by membership of a political party can be reconciled. The latter long to inhabit the corridors of power. The former want to throw grenades at it. Divided loyalties Journalism, at its best, is about the ferocious scrutiny of power. That requires a certain distance from it. Of course, there are different types of journalism. I can see how it might be feasible for a theatre critic to be group secretary of his local Socialist Workers Party. I can also see how a brilliant football correspondent could be a member of the neo-Nazis. But an editor, who has to conduct daily combat with politicians? In being a member of the Conservative Party and, soon, editor of the London Evening Standard, George Osborne faces both practical and philosophical problems. The practical one is when to sleep. The philosophical one is how to reconcile his clearly divided loyalties. Which of his constituents matter most - those in Tatton, or his near-million readers at the Standard? How does he cover, say, a Budget: as a loyal Conservative MP, or as a fearless editor? It is hard enough to see how you reconcile being a member of a political party with being a journalist, let alone being an editor. However, being not only a member of a political party, but a sitting MP and a recent chancellor, as well as someone who retains political ambitions, is much tougher still. And that's before we even consider BlackRock. How can you cover the world of asset management while being paid £650,000 by it? The idea that Mr Osborne could recuse himself from stories about that industry, or indeed the City pages altogether, strikes me as sub-optimal, to put it mildly: it would be bizarre to have a former chancellor as editor, only for him to have no involvement in business coverage. Full-time job These conflicts of interest are untenable, and so - as I said on Friday - I can't see it lasting. Given his sources of income, he's much likelier to give up being an MP before he gives up having lunch at BlackRock. Whether it happens when Tatton disappears as a constituency, or before, I suspect he will be editor of the London Evening Standard after he is an MP in Cheshire. As I mentioned in my previous posts, his task at the paper - setting out a clear strategy, improving the product, raising its profile, and turning the business around by finding new revenue streams - is one for which he has relevant experience and connections. That said, it strikes me as a full-time job. Perhaps, therefore, Osborne hasn't fully grasped the function of an editor. I hope this post helps.","Editing a newspaper is an extremely rewarding and tough job, probably harder these days than a few decades ago, because of scarcity of resources and the demands of the internet."
"They all turned their Twitter profiles teal blue, to reflect Tidal's branding, on Sunday night. The site launches on Monday, promising CD-quality streaming and thousands of music videos, for a subscription fee. Taylor Swift, who pulled her catalogue off Spotify last November, is among those to feature on the service. Her back catalogue - with the exception of her current album, 1989 - is already available on the service, which requires a monthly subscription of $9,99 (£6.72) for standard-quality music, and $19.99 (£13.47) for the ""high fidelity"" option. A spokesperson for Swift said that the star's back catalogue appears on all streaming services that require a subscription fee. ""This has never been changed. Big Machine Records believes music has value and we do not believe Taylor's music should be made available for free,"" they said. Other artists publically backing Tidal on social media included DJ Calvin Harris, R&B star Usher, country singer Jason Aldean and Beyonce, who is married to Jay Z. It has also been rumoured that Rihanna's much-anticipated eighth album will premiere on the service after Monday's launch event. The R&B singer is signed to Jay Z's Roc Nation label, making such a deal possible, but there has been no official confirmation. Jay Z's company Project Panther bought Aspiro, a Swedish tech firm that runs two streaming music services (WiMP and Tidal) for $56 million (£37.7m) on 13 March. According to Forbes, the rapper intends to allow artists who sign up to his site reap more rewards than they would on rivals such as Spotify, Rdio, Rhapsody and Beats Music. He will announce his plans at a live-streamed launch event at 22:00 GMT in New York. A press invitation for the event promised that ""Shawn 'Jay Z' Carter and special guests will announce a commitment to a new direction for the music industry from both a creative and business perspective"". The launch comes as the streaming market becomes increasingly competitive. The rapid success of Spotify, which now has more than 15 million paid subscribers and 60 million total users, has prompted many tech companies to launch similar services. Last year, Google announced a subscription service that allows users to stream ad-free music videos, and download them for offline use. The monthly fee for Music Key also provides membership to Google Play All Access, the firm's pre-existing ""all-you-can-eat"" music facility.

"By Mark SavageBBC music reporter The call took place in 2016, as West sought Swift's permission to mention her name in his song Famous. When the track was eventually released, she objected to a lyric which referred to her as a ""bitch""; but West's wife, Kim Kardashian posted an edited version of the call, saying Swift had approved. The leak, however, seems to show that West omitted the offensive word. The two musicians have had a stormy relationship since 2009, when West interrupted Swift's acceptance speech for best female video at the MTV Music Awards. Grabbing her microphone, West objected to the award, saying Beyonce's Single Ladies video deserved the prize more than Swift's You Belong With Me. ""Taylor Swift, I'mma let you finish,"" he said, in a clip that's become one of music's most recognisable memes, ""but Beyoncé had one of the best videos of all time!"" Their relationship had thawed in the mid-2010s - but the release of Famous prompted a major falling out, with Swift taking particular exception to West's lyric, ""I made that bitch famous"". Kardashian leapt to her husband's defence, telling GQ Magazine that Swift ""totally approved"" the line. ""She totally knew that that was coming out. She wanted to all of a sudden act like she didn't. I swear, my husband gets so much [criticism] for things [when] he really was doing proper protocol and even called to get it approved."" Kardashian later released an edited version of that phone call, triggering a wave of hatred and vitriol towards Swift, whose social media feeds were bombarded with ""snake"" emojis from people who felt she'd been duplicitous. Swift responded with a statement saying the video didn't tell the full story. ""Where is the video of Kanye telling me he was going to call me 'that bitch' in his song? It doesn't exist because it never happened. ""You don't get to control someone's emotional response to being called 'that bitch' in front of the entire world. ""While I wanted to be supportive of Kanye on the phone call, you cannot approve a song you've never heard. ""Being falsely painted as a liar when I was never given the full story or played any part of the song is character assassination."" The situation got worse when West placed a nude waxwork of Swift in the song's video. She discussed the repercussions at length in her subsequent album, Reputation, and made the snake emoji a recurring motif of her 2018 world tour. 'The feminists are going to come out' Then, over the weekend, a full 23-minute video of the West-Swift phone call appeared online, and appeared to vindicate Swift's account. The rapper first describes the lyric ""I feel like me and Taylor Swift might still have sex"", eliciting laughter from Swift, who acknowledges the line is tongue-in-cheek. ""I'm glad it's not mean,"" she says. ""I definitely think that when I'm asked about it, of course I'll be like, 'Yeah, I love that. I think it's hilarious.' But, um, I need to think about it. A large part of the conversation then focuses on an alternative version of the lyric - ""Taylor Swift might owe me sex"" - which Swift argues against. If West releases that version, she says, ""the feminists are going to come out"". Later, West cautiously raises the second, more contentious line. ""Okay, now what if later in the song I was also to have said, uh… 'I made her famous?'"" he asks. Swift's tone notably changes as she responds; and points out to West that she had sold millions of albums by the time he interrupted her at the MTV Awards. ""But I mean, you've got to tell the story the way that it happened to you and the way that you've experienced it,"" she adds. ""Like, you honestly didn't know who I was before that. Like, it doesn't matter if I sold 7 million of that album [Fearless] before you did that, which is what happened. You didn't know who I was before that. It's fine."" Although the clips that have surfaced online are incomplete and fragmented, they seem to suggest that West never raised the idea of calling Swift ""that bitch"" in his song. And Swift stops short of giving her full approval to the song. ""I need to think about it, because you know, when you hear something for the first time, you just need to think about it. Because it is absolutely crazy."" She also expresses relief that the language wasn't overly offensive. ""I thought it was going to be like, 'That stupid, dumb bitch'. But it's not,"" says the star. In response, West promises to send her the song and ""the exact wording and everything about it,"" but Swift's camp has always maintained the rapper never kept that commitment. It is unclear how the footage made its way online, but it seems to have done little to persuade die-hard fans of who was in the right: Swift's fans say she has been vindicated, while West's maintain her approval of the song was implicit. Neither side has commented, but both Swift and Kardashian reacted to posts by fans who were fighting their corner. Kardashian liked a tweet from a fan who wrote, ""The video showed nothing new. We all knew that. I'm so confused right now"". Swift, meanwhile, liked several posts on her official Tumblr account, including one that said: ""Who was telling the truth the whole time?"" next to a photo of the singer pointing to herself. ""And that is how you let Karma take care of itself,"" another fan wrote, referring to the rumoured title of her next album. Swift's camp has always contended that West never followed up on his repeated vows to send her the entire song, with or without the ""that bitch"" line.

"The CBBC children's sketch show featured a segment in which Nightingale explained to Jamaican-born Mary Seacole that her nursing corps was only ""for British girls"". Seacole replied her father was from Scotland. The trust said the ""overall impression"" was that Nightingale had acted ""in a racially discriminatory manner"". Nightingale, regarded as the founder of modern nursing, came to prominence while serving as a nurse during the Crimean War from 1853-1856, where she tended to wounded soldiers. She was nicknamed The Lady with the Lamp. Seacole provided care for wounded servicemen on the battlefield and was posthumously awarded the Jamaican Order of Merit in 1991. In the sketch, originally broadcast in 2010, the Seacole character, speaking with a thick Jamaican accent, said: ""Four times me tried to join Old Lamp-Face's nurses in the Crimean War, and four times she said no."" The actress playing Nightingale responded disdainfully: ""The nursing corps was for British girls. You're from Jamaica."" The trusts editorial standards committee ruled the sketch breached editorial guidelines on accuracy adding the programme's makers should have done more to make it clear that it was not Nightingale herself who rejected Seacole. Viewers would ""be likely to regard the implied allegation of racial discrimination as established historical fact"", the committee said. It said: ""Given the seriousness of any imputation of racism, the relative recency of Nightingale's life...the immensity of Nightingale's contribution to modern nursing and her significant stature in modern British history, the committee felt it was incumbent on the programme makers to ensure that there was sound evidence upon which to base any suggestion that she had acted in a racially discriminatory manner.""

All you have to do is readjust your mind-set to a time when a ridiculously plummy accent was a sign of status, and not an affectation routinely adopted by estate agents in the Cotswolds. Even then, there are instances when the cut-glass voices become - as the Queen might say - simplee too much. One such scene sees Harold Macmillan (Anton Lesser) having a man-to-man chat over a game of snooker with naughty John Profumo. It should feel terribly serious; the government's very reputation is at stake. But instead of being drawn into the thickening dramatic plot, you find yourself behaving like Macmillan's unfaithful wife and laughing at him. Not for being rubbish in bed, or whatever gripe she had, but because he sounds exactly like the spoof 1930s newsreader, Mr Cholmondley-Warner, from Harry Enfield's 1990s TV series. Which is not to say the show is without its own intentional humour. There are plenty of gags usually deployed in the form of a crisp line from Prince Philip to his self-possessed missus. Both characters are portrayed largely sympathetically, although the real Duke of Edinburgh might have a few choice words of his own to say about the show's focus on his libido rather than his intellect, not to mention how it speculates and implicates him in the notorious Profumo affair. Claire Foy returns to give us a reprise of her Queen, and once again she nails the role. There are moments when you think she's going to blow it; you can see her teetering on the edge, pushing it to the point of no return where you fear she's going to allow something appallingly hammy or horribly trite to undermine her character, but every time she pulls back from the brink and delivers a perfectly-timed comment or expression. She is a fine actress. And Matt Smith is an excellent foil as the philandering Philip. They're a decent double act. As are Vanessa Kirby's Princess Margaret and Matthew Goode's Antony Armstrong-Jones, who own Episode 4, and make it the stand out show of the series. Among the hits, there are one or two misses. Episode nine is weaker than most. It focuses on the education of Prince Charles and his father's decision to send him to the harsh environs of Gordonstoun School in the north of Scotland instead of the perfectly nice local school, Eton. We're taken back to young Philip's early days, get an eyeful of some Nazi sympathising relatives, and see the boy turn into the man he would become. Quite how the crack team behind the show managed to turn such rich dramatic potential into a slightly dull hour of telly is as bewildering as the miscasting of Victoria Hamilton as the Queen Mother. There's nothing wrong with Hamilton as an actress, but the way in which she has been asked to play this role doesn't strike true and adds nothing when, even with a touch of nuance, so much more could have been said. But these are small gripes. Overall, The Crown is a first-class piece of television, which is beautifully shot and boasts many fine performances. Peter Morgan's well-crafted scripts allow our imaginations to conceive the unknowable - how the Queen reacted to events from the Suez Crisis to the assassination of President Kennedy, and what effect her actions may have had on the world today. There's no doubt she has had a big impact on Morgan's life. This is the third time he has written about the present-day monarch (The Crown was preceded by his Oscar-winning film, The Queen, and Olivier-winning play, The Audience). In fact, he has done so well out of writing about her life it is probably about time he offered her a royalty payment.","The Crown is back. The second season of the royal drama, which is released on Netflix next weekend, consists of 10 one-hour episodes covering Queen Elizabeth II's life between 1956 and 1963."
"By Helen BushbyEntertainment and arts reporter The ceremony, filmed at several outdoor New York locations with a limited audience, was dedicated to the late Black Panther star Chadwick Boseman. It included pre-recorded speeches and performances, with Lady Gaga saying: ""Love who you are. Be kind. Mask up."" Host Keke Palmer called Boseman, who died on Friday, ""a true hero"". Here are some key moments from the socially-distanced show, which was broadcast on Sunday night, with the full list of winners here. 1. Lady Gaga on 'wrath' and 'rage' of art Gaga's wins were for best artist, song, collaboration and cinematography, plus the first MTV Tricon Award - honouring her work in music, acting and fashion. ""This has not been an easy year for a lot of people, but what I see in the world is a massive triumph of courage,"" she said. ""Just because we're separated right now and culture may feel less alive in some ways, I know a renaissance is coming, and the wrath of pop culture will inspire you and the rage of art will empower you as it responds to hardship with its generosity and love. "" Model Bella Hadid, who called Gaga a ""powerhouse"" as she introduced her, said: ""She turns pop music into high art. She redefines fashion.. she inspires and empowers all of us."" 2. MTV remembers Chadwick Boseman Host Keke Palmer said of Chadwick Boseman: ""We dedicate tonight's show to a man whose spirit touched so many. He's a true hero, not just on screen but in everything he did. His impact lives forever."" The awards honoured the late actor, who died of colon cancer aged just 43, with a throwback to his 2018 appearance at the MTV Movie Awards, when he won best hero and best performance in a film for playing T'Challa in Black Panther. During his speech, he invited James Shaw Jr to the stage to thank him for protecting other restaurant-goers from a gunman who opened fire in a waffle house in Tennessee. He gave Shaw his popcorn trophy and said: ""This is gonna live at your house. God bless you, man."" The clip of Boseman ended with the words ""rest in power"". 3. The Weeknd called for justice over shootings The Weeknd won the highly prized video of the year award for Blinding Lights, using his speech to demand justice in the cases of two African Americans shot by police. ""It's hard to celebrate, so I'm just going to say justice for Jacob Blake and justice for Breonna Taylor,"" he said. Da Baby's performance echoed this, referencing the ongoing protests against police violence, and singing his song Blind while handcuffed from the back of a police car. Palmer's opening monologue also referenced the social unrest sparked by the death of George Floyd in May. ""We can never tolerate police brutality,"" she said. ""It's our time to be the change we want to see. We need to come together, and music has that power."" Although The Weeknd looked like he'd been beaten up, he wore make-up which replicated his look for his winning video, in which he ends up with injuries to his face. 4. Taylor Swift makes history Taylor Swift was the first solo female artist to win best directing for her video The Man, and was only the second woman to win the award, following Melina Matsoukas for Formation by Beyonce in 2016. The video takes aim at male music executives - in particular Scooter Braun, who purchased her back catalogue last year, and the credits stress the video was directed, produced and owned by Swift. ""I was told that this was an industry-voted award. So I want to say thank you to everyone in the industry who voted for this video,"" she said. ""But I also really want to thank the fans because you are the only reason why the industry cares about anything that I do."" 5. Ariana Grande appeared just once The singer won three awards for her collaboration with Lady Gaga plus one for best music video from home for Stuck on U with Justin Bieber. But she made just a single appearance on stage, for a masked performance with Gaga. She tweeted her thanks to her for their win for song of the year, for Rain on Me. Calling Gaga ""the most gracious and stunning"", she added she was ""so grateful to be a part of this"". 6. BTS's Dynamite gets live TV debut The South Korean pop band won for pop video, group, K-pop and choreography and this was their first appearance at the awards, which will have delighted their legions of fans. They performed English-language song Dynamite remotely from Seoul, dancing in front of backdrops of New York. Their suited and booted performance ended with a display of fireworks which appeared behind them, matching their lyrics: ""So I'm-a light it up like dynamite."" 7. And not forgetting the best quarantine performance... The awards acknowledged the many performances from artists during the coronavirus pandemic, for their creativity in remaining connected with their fans during lockdown. The prize went to Latino boy band CNCO - Unplugged At Home, who beat Chloe x Halle, DJ D-Nice, John Legend, Lady Gaga and Post Malone. Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

"The 71-year-old Oscar winner wrote on Twitter: ""Well... I'm in Momma Mia 2."" It's not known what role she will play. The singer is currently in the UK, where filming is taking place for the follow-up to the Abba musical, set for release next summer. Many of the characters from the original film, including Meryl Streep, Pierce Brosnan and Dame Julie Walters, will also appear in the sequel. Cher would not be drawn on the name of her character or what songs she would be singing, but did tweet song title Fernando - followed by a thinking emoji. Cher also confirmed she had been rehearsing dance routines, tweeting: ""Just went through two dance numbers, everyone's great."" It will be the singer's first appearance in a film since 2010. She has previously starred in films including Mermaids, The Witches of Eastwick and Moonstruck - for which she won a best actress Oscar in 1988. Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again! is currently being filmed both in the UK and on location in Croatia. It will include Abba songs not featured in the 2008 film. The plot of the film is yet to be revealed, but it's set to feature flashbacks as Lily James has joined the cast to play a younger version of Donna, portrayed by Streep in the original. The BBC understands the film will focus on the relationships between the characters played by Streep, Brosnan and Colin Firth in their youth. If so, Cher - whose hits include If I Could Turn Back Time and You Better Sit Down Kids - is sure to be a valuable addition. The first Mamma Mia! movie is the highest-grossing film musical of all time, taking more than £450m worldwide. The soundtrack of the movie has been certified platinum in more than 20 countries.

"Plans for a follow-up to the hit 1986 film were announced last year, but it was not known if and how much the star would be involved. Speaking to MTV, Cruise said he was in talks with director Tony Scott and would go ahead provided they could ""find a story that we all want to do"". ""I hope we can figure this out to do it again,"" he said. Scott directed Cruise in the first Top Gun film, which propelled him to fame as fighter pilot Maverick. The Jerry Bruckheimer-produced film, which also starred Kelly McGillis and Val Kilmer, was nominated for four Oscars and won the best song Academy Award for Take My Breath Away. Cruise said: ""I said to Tony, I want to make another movie with him. He and I haven't made a film since Days Of Thunder."" ""Tony and I and Jerry, we never thought that we would do it again. Then they started to come to us with these ideas and I thought, wow, that would be what we could do now. ""We all want to make a film that is in the same kind of tone as the other one and shoot it in the same way as we shot Top Gun,"" he added. It had been rumoured that Cruise's character would return in the sequel as an instructor for a new class of Top Gun recruits. But when asked what his role would be in a new film, the actor said: ""I don't know - we're working on it."" Cruise will next be seen on screen in a fourth Mission: Impossible film, Ghost Protocol.",Mission: Impossible star Tom Cruise has confirmed he is involved in the forthcoming Top Gun sequel.
"It has attracted attention for its explicit sex scenes as well as the acclaimed performances of actresses Adele Exarchopoulos and Lea Seydoux. Hollywood veteran Bruce Dern won best actor for his performance in Nebraska. And French star Berenice Bejo, known for silent film The Artist, won best actress for her role in The Past. The winners were picked from the 20 films in competition and were named at the festival's closing ceremony on Sunday. Blue is the Warmest Colour is a three-hour coming-of-age movie in which Exarchopoulos plays a 15-year-old who falls in love with an older woman, played by Seydoux. Directed by Abdellatif Kechiche, it won rave reviews in Cannes, being described as ""epic yet intimate"" by The Guardian. But it also shocked some critics. Variety magazine said it contained ""the most explosively graphic lesbian sex scenes in recent memory"". The Hollywood Reporter said the ""sprawling drama"" would ""raise eyebrows"" as it crossed the barrier ""between performance and the real deal"". Some had questioned whether the sex scenes may make it too explicit for the top prize. But director Steven Spielberg, who chaired the jury, told reporters: ""I think it will get a lot of play... I think this film carries a very strong message, a very positive message."" In an unusual move, Spielberg awarded the prize to the two lead actresses as well as the director. Accepting the prize, Abdellatif Kechiche said: ""I should like to dedicate this film to the wonderful youth of France whom I met during the long period while making this film. ""Those young people taught me a lot about the spirit of freedom and living together."" Blue is the Warmest Colour prevented US film-makers the Coen brothers from repeating their Palme d'Or success of 1991, when they won for Barton Fink. Their latest film Inside Llewyn Davis, about the 1960s New York folk scene, won this year's Grand Prix, effectively the runners-up prize. The best actor award marks a return to the critical bosom for Bruce Dern, who is best known for roles in 1970s films including Coming Home, The Cowboys and The Great Gatsby. Now 76, he has won for playing an ageing, alcoholic father on a road trip to collect a lottery prize. The film, titled Nebraska, was directed by Sideways and The Descendants film-maker Alexander Payne. Berenice Bejo's best actress prize has proved that her performance in The Artist was not a one-off. Her film The Past is a family drama made by Iranian director Asghar Farhadi as the follow-up to his Oscar-nominated 2011 drama A Separation. Mexico's Amat Escalante, who made brutal drama Heli about the country's drugs war, was something of a surprise choice for best director. China's Jia Zhangke won best screenplay for A Touch of Sin, an examination of rampant corruption in his country. The Jury Prize went to Like Father, Like Son, about two families who discover that their six-year-old boys were switched at birth, directed by Japan's Hirokazu Kore-eda. Films that missed out included Behind the Candelabra, in which Michael Douglas plays the legendarily flamboyant entertainer Liberace, and Italian director Paolo Sorrentino's The Great Beauty, a sumptuous story about an ageing novelist. Spielberg was joined on the jury by Life of Pi director Ang Lee, actress Nicole Kidman and Oscar-winner Christoph Waltz. The other judges were We Need To Talk About Kevin film-maker Lynne Ramsay, French actor Daniel Auteuil, Romanian director Cristian Mungiu, Japanese director Naomi Kawase and Bollywood star Vidya Balan.","Blue is the Warmest Colour, an intimate love story about two young French women, has won the Palme d'Or for best film at the Cannes Film Festival."
"Foreign Office funding for the service will stop in April 2014 when it will be paid for out of the licence fee. The Foreign Affairs Committee said the World Service could not ""plan properly"" because the BBC had yet to issue an operating licence to define its budget. The BBC Trust said it had shared a draft licence with the service. A World Service spokesman said the change in funding next April, when it will be integrated with the BBC's domestic news services, ""provides certainty and stability"". But the committee of MPs said it did not see how the World Service could prepare when it would not know ""either the priorities, targets or characteristics which have been set for it, or its budget"" until a few months before the change came into force. ""We do not see how the BBC World Service can plan properly how to reflect its new priorities, pursue its new objectives or shape its output... given the short lead-in time,"" the report said. 'Direct conflict' The BBC Trust said in a statement: ""We are in regular, ongoing discussions with the World Service about the transition to licence fee funding from 2014 to ensure that this transition is as smooth as possible, and we are already delivering on a number of the committee's recommendations."" It said it had ""already consulted the World Service on the draft operating licence"" and would publish the draft for wider public consultation in the summer ""as has always been our intention"". There had been regular discussions with the World Service about the draft since February, it added. The committee has also called for ""some form of direct representation"" from the World Service on the BBC's executive board, instead of by the director of news. The report said World Service interests would be ""in direct conflict"" with those of other departments. In October, the World Service announced it was to lose a further 73 jobs as part of the latest round of cutbacks to save £42m, with 25 jobs going in the English-language service. Savings of £30m have already been made following its reduction in funding by the government in 2010. The committee also warned that, while it was logical to withdraw shortwave radio in dwindling markets where audiences had access to the internet and TV, such services still had a place. ""The World Service must continue to take into account significant audiences in certain parts of the world, such as rural India and Africa, who currently rely on shortwave radio,"" it added. The committee's report, which also covers the work of the Foreign Office and the British Council, also warns that the UK risks losing credibility if more senior diplomats are not fluent in a range of languages.","Uncertainty about the BBC World Service budget as the corporation prepares to take on full funding of the service is ""unacceptable"", MPs have warned."
"The 24-year-old SNL comedian jokingly asked if there was ""anybody looking for a roommate?"" at a benefit gig. He was doing stand-up alongside Judd Apatow at a benefit gig for the Democrats in LA. This is the first time Davidson has publicly acknowledged his split from the singer. The pair first got together in May and became engaged shortly after. They moved into 25-year-old Ariana's apartment in New York and spent most of the summer together, but it was not meant to be. US sources reported last week that the pair had agreed ""it was not the right time for their relationship to take off"". Davidson's stand up set followed on from Judd Apatow at the event, joking ""who wants to follow that?"". He added: ""Am I not going through enough that I have to follow that?!"" He then made some more jokes about the break up, commenting: ""Well, as you can tell, I don't want to be here. There's a lot going on. Anybody have any open rooms? Anybody looking for a roommate?"" Whilst Davidson didn't address what had happened to Ariana's engagement ring or the pair's pet pig, Piggie Smalls, he did joke about all the tattoos he got during his five month relationship. ""I've been covering a bunch of tattoos, that's fun. I'm 0-for-2 in the tattoo department,"" he joked. ""Yeah, I'm afraid to get my mom tattooed on me because she'd leave"".

"By Torin DouglasMedia correspondent It's the programmes, stupid! The BBC now talks about content rather than programmes, because it produces so much for its website - but you get the idea. Ultimately, the BBC - and its director general - will be judged on the output, and how much audiences have enjoyed it. This can be measured in many ways - ratings, awards, reviews, appreciation surveys. But in the end it comes down to a handful of great programmes and/or services which the BBC can point to with pride and say ""we did that"". Serious or showbiz? That ""handful"" will vary from household to household. Fans of Sherlock, Strictly Come Dancing, Top Gear or Wonders of the Solar System may or may not like all of these programmes. They may not all be listeners of the Proms on Radio 3, Radio 4's Today programme, 6 Music or users of the BBC News website, which others can't live without. Some will hate output - and presenters - that others will adore. As the ""serious or showbiz"" row over the coverage of the Queen's Jubilee Pageant showed, you can't please all people all of the time. The creative challenge for the director general is to steer a clear course for the corporation, encompassing the breadth of output while keeping standards high. Balancing the books The licence fee has been frozen until 2016 and the BBC has been given new things to pay for, including the BBC World Service. Cuts of 20% have been announced - and approved by the BBC Trust - on top of substantial savings already made in previous years. They will not be easy to achieve. Plans to close Radio 6 Music and the Asian Network were overturned after the BBC Trust's intervention and no services are now due to close. But keeping quality high when so many jobs are being lost will not be easy. Will the next director general review those decisions? The next BBC Charter and licence fee settlement The BBC was set up by a Royal Charter and Agreement, as distinct from an Act of Parliament, to emphasise its independence from the government. Even so, it's the government of the day that negotiates the terms with the BBC. The current Charter also runs until the end of 2016, so negotiations over the future size and scope of the corporation will begin before then. At the same time, the next licence fee deal will be thrashed out - a major challenge for the director general. The next 'big thing' The world of communications is changing more rapidly than ever and the BBC now competes with broadcasters and technology companies all over the world. The director general, consulting with the BBC Trust, must steer the corporation through the digital maze, and make big decisions about where to invest large sums of its money. Previous directors general have led the BBC from radio into television, to the internet, digital terrestrial TV, high-definition TV and the iPlayer. Making the crucial technological moves over the next five years will be harder than ever. How global and how commercial? The BBC is a worldwide player in news and entertainment. BBC World Service and the BBC World News TV channel have global followings. Strictly Come Dancing (Dancing With the Stars, as it's called in the US and other parts of the world) has become the world's most successful TV format. Top Gear and Doctor Who are also international brands. But there is a tricky tension between the BBC's public-service funding (which is being squeezed) and its commercial demands and aspirations (which are growing). The director general must lead the corporation through this too. Top BBC pay The amount the BBC pays its top management and on-air performers has been highly controversial, damaging the corporation's reputation. BBC chairman Lord Patten has said it's a ""toxic"" issue which is being tackled, and the new director general will be paid less than the current one. But the BBC still competes for talent with commercial broadcasters and technology companies across the world. It's not an issue that will go away. The unexpected The BBC's programmes and website are paid for by every household in the country and are available all over the world. They compete not just with broadcasters such as ITV and BSkyB, but newspapers across the political spectrum. The director general must expect rows with the government and complaints from everywhere - listeners and viewers, political pressure groups, commercial rivals and the press. A previous director general, Greg Dyke - who lost his job after a row with the government - said the biggest rows usually broke when he was on holiday. So the biggest challenge may simply be - expect the unexpected.","George Entwistle has been announced as the new BBC director general, replacing the outgoing Mark Thompson. What are the challenges the newcomer is likely to face?"
"""While the BBC remains the most used media brand in the UK, its share of younger audiences has been under pressure,"" the spending watchdog said. ""Falling audience share poses a financial risk as people are less likely to pay the licence fee."" The BBC said it had already set out plans for ""urgent"" reforms. According to the NAO report, the BBC has seen ""a notable drop"" in audience viewing while its income from the licence fee has also declined. The BBC ""faces considerable uncertainty"" about its licence fee income and should produce ""a long-term financial plan... as soon as possible"", it states. Such a plan, the report recommends, should ""set out the detail for the next stage of its savings, and how it will fund its new strategic priorities"". In 2019-20, the BBC generated total income of £4.94bn, of which £3.52bn was public funding from the licence fee. That was £310m less than the corporation received from the licence fee between 2017-18. The report also highlighted a 30% decline in BBC TV viewing over the past decade. On average, the amount of time an adult spent watching broadcast BBC television fell from 80 minutes a day in 2010 to 56 minutes in 2019. And the NAO said the BBC's financial health had been ""unexpectedly weakened"" by the impact of the coronavirus response. Last November, the BBC began negotiations with the government about the future funding it will receive from the licence fee. The fee, which is currently £157.50 annually, is due to stay in place until at least 2027, when the BBC's Royal Charter ends. 'Significant savings' In response, the BBC said it had made ""significant savings and increased efficiencies, while maintaining our spending on content, and continuing to be the UK's most-used media organisation"". It added: ""We have set out plans for urgent reforms focused on providing great value for all audiences and we will set out further detail on this in the coming months. ""The report also stresses the importance of stable funding for the future, which we welcome as we begin negotiations with government over the licence fee."" The National Union of Journalists said the report's findings ""come as no surprise"" and that the BBC needs ""a financially secure long-term deal that will guarantee its future."" The NAO scrutinises the finances of government departments and other public sector bodies. Last week Richard Sharp, the BBC's incoming chairman, said the licence fee was the ""least worst"" way of funding the corporation, but it ""may be worth reassessing"" in future.

Performances by her long-term collaborators, such as dancers and drummers, will take place in the fog. The first BMW Tate Live exhibition, to be an annual event, opens in spring. Live installations will be created in and above the Tate Modern's underground Tanks space, which the gallery said will ""provide visitors with a distinctive location in which to engage with new art in a new way"". 'Primary experience' Nakaya, 83, has been working on a system of dispersing water vapour to create mist since the 1970s. Her father has been credited with making the first artificial snowflakes. She said: ""Walking inside fog, people are suddenly confronted with white darkness, but soon they find themselves trying to use all the senses other than the visual to orient themselves. ""People love the feel of fog on their skin, immersed, wet and cold, but gentle and soothing. It's a primary experience."" Her previous installations include those at Frank Gehry's Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao and the Grand Palais in Paris. Other works being staged as part of Ten Days Six Nights include a plant-filled room in which artist Isabel Lewis will be ""combining music, food, drink and scent to create an alternative environment for dance, discussions and invited musicians"", said the Tate. Its director of exhibitions Achim Borchardt-Hume said: ""Our culture is always changing, and so exhibitions must change too.

"The play, written by Doctor Foster writer Mike Bartlett, is being adapted into a one-off drama for BBC Two. The Olivier Award-winning play imagines Prince Charles's accession to the throne following the Queen's death. Tim Pigott-Smith, who played King Charles on stage, is reprising the role for TV. Charlotte Riley, who has also appeared in the mini-series Close to the Enemy and the film London Has Fallen, said she was ""really excited"" to take on the ""challenge"" of playing Kate Middleton. She said: ""It's such a unique project. To be both modern and rich in verse and to play someone who is real but yet totally re-imagined for this story is an exciting prospect for an actor. ""Kate Middleton is a really interesting woman, particularly within the context of this play, and it is a challenge I am really looking forward to."" Constitutional crisis In the play, King Charles refuses to sign a controversial bill into law, leading to political chaos, a constitutional crisis and rioting in the streets. Pigott-Smith said it was important that the play, which also transferred to Broadway, was filmed. ""It is a drama about us, now, who we are, and the relevance of our monarchy,"" he said. ""Television gives it an important democratic voice."" Other cast members from the stage version also starring in the adaptation are Oliver Chris as William, Richard Goulding as Harry and Margot Leicester as Camilla. Bartlett said the production was now fully cast and is about to begin shooting.

"Winter's Annabel joins other debut novels, The Tiger's Wife by Tea Obrecht and Grace Williams Says It Loud by Emma Henderson, on the list. Emma Donoghue's Room, Aminatta Forna's The Memory of Love and Great House by Nicole Krauss are also contenders. The £30,000 prize is open to books written in English by women. Broadcaster Bettany Hughes, chair of the judging panel, said the number of first-time novelists on the list was ""an indicator of the rude health of women's writing"". ""The verve and scope of storylines pays compliment to the female imagination,"" she added. This year's winner will be announced at the Royal Festival Hall in London on 8 June. Annabel tells the story of a hermaphrodite raised as a boy in a remote part of north-east Canada whose secret threatens to emerge. Winter, who was born in Gateshead before moving to Canada, began her career writing songs and scripts for Sesame Street. Previous winners Donoghue's novel Room - told from the point of view of a five-year-old boy locked in a room with his mother - was shortlisted for last year's Booker Prize. The Irish-born author now lives in Ontario, Canada. The UK is represented on the list by Londoners Forna and Henderson. The Memory of Love tells the tale of a psychologist who leaves England for Sierra Leone, where he strikes up friendships with a young surgeon and an elderly patient. In Grace Williams Says It Loud, former English teacher Henderson tells of an 11-year-old girl in a mental institution who befriends a boy with epilepsy. In Great House, New Yorker Krauss writes a series of stories connecting a Chilean poet, an Israeli antiques dealer and a man caring for his dying wife. The final nominee, The Tiger's Wife, follows a young doctor who, upon hearing of her grandfather's death, goes on a journey inspired by his stories.

"The study commissioned by the professional association Directors UK showed that the percentage of UK films directed exclusively by women has barely changed in 10 years. The percentage has risen from 11.3% in 2005 to 11.9% in 2014. Suffragette director Sarah Gavron, called the figures ""shocking and startling"". ""Film, of course, influences our culture, which is why it is vital to have diversity and more gender equality both in front of and behind the camera,"" she said. ""We need to work to shift this imbalance, and it seems the only way to do this is to be radical, rather than waiting for something to change."" The society is calling for half of all publicly-funded films to be directed by women by 2020. They are calling for films to meet diversity criteria, which would include gender factors, before they receive government funding. They say their suggestion of a 50:50 split in public funding is something that has been achieved in other countries, such as Sweden. Beryl Richards, chairwoman of Directors UK, said it was unacceptable that ""this level of inequality continues to go unchecked - not least the film industry that plays such an influential role in our economy, our society and our culture"". ""With such comprehensive evidence we can now pinpoint and address the areas that need the most attention and focus on rectifying it."" She said part of the blame must be in part a lack of a regulatory system to enforce gender equality. The report claimed a vicious cycle exists in the industry in which new female talent is discouraged by a lack of role models, which in turn leads to a smaller pool of next generation female directors. Figures show that while 50.1% of film students and 49.4% of new entrants to the industry are women, just 21.7% of publicly funded films had a female director in 2014 - a figure that has dropped from 32.9% in 2008. In January a study showed that just 9% of Hollywood's highest grossing films last year were directed by women, the same level as 1998. Last October, it was reported that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in the US had begun contacting female directors to investigate gender discrimination in Hollywood.","Only 13.6% of film directors working in the UK are women, according to a new report."
"The previous best opening weekend was Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2, which opened in July 2011 with $169m (£104m). The Disney film was called Marvel Avengers Assemble for its UK release. Included in the top five of biggest openers are The Dark Knight and Spider-Man 3. The Dark Knight, starring Christian Bale as the Caped Crusader, took $158m (£97m) in its opening weekend in 2008, while Spider-Man 3 took $151m (£93m). Both superheroes will once again be seen on screen during the summer. The Avengers, directed by Joss Whedon, failed to beat the final Harry Potter's first day takings record of $91m (£56m) but surpassed it over the following two days.

"Dan Harmon, who also co-created animated series Rick and Morty, said he had wanted ""to parody the series Dexter and only succeeded in offending"". He said in a statement: ""Nobody should ever have to see what you saw and for that, I sincerely apologise."" Adult Swim, which airs Rick and Morty, said Harmon had shown ""poor judgement"". Its statement continued: ""Dan recognised his mistake at the time and has apologised. ""He understands there is no place for this type of content here at Adult Swim."" In the video, intended as the pilot for a series called Daryl, Harmon is seen breaking into a house and simulating rape on an infant doll. ""I quickly realised the content was way too distasteful and took the video down immediately,"" he said. The 43-year-old writer and producer is best known for Community, a sitcom set in a community college, which ran from 2009 to 2015. Production of the sitcom was marked by a public feud between Harmon and actor Chevy Chase, who left the show in 2012. Rick and Morty, which first aired in 2013, is an anarchic animated sitcom that follows the adventures of a mad scientist and his grandson. The show has been a big hit on Adult Swim, Cartoon Network's night-time haven for alternative and adult-oriented animation.

"By Mark SavageBBC music reporter For most of the conversation they're on an equal footing, whether reminiscing about their childhood or duelling over the vocals on Superstition. But then Sir Tom brings up Wonder's writing. ""It's great you can express yourself but I'm not a songwriter,"" he confesses. ""I can't do that. I have to sing songs that are already there."" The moment is laden with pathos. Sir Tom is both in awe of Wonder's work, and humbled by his own inability. But then Wonder retorts that Sir Tom is a ""songwriter's dream"" - someone who can inhabit a lyric, regardless of whether they wrote it. It's why his recording of The Green, Green Grass of Home remains better known than Porter Wagoner's original; and why his version of She's A Lady eclipsed that of its writer, Paul Anka. Twenty-eight years later, and the Welsh baritone acknowledges the truth of Wonder's reply. It's something he's leant into on his last three albums - which have found him singing gospel, country and folk standards, while shedding the ostentatious showboating of his 60s output. On his latest record, Surrounded By Time, Sir Tom is once again re-interpreting some old favourites - from weather-worn ballads like The Windmills Of Your Mind, which won the Oscar for Best Song in 1969; to more obscure choices, like Terry Callier's nine-minute tale of rebirth and redemption, Lazarus Man. It's a particularly personal album - the first one he's recorded in Wales, and the first since the death of his beloved wife Linda. The songs he's chosen are suitably reflective and intimate, with producer Ethan Johns stretching the icon's vocals over brooding electronics, and swirling psychedelic rock. But whatever you do, don't call it a covers project. ""The word cover is widely used and it's not true, because it's my version of other people's songs,"" says the 80-year-old. ""You couldn't say to Sir Laurence Olivier that he's 'covering' Macbeth. It's his take on it. And if you hear somebody else do Macbeth, you know it's not going to be the same. That's the way I feel about songs."" Surrounded By Time opens with the slow and mournful I Won't Crumble With You If You Fall. Originally written by Bernice Johnson Reagon for the black civil rights movement, Jones turns it into a lament for his late wife, who died of lung cancer in 2016. ""I was there in the hospital room with her for the last 10 days,"" he recalls. ""She was dying and she knew it. I said, 'Linda, I don't know what I'm going to do with myself and she said, 'You've got to carry on.' ""More or less, what she meant was, 'Don't crumble with me,' and that's what the song says to me."" The couple had been married since they were both 16 and, although Jones had several affairs, their marriage remained strong for six decades. ""She holds the connection to who I am,"" he wrote in his 2015 autobiography. ""That's exactly who she was,"" he says today. ""Your head gets a bit large when you start to get hit records. You think, 'Oh yeah, I'm on my way now.' But she would pull me up. She'd say, 'You don't really think you're Tom Jones, do you?'"" 'Like a tiger' Linda never let him forget Thomas John Woodward from Pontypridd, south Wales, the teenager who worked in a glove factory to support their young family in the 1950s. He'd always dreamed of being a singer, but his sonorous voice was almost too powerful (he was almost dropped from the school choir for drowning out his classmates) until rock 'n' roll came along. By 1963, he had changed his name to Tommy Scott and become the frontman for Welsh beat group The Senators, often downing 10 or 12 pints before hitting the stage for their raucous live shows. A year later, he was discovered by former Viscounts singer Gordon Mills, who changed the youngster's name again to Tom Jones and negotiated a record deal with Decca. His first single, Chills And Fever, failed to chart when it was released in late 1964. But a few months later, Sir Tom struck gold with It's Not Unusual, a swinging, big-band number delivered with all the subtlety and nuance of a hurricane. It topped the charts in the UK, entered the US top 10 and made Sir Tom a household name. Not bad, when you consider he'd originally recorded the track as a demo for Sandie Shaw. More hits followed - Delilah, Help Yourself, What's New Pussycat - and Sir Tom found himself swept up in the Swinging 60s scene. At one point, Eric Clapton even offered to be his guitarist. Even so, he was never considered cool by the music press. ""Because It's Not Unusual had brass on it, and I did What's New Pussycat after that... the public thinks, 'Well that's what Tom Jones is,'"" he says. ""And then I went to Las Vegas for a month straight, two shows a night. Elvis was there, Frank Sinatra was there, so it was a great place to be. But then you get labelled as a Vegas act. I'm not a Vegas act."" To his great discomfort, his ability to send female fans into a delirium detracted even more from his music. According to legend, it was a New Yorker who first threw her knickers on stage, at the Copacabana in 1968. After that, nearly every show ended with an avalanche of underwear. ""The only problem I found with it was that your image sometimes overshadows your talent,"" he says. ""Some reviews would say, 'The band struck up, Tom Jones came out, took off his shirt, and all the women screamed.' But not a bloody mention about what was I singing."" But his peers recognised his talent. ""It's like you opened your mouth and a tiger leapt out,"" actor Dustin Hoffman once proclaimed. One night in the late 1960s, Sir Paul McCartney even offered to write him a new song. Sir Tom leapt at the chance and, a few days later, he received a demo for The Long And Winding Road. ""Paul said, 'If you're going to do it, it's got to be your next single,'"" he recalls. ""But I already had a record coming out that Friday."" His manager, Gordon Mills, and producer, Peter Sullivan, laid out the options, telling the star: ""You've already got a record, the publicity is all done, Decca is chomping at the bit for you to get it out before Christmas... but if you really want to, we'll stop the record. Just bear in mind that it'll take at least a month in order to set up a recording session, and all that business."" ""So they put it all on me,"" he exclaims. ""And I said, 'Well, what do you think? Give me some feedback here.' And Peter said, 'Well, Decca's really on our backs.' So we didn't [do it]. We put a song out called Without Love, which was a big hit. But I missed that bloody song, because the timing wasn't right, you know? ""I told Paul that. I said: 'I'm sorry, but you know I love the song. You were quite right to send me that one, it's fantastic.' And then I heard Ray Charles do it a bit later and I thought, 'Damn, that's exactly what I would have done with it.' But it was too late. ""And that's gone on with Paul ever since. He wrote me another song when I was doing the Reload album [in 1999] and I said, 'Well, look, this album I'm doing now is all duets.' And he didn't fancy singing on it - so again it was the timing."" Fighting the US censors But if Sir Tom never got to duet with a Beatle, he still got to sing with dozens of his other idols. His 1960s TV show, This Is Tom Jones, saw him play host to the likes of Cher, Janis Joplin, Dusty Springfield, Ray Charles, Joe Cocker and Liza Minelli. But the star ran into problems with the US TV network ABC, who bristled at his support of black artists - whether he was covering protest anthems like The Temptations' Ball Of Confusion, or inviting Aretha Franklin and Little Richard to appear as guests. ""They [ABC] didn't want black people on there for a start-off,"" he recalls. ""And when I would do a song with a black female, the censor would say, 'Don't get too close to her, you can't touch her.' ""Well, I would do it on purpose. I'd say, '[Expletive] you, I'm gonna do it anyway.' ""I remember once I had Leslie Uggams on, she was the star of a TV show called Roots, and we did Somewhere from West Side Story. ""The censor said, 'You're looking at one another too much.' And I said, 'This is about one another. The song goes, there's a place for us. I'm not saying it to the audience. I'm saying it to the girl, and she's saying it to me.' ""So I was up against all that. I had to push it, to get certain things done. And when those episodes had big ratings, they realised that I was right."" First-take vocals These days, Sir Tom is still a TV fixture in his guise as a mentor on The Voice. There, he plays the elder statesman of pop, revered even by the other judges. And, as he starts his ninth decade, he's still charting new ground. His last few albums took Johnny Cash's American Recordings series as their template, mining the folk-blues canon and illuminating it with grizzled wisdom. But the musical choices on Surrounded By Time are more eclectic, and the star has discovered new shades to his voice. On Talking Reality Television Blues, he takes on the role of narrator, tracing the history of the small screen from the moon landings to the coronation of Donald Trump, over a shuffling, Radiohead guitar riff. ""An old man with a comb-over came along and sold us the moon / And we stayed tuned in, now here we are / Reality killed by a reality star."" ""I was there from the beginning of television, you see,"" says Sir Tom. ""In 1952, I had tuberculosis and I was quarantined in my house for two years so my mother and father bought me a TV set, and we watched the coronation. ""And then I witnessed the Moon landing when I was in the States, and then Donald Trump, I used to sing at his hotels in Atlantic City. I thought he was just this playboy businessman. ""So I saw these things unfold - and that's why this song appealed to me."" Throughout the record, Sir Tom's tone and control are impeccable. He says many of the tracks, including the seven-minute highlight This Is The Sea, were recorded in a single take. ""It was more or less a rehearsal,"" he says. ""I was in the studio with the rhythm section - I hadn't even got into the vocal booth yet for separation - and we hit it right away."" So how does he keep those vocals in such good shape? ""It's luck. It's a God-given gift,"" he says, before conceding that cutting back his alcohol intake might have helped. Oh, and he works out every day, too. ""I've got an exercise bike in my bedroom. And I've got this inversion table, where I hang upside down for about five minutes every day. It gets the blood rushing to your head, which is great, and it elongates your spine as well - so if you've got any problems with your back, I highly recommend it.

"Since becoming chief executive of The Walt Disney Company in 2005, Bob Iger has masterminded the Mouse House's growth into an entertainment empire with the takeovers of Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm and 21st Century Fox. The studio's films have taken $8.3bn (£6.4bn) at box offices worldwide so far this year, and account for about $4 in every $10 spent at North American cinemas. Following the publication of his memoir, titled The Ride of a Lifetime (Disney does theme parks too), he gave his only UK interview to BBC media editor Amol Rajan. Here are five key things he said, including why ""less is more"" in the Star Wars universe, why Martin Scorsese was wrong to compare Marvel films to theme parks, and why Disney didn't go through with a deal to buy Twitter. 'Too many Star Wars films' Disney bought Marvel in 2009 and turned it into film's most lucrative franchise. There have been 10 Marvel films in the past three years, with eight more coming in the next three. Is there a danger of over-saturation? ""Marvel is just doing sensationally well,"" Iger replies. ""The last film they released [Avengers: Endgame] had the highest global box office in the history of the motion picture business, and their pipeline is very, very rich with new stories and new characters and new adventures and new superhero exploits. So not true."" It's a different story with Star Wars, though. After a run of a film a year for five years, ending with The Rise of Skywalker this December, there will now be a gap until the next instalment in 2022. ""I have said publicly that I think we made and released too many Star Wars films over a short period of time,"" Iger says. ""I have not said that they were disappointing in any way. I've not said that I'm disappointed in their performance. I just think that there's something so special about a Star Wars film, and less is more."" Britain must wait for Disney+ There may have been too many Star Wars films, but there clearly haven't been enough Star Wars TV shows. Disney is launching its own streaming service, Disney+, in the US on 12 November, with the highlights including The Mandalorian, an original live action series that takes place after the fall of the Empire in 1983's The Return of the Jedi. But British viewers will have to wait to watch it. Or anything else on Disney+. For up to a year. ""We haven't announced a date for launch in the UK,"" Iger says. ""Our plan is to roll out Disney+ in most of Western Europe within the first year that we launch in the US."" Scorsese 'has never watched Marvel' The legendary Taxi Driver and Goodfellas director recently put the boot into Marvel by saying they are closer to theme parks than real films because it ""isn't the cinema of human beings trying to convey emotional, psychological experiences to another human being"". ""Ouch!"" is Iger's reply. ""Martin Scorsese is a great film-maker. I admire him immensely. He's made some great films. I would debate him on this subject. First of all, Marvel's making movies. They're movies. That's what Martin Scorsese makes. And they're good movies."" He goes on: ""I don't think he's ever seen a Marvel film. Anyone who's seen a Marvel film could not in all truth make that statement."" Ouch! Succession 'reminds me of a certain family' Disney completed a $71bn (£54bn) deal for Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox - including the likes of X-Men, The Simpsons and Fantastic Four - earlier this year after a bidding war with Comcast. ""As, you'd expect, Rupert is a tough negotiator. But he's true to his word. When he says yes to something, he sticks to it,"" Iger says. He also lifts the lid on the lengths he went to before a Fox board meeting in London in 2018 in order to win the deal. He wanted to make a new bid to Murdoch in person without Comcast getting wind of his plan, but was worried the Disney private jet would be picked up by online plane trackers. ""We decided that if we flew a Disney corporate plane to London, it may tip Comcast off that we may be coming in with a bid that was higher than theirs, and we didn't want anybody to know that,"" he says. ""We decided we would leave our plane in Belfast and then charter another plane from Belfast to London so that we wouldn't fly in with the Disney jet."" He asked to meet Murdoch in the afternoon before Fox's evening board meeting. That wheeling and dealing has echoes of TV hit Succession, about a media mogul and his family. Iger said he had seen a few episodes. ""There are things in it that remind me of a certain family that's been involved in the media business. But I think, you know, there's a lot of fiction in it as well."" 'Cold feet' over buying Twitter Iger's book reveals Disney also came close to a deal to buy Twitter, but he pulled the plug at the last minute. He says he got ""cold feet"" because it was ""too controversial"". ""I thought there were responsibilities we would have to take on in running Twitter in terms of its position in the world and its effect on the world,"" he says. ""While I was intrigued with what it might represent in terms of opportunity for us, I thought the responsibilities would burden us with things that would be potentially too distracting, too controversial, too challenging to manage."" Listen to the full interview with Bob Iger on BBC Sounds in Making the Mouse Roar. It is customary in most examinations of a CEO's tenure to highlight errors and missed opportunities, find competitors who will bad mouth said individual, and, when it comes to those who lead global corporate giants, question whether any financial successes have been justly shared, within the company and across wider society. To immerse yourself in coverage of Bob Iger is to find journalists struggling and generally failing on all three fronts. Mr Iger's reign at The Walt Disney Company does present challenges to even the most sceptical of journalists. Read more from Amol Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

"The duo's Twitter account said he recently received treatment for oesophageal cancer but died peacefully in his sleep in the early hours. Known for their rock and cockney style, Chas and Dave enjoyed the height of their fame in the 1970s and 1980s with hits such as Rabbit and Snooker Loopy. They also performed four FA Cup final songs with Tottenham Hotspur FC. The statement on Chas and Dave's Twitter page read: ""It is with tremendous sadness that we announce the passing of our very own Chas Hodges."" It said the guitarist, pianist and vocalist had died from organ failure. There was also a Twitter tribute from Tottenham Hotspur. Born in north London in 1943, Chas's career began as a session musician in the 1950 and 1960s, working with producer Joe Meek and stars including Jerry Lee Lewis and Gene Vincent. He was also in the band the Outlaws with Ritchie Blackmore. In 1966, as a member of Cliff Bennett And The Rebel Rousers, he appeared alongside the Beatles on their final British tour. Chas went on to team up with guitarist Dave Peacock in the 1970s.

Chas disclosed in early 2017 that he had been diagnosed with cancer of the oesophagus after he struggled to swallow a glass of water. He underwent chemotherapy and began performing again but in August, Chas and Dave cancelled their forthcoming gigs on doctor's advice. In a statement at the time, Chas said: ""In my life as a musician/entertainer I would say the most depressing thing to have to do is to have to cancel a gig or gigs. ""Fortunately, throughout my career of thousands of gigs with Dave or in other bands, these times have been very few and far between, and only extreme illness in the past (and I mean extreme) illness has prompted me/us to have to make this decision."" People who had worked with Chas have paid tribute on social media. Former boxer Frank Bruno tweeted: ""Worked with Chas & Dave loads of times in the 1980's and had a good laugh with them every time. ""I can still remember I was always driving home from working with them singing Rabbit Rabbit or London Girls."" Comedian Sir Lenny Henry posted: ""What a shame. When they were on Tiswas they were always kind, respectful and played live. RIP Chas."" The DJ and TV presenter Iain Lee said he was ""absolutely gutted"", adding: Chas had always been ""a real gentleman to me and very generous with his time"". Describing him as ""one of the best"", he recalled the story of how Chas had played piano as a member of a ""spontaneous band"" at Eric Clapton's 1979 wedding to Pattie Boyd - alongside Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr and George Harrison.

"Whether he was directing Elizabeth Taylor as Shakespeare's Shrew, staging more than 120 operas or serving in the Italian Senate, Zeffirelli remained a cultural icon well into his 80s. The maestro worked on a famously epic scale in film, theatre and opera, where his productions formed the core repertory of such houses as the Met and La Scala. He once said of himself: ""I'm not the greatest director of opera in the world. I'm the only one."" Gianfranco Zeffirelli was born on 12 February 1923 on the outskirts of Florence. The illegitimate son of a philandering merchant, young Franco's surname was given to him by his mother. She wanted ""Zeffiretti"", a word meaning ""little breezes"" taken from a Mozart opera, but the wrong spelling appeared on his birth certificate, and he became Zeffirelli. It was to his mother, who died when he was just six, that he attributed what he referred to as his understanding of the female psyche. ""Women represent the warmth of life - they're frail and vulnerable. They only become unpleasant when they feel the need to create a defence, and they exaggerate. That's why they become divas."" He grew up among English expatriates in Florence, an experience he returned to in his film Tea with Mussolini. His early training as an architect was interrupted by war; Zeffirelli fought with the Italian partisans and became an interpreter for the British army after the Allied invasion of Italy. First film In peacetime he returned to his architectural studies until a viewing of Laurence Olivier's film of Henry V inspired him to move to the theatre. His sometime lover Luchino Visconti gave him a role as assistant director in the 1948 film La Terra Trema. Over the next decade, he worked with a number of directors before moving on to design and direct stage performances in his own right His first film as a director was The Taming of the Shrew in 1967, originally intended as a vehicle for the Italian actors Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroianni. In the event, Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor took the leading roles after the couple had invested more than $1m in the production, in return for a share of the profits instead of a salary. The film was well received by both critics and audience although Shakespearean purists were incensed by Zeffirelli's cavalier approach to the original text. It was his follow-up film, Romeo & Juliet, that cemented his reputation. He cast two then unknown teenagers, Leonard Whiting and Olivia Hussey, in the title roles. Oscar winners Because of the age of the stars, the film became popular among teenagers and was used by some schools as the definitive film version of the play. However, the film was controversial because, in one scene, 15-year-old Olivia Hussey is clearly nude. For many, she was too young to to play the part in this way. There was a story at the time that she was banned from the film's premier because she was too young to witness her own nudity, but this is almost certainly an urban myth. Imaginative casting became something of a trademark; he would later cast Mel Gibson in Hamlet. Brother Sun, Sister Moon, about St Francis of Assisi, saw Zeffirelli move into religious themes, which he continued with his miniseries Jesus of Nazareth. Robert Powell as Christ led a cast of stars that included no fewer than seven Oscar winners. When it was shown by ITV in the UK at Easter 1977, it attracted an audience of more than 20 million. The series was shown throughout the Western world and still makes frequent Easter appearances on TV. Throughout this period, Zeffirelli continued to direct opera, his first love. He staged performances with many of the greatest singers of the era including Dame Joan Sutherland, Tito Gobbi and Maria Callas. His enduring successes included Tosca, which ran for 40 years in repertory at London's Royal Opera House. Jane Eyre ""I have always believed that opera is a planet where the muses work together, join hands and celebrate all the arts."" Callas, whom he idolised, provided the subject for his 2002 film, Callas Forever, about the last days of her life. He admired her most because, he said, ""she couldn't accept to compromise"". He continued directing films with mixed success. The Champ, released in 1979, was not well received and Endless Love, which appeared two years later, was panned by the critics. However, a 1996 adaptation of Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre was a success. Zeffirelli held some forthright political opinions while serving for two terms in the Italian senate as a member of Silvio Berlusconi's right-wing Forza Italia party. He derided communists as ""frauds about to take over my country"" and called for the death penalty for women who had had abortions. He later served as an adviser to the Ministry of Culture. In 1996, he revealed his homosexuality but found himself under attack from the gay community for his support of the Roman Catholic Church's stance on gay issues. A committed Anglophile, he become the first Italian citizen to receive an honorary knighthood from the UK, which was awarded in 2004. Zeffirelli was once asked what had kept him going long after many of his peers had retired. ""It's the anticipation, the expectation, that's what keeps you going,"" he said. ""So many things, it's a miracle. A superior hand has helped in so many moments of my life.""",Franco Zeffirelli's bold ideas and enduring energy made him one the 20th Century's most creative and prolific directors.

"The Baltic, which opened a decade ago, had more than 500,000 visitors last year, when it hosted the Turner Prize. The new £10m arts centre, named Baltic 39, will open in April in a Grade II listed former printing warehouse. The Baltic said the new space would give artists ""creative freedom to experiment and innovate"". The building will also house studios for 32 artists. Named after its location at 39 High Bridge, over the River Tyne from the main Baltic gallery, the new branch will also provide a home for Northumbria University's fine art students. A statement said the gallery would allow artists and curators to ""stretch the boundaries of contemporary art practice"". Its first exhibition, which opens on 6 April, will be curated by sculptor Phyllida Barlow and will use the work of 12 UK-based artists to examine the process of making art. Arts Council England will fund the exhibition programme. Arts Council regional director Alison Clark-Jenkins said: ""A pioneering approach to partnership between public, cultural and academic institutions has resulted in a nationally significant visual arts facility, developing both artists and practice. ""At times this has been a long journey for the Arts Council and our partners - but we've ended up in a very exciting place."" Newcastle City Council, which owns the building, said the building's redevelopment had cost £10m.",The Baltic art gallery in Gateshead is to open an offshoot gallery in a new arts complex in neighbouring Newcastle.
"The episode featured a pregnant Somali woman who had undergone the procedure as a child, leading her to go through a traumatic delivery. Viewers called the programme's makers ""brave"" and praised the show for its ""sensitive"" portrayal of the subject. More than 8.5 million tuned in to watch the episode, giving the 1960s-set drama 36% of the audience share. ""Maybe this despicable practice will be confined to history with coverage like this,"" the author Jan Harvey tweeted. ""Well done @BBCOne brave."" Another viewer tweeted: ""Seriously impressed with @BBCOne for raising the issue of #FGM."" Anti-FGM campaigner Nimco Ali, who runs the charity Daughters of Eve, was a consultant on the show. She worked closely with the programme makers and travelled to Somaliland, where the character of Nadifa is from, to meet doctors dealing with FGM. The programme was followed by tweets from the NHS and the NSPCC offering advice, help and support.

"""I don't want to profit from my work on the film,"" wrote Timothee Chalamet on Instagram. The 22-year-old is one of a number of actors who have distanced themselves from Allen over historic accusations that he molested his adopted daughter. Allen, 82, has repeatedly denied the claims and has never been prosecuted. Chalamet, who was nominated for a Bafta last week for his role in Call Me By Your Name, worked with Allen last year on the director's forthcoming film, entitled A Rainy Day in New York. Jude Law, Selena Gomez, Elle Fanning and Rebecca Hall also have roles in the Amazon Studios production, which is scheduled for release later this year. Last week, Hall said she now regretted her decision to appear in the film - adding that she had donated her salary to the Time's Up Legal Defence Fund. Gomez has yet to comment, though her mother, Mandy Teefey, has given her thoughts on the subject in a message to a fan who contacted her on Instagram. ""No one can make Selena do anything she doesn't want to,"" she wrote. ""I had a long talk with her about not working with [Allen] and it didn't click."" 'Respect and dignity' In his post, Chalamet said he would be giving his salary to Time's Up, RAINN (Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network) and the LGBT Community Centre in New York. The actor said he wanted ""to be worthy of standing shoulder to shoulder with the brave artists who are fighting for all people to be treated with the respect and dignity they deserve"". ""I have, to this point, chosen projects from the perspective of a young actor trying to walk in the footsteps of more seasoned actors I admire,"" he wrote. ""But I am learning that a good role isn't the only criteria for accepting a job."" In Call Me By Your Name, Chalamet plays a gifted music student who embarks on a romance with an older man while holidaying in Italy. The New York-born actor can also be seen in Lady Bird, Greta Gerwig's coming-of-age story about a precocious teenager's relationship with her mother. Gerwig, who worked with Allen on his 2012 comedy To Rome With Love, has also expressed regret for accepting a role from the Oscar-winning film-maker. ""If I had known then what I know now, I would not have acted in the film,"" she said last week. ""I have not worked for him again, and I will not work for him again."" Last year, actor Griffin Newman said he ""deeply regretted"" taking a role in A Rainy Day in New York and that he had been ""a coward"" for not turning it down. Yet not every Hollywood actor has disavowed Allen, director of such Oscar-winning films as Annie Hall, Hannah and Her Sisters and Midnight in Paris. Alec Baldwin, who worked with Allen on Alice, Blue Jasmine and To Rome With Love, said the ""renunciation of him and his work"" was ""unfair and sad"". ""Woody Allen was investigated forensically by two states"" - New York and Connecticut - ""and no charges were filed,"" he tweeted on Tuesday. He described working with Allen as ""one of the privileges"" of his career. 'Time up for my predator' Allen was investigated over a 1992 claim by his adoptive daughter, Dylan Farrow, that he sexually assaulted her at the family's Connecticut home. Prosecutors chose not to charge the film-maker and he has always denied the allegations, which he claimed had been fabricated by his former partner Mia Farrow. The allegations resurfaced last week ahead of the Golden Globes award ceremony in Los Angeles in a series of tweets posted by Dylan Farrow. ""No predator should be spared by virtue of their 'talent',"" she wrote, adding that she would be watching the ceremony ""to see if now, finally, time is up for my predator too"". Wonder Wheel, the film Allen made before A Rainy Day in New York starring Kate Winslet and Justin Timberlake, will be released in the UK on 9 March.

"By Mark SavageMusic reporter It will be the first new material from the musician since his ambitious triple album The Epic was released last year. Washington told the BBC the music would come from a ""wishlist"" of ""about 30 songs"" he has been working on. The star, who also scored Kendrick Lamar's To Pimp A Butterfly, will play the Proms with the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra and choral backing. ""I've been reading about it and I'm really looking forward to it,"" he said. ""I'll definitely prepare some of the music from Epic, but I'm also working on some new stuff we could perform that'll be handy. ""It'll be a world premiere."" Washington has been described as ""the biggest thing to hit jazz for years,"" thanks to The Epic, which was the first jazz release to cross over to mainstream music audiences in some time. Mixing jazz with hip-hop collage, funk, soul, swing and gospel, the record framed Washington's fiery saxophone solos with a 32-piece orchestra and a 20-person choir, whose parts he wrote and orchestrated over a five-year period. The basic tracks were laid down during a marathon, month-long recording session in 2011, where Washington and his bandmates laid down enough material for eight albums. It was an ambitious undertaking for the group, who together form The West Coast Get Down collective. They were all working musicians (Washington toured with Chaka Khan, Herbie Hancock and Lauryn Hill) who turned down paying gigs to work together. ""There was the financial aspect - the more studio time you buy, the better deal you get,"" says Washington. ""But more than that, it was just so hard to get everybody in the room at the same time, because everyone was playing with different artists."" When the sessions drew to a close, the saxophonist laid claim to 45 songs (""hours and hours and hours of material""), 17 of which made it onto The Epic. But despite the album's daunting, three-hour running time, the record made many critics' end-of-year lists, and went on to win the American Music Prize - which is the US equivalent of the Mercury Prize. ""The album could easily have fallen short of my ambitions - but to go past them? It's an amazing feeling,"" marvels Washington, who is preparing to launch his European tour next month. Inspired by a dream about a warrior's journey, The Epic is a mystical, spiritual record - but it also contains political elements. The album's penultimate track, Malcolm's Theme, sets Ossie Davis's funeral eulogy for Malcolm X to music, giving way to a plea for understanding drawn from a speech by the civil rights leader from 1965. It led writer Greg Tate to christen Washington ""the jazz voice of black lives matter"". But the musician points out that his album pre-dates the current movement, which was sparked by the 2013 acquittal of George Zimmerman over the shooting of unarmed teenager Trayvon Martyn. ""I've had to take my own stance on something like police brutality,"" he says, having experienced ""intimidation"" and ""misuse of power"" growing up in the city of Inglewood, California. ""You're not safe in your own community, from the people who are supposed to be making your community safe,"" he explains, ""so I feel like my music represents that, because I am part of that. ""I am the big, dark-skinned African American male that they look at as a threat... even though I'm not. I don't have any criminal activity, I'm not violent, I don't carry a weapon but I fit their profile of someone who's a threat. And that notion that it's ok to use lethal force on anyone that looks this way... that's something that we've lived with for years. That's nothing new. ""So I think the main issue is really a denial of this [situation] where we've been stuck for almost the last 50 years. We have to accept this is a real issue and there are certain people trying to hide it because they don't want it to go away."" But he's cautiously optimistic of the opportunities for change, as technology means incidents of police brutality and intimidation are being shared widely on social media and, latterly, mainstream news. ""It's almost like we're living in the shadows then all of a sudden the light is shining on you. It feels like we're at a crossroads. Are we going to try to deal with this, or are we going to find another way to pretend it doesn't exist?"" Many of these themes also surfaced on Kendrick Lamar's To Pimp A Butterfly. Washington is exceptionally proud of his involvement, calling the album a ""monumental achievement"". And he laughs as he remembers the strict security surrounding the recording sessions. ""They'd take your ID and everything,"" he says. ""It was all top secret - like we were creating a time machine or something!"" To Pimp A Butterfly became the most critically-acclaimed record of 2015 - and was widely tipped to win album of the year at the Grammys in February. When it was beaten by Taylor Swift, Washington simply tweeted an emoji of a broken heart. ""The Grammys feel like the official [statement of] what's happened in music,"" he says. ""It's a beautiful thing that Kendrick's doing and it's having such an effect on the world, so I just felt 'this is what is happening'. So the grief when it [didn't win] takes away from that. That was what the broken heart was. ""But the awards, the money, the fame... all that stuff doesn't really compare to the music he's made. In my mind, he's already won. So it didn't take me too long to get over it!"" The acclaim for To Pimp A Butterfly certainly helped raise Washington's profile - The Epic was promoted as a kind of jazz sequel - but the music stands on its own. He dislikes being labelled a ""crossover artist"", saying ""music doesn't really exist within boundaries like that. ""I don't feel like I've really crossed over, moreso than risen up."" But he accepts that his music has the capacity to reach people who are put off by traditional jazz. ""There's an idea that jazz is very technical - someone trying to show that they have a mastery of their instrument. My music has always had an emotional, expressive approach - so the skillset that I have, I don't necessarily put on display. I use it in a way that helps me express some bigger idea or emotion."" The musician's wide appeal explains why he's been invited to play both Glastonbury and the Proms this August. Washington says he's been studying the history of the latter festival, hence his decision to premiere new material there. The only problem he faces now is how to select the setlist. ""I have well over 100 songs that I have to, at some point, try to record,"" he says. ""But it's hard because I just keep writing. Music is like that, it never stops."" Kamasi Washington tours the UK at the end of June, playing in Glasgow, Manchester, Birmingham and Bristol as well as Glastonbury Festival. His late-night Prom takes place at London's Royal Albert Hall on 30 August.",Jazz saxophonist Kamasi Washington says he will premiere new music when he plays the BBC Proms in August.
"The BBC has announced it will overhaul the selection process for next year. Three songs will each be performed in two different styles by two different artists, with one act from each pair going through to a final public vote.

"Over many years, he worked with Roald Dahl on some of his most famous books and his sketches captured the very essence of Willy Wonka, Matilda and the BFH. His own heavily illustrated and quirky books include Mister Magnolia, Zagazoo and Loveykins. Born Quentin Saxby Blake, he was born in 1932 in Sidcup, which is now part of south east London, and studied English at Cambridge. After National Service he did a postgraduate diploma at the University of London, going on to teach at the Royal College of Art, where he was the head of illustration between 1978-86. He was first published at the age of 16 in the satirical magazine Punch - while he was still a pupil a Chislehurst and Sidcup Grammar School. A later cover featured his illustration of a weightlifter at full stretch being aped by a dog carrying a bone. He said: ""I can remember getting a letter from the art editor congratulating me on being the youngest contributor and I thought 'this is alright!'. I started drawing for print then."" From there, he went on to illustrate nearly 300 books with writers such as Joan Aiken, Michael Rosen and John Yeoman. Blake also worked on more than 150 episodes of the BBC children's show Jackanory, providing the illustrations for the books narrated for the young audience. 'Big chap' ""I draw every day - unless I'm being interviewed,"" Blake told the BBC. ""What is nice is to have different kinds of things to do."" Blake began working with Dahl after a meeting in 1975 set up by their publisher. By that point, Dahl had already published some of his most famous works including James and The Giant Peach, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Fantastic Mr Fox. ""Initially I was rather apprehensive because he was a big chap and very famous, but it was a relationship that worked,"" said Blake. ""Because I had established myself as an illustrator, I had something to bring to it."" Blake became the first ever Children's Laureate when the position was created in 1999, using his tenure to promote literature for the young. Among his other accolades are the JM Barrie lifetime achievement award, which he received in 2008, the Hans Christian Andersen Award for illustration in 2002 and an honorary degree from the Anglia Ruskin university in Cambridge. He was made an OBE in 1988, a CBE in 2004 and will receive his knighthood at Buckingham Palace during 2013, for his services to illustration. The 80-year-old's most recent collaboration has been with comic actor and writer David Walliams. They first worked together on Walliams' debut children's novel The Boy in the Dress, which was published in 2008. He admitted he was initially apprehensive about working with the Little Britain co-creator. ""I was also worried it would have loads of projectile vomiting,"" he said, ""but I wanted to do it as soon as I read it."" He added: ""I had breakfast with David and I think we were on the same wavelength. It was very nice because he wanted me to do it and I got so involved in it that I did twice as many drawings as I was supposed to."" 'Part of the culture' The pair have now worked on five books together, including Walliams' latest book Mr Stink, about a girl who befriends a local tramp and hides him in her garden shed to stop him being driven out of town. Walliams said of Blake: ""His work kind of means children's books somehow, so even if you haven't studied it or don't pay attention to who illustrators are, you know his work. ""It has been copied everywhere so many times that it is now part of the culture."" He added: ""I think the magic of his work is that it doesn't tell you exactly what the person looks like, it allows you add your own imagination to it."" As well as illustrating books, Blake also does work with hospitals and mental health units, decorating buildings with his sketches. ""It's a different kind of brief, a different kind of audience. A lot of the pictures I do in hospitals are to cheer up gaunt surroundings,"" he said. He was also the instigator of the House of Illustration project, which aims to open a museum dedicated to illustration in London by 2014. However, even the most beloved of artists have their critics and one slight levelled at Blake is the consistently upbeat nature of his drawings. ""There are a lot of smiles about, it's true,"" he admitted. ""People have come up and said 'thank you for your work' - and 'joy' is the word they've used, but I've also been reproached for it, for being too cheerful. ""But if you add a smile, it doesn't make it necessarily joyful.""","Illustrator Quentin Blake, who has been knighted in the New Year Honours list, is perhaps best known for the distinctive drawings that helped bring to life some of the most popular characters in children's literature."
"By David SillitoArts Correspondent This is a response to the accusation that the corporation is ""imperial in its ambitions"" made by Chancellor George Osborne (along with several newspapers). Partnerships with cultural bodies, sharing news with local newspapers, opening up the iPlayer to third party content - the mood music is all about co-operation rather than competition. And with £650m being cut from the BBC's income by shifting the cost of free TV licences for the over-75s on to the corporation, there is little scope for any expansion. However, one of the first pieces of information to emerge from this review is the plan to increase broadcasting to North Korea, the Middle East and Russian-speaking populations. The global broadcasting landscape is changing fast. Russia and China have been rapidly expanding their international services. The corporation has also seen its services jammed and blocked in a number of countries. The BBC says it needs to respond especially in countries without a free press and in places that are in turmoil. The World Service has a global reputation - but what does that mean to the next generation? The speed of change in technology and competition could quickly erode any broadcaster's audience. The problem is the BBC is going to have to change and that is going to cost money. The technological tidal wave of the digital revolution is impossible to predict. Ten years ago as the BBC bid for its current charter, there were no smartphones or tablets, YouTube was only a few months old, Amazon was essentially a bookseller. Quite what any media organisation needs to do to stay relevant in such a shifting landscape is anyone's guess. As Armando Iannucci said in his recent speech in Edinburgh about media experts: ""Their guess is as good as yours, only more expensive."" Apple is challenging Radio One, Amazon has Top Gear's team, Netflix is outbidding the BBC in drama. In the BBC's ""Blue Room"" - a store of technology about to be released on to the marketplace - you can play with Amazon's voice-activated media player, Facebook's virtual reality system, Oculus Rift and Apple's carplay radio stations. 'Ride two horses' The BBC's prediction is that over the next 10 years its income will shrink from 20% of UK TV revenues to 12%. The plans for bigger and bolder drama and giving people the chance to ""binge"" watch is a recognition of the new competitive environment. The BBC's problem is looking after its core audience and responding to a technological transformation. ""Having to ride two horses"" is the phrase used in Tony Hall's speech. Take news for example. Around five million people a night still watch the Six O'Clock News, but for a growing part of the audience the news is a phone-only service. The future, Tony Hall says, is to move from ""rolling"" to ""streaming"" - the question is how long you keep the ""rolling"" part going when you need to fund new ""streaming"" services. Older audiences still want services such as the News Channel and they are heavy consumers of the BBC and a growing part of the population. Younger, digital first consumers expect something different. Serving two such radically different audiences will take money and the BBC has just taken a £650m cut. Those ""tough choices"" mentioned in the speech is the theme that has not yet been announced. 'Friendly' persona ""We will inevitably have to either close or reduce some services,"" said Lord Hall. This speech was the BBC showing its friendly co-operative forward-facing persona. The question of which services it has to close or change radically is the topic that was left hanging in the air. The language of the speech about the BBC being a ""curator"" or a ""platform"" for British content was aimed at organisations and politicians who see the broadcasting landscape being utterly transformed by largely American technology companies. This, however, is far from the end of the debate about the future of the BBC. Expect more announcements in the weeks to come. Today was the good news, trying to make the positive case for the BBC - the consequences of cuts and technological change will come later.","""This is not an expansionist BBC"" is perhaps the key political line in Monday's announcements from director general Tony Hall, as he set out the corporation's plans ahead of the BBC's charter renewal in 2016."
"By Steven McIntoshEntertainment reporter at the Toronto Film Festival The US actress appears in The Goldfinch, based on the 2014 Pulitzer-winning novel by Donna Tartt. The movie had its premiere in Toronto on Sunday. Paulson, who plays Xandra, told BBC News she was ""obsessed"" with the book, but knew when auditioning she wouldn't be the director's first choice. ""I don't think I was at the top of the ideas that were percolating,"" she said. ""I had read it years ago when it first came out. And I just remember saying out loud, 'If they make a movie of this, I would love to play Xandra'. ""And I was not the choice of [director] John Crowley at the beginning. I think he had a particular image in mind, which is the image you see in the movie, which is not how I [usually] present."" Xandra could not be further as a character from Marcia Clark, the whip-smart lawyer Paulson played in The People v OJ Simpson, a role that bagged her an Emmy Award for outstanding lead actress in a limited series. Her character in The Goldfinch is the gum-chewing, scantily-clad, spray-tanned girlfriend of protagonist Theo's father, but she knew the character was a departure from her usual roles. ""So I hired someone to put a wig on my head, I got a spray tan, I brought cigarettes into my audition, spent an hour in my car screaming to make my voice have a bit of a rasp, because that's how Donna Tartt describes Xandra's speaking voice,"" Paulson says. ""I did all that and made the tape and I got a call saying, 'Uh-oh, you did very well'. And they weren't expecting that. Sometimes I think you have to change your physical appearance... I understand why it was hard for people to make the jump [from playing Marcia Clark]."" More from Toronto: Crowley told BBC News he was ""a huge fan"" of Paulson. ""But when she was mentioned for Xandra I was like 'really?' She's great but I couldn't quite see that,"" he said. ""But boy, is the last laugh on me. She went at it with a great character actor's eye for detail, a love for the book, and she just colonised that role in a way that was amazing."" Even when her audition tape was approved by Crowley, however, Paulson's casting still had to be signed off by the film studio. ""I still had to wait for Warner Brothers. Everybody had to approve everything and I was like, urgh, I just did Ocean's 8 for them!"" she laughs. ""I wanted the part so badly and they made me wait it out for so long."" The finished product premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival. But while it was originally considered a serious awards contender, some critics were not convinced. ""It's neither a rousing success nor an embarrassing failure, falling somewhere in between, closer to admirable attempt,"" wrote Benjamin Lee in The Guardian. ""[The storyline] is like taking a long road trip that reaches a dead end, and as the film starts to wrap up, there's not enough of a throughline to justify both the film's mammoth length and its grand sense of self."" Writing in Collider, Matt Goldberg said: ""The Goldfinch is not only a vapid prestige picture; it's also grotesque. Rather than exploring tragedy and grief in any meaningful or thoughtful way, it offers a vague homily. It seeks to comfort without compassion."" ""A gauzy, bloated slab of Oscar bait"" is how the movie was described by Dave Ehrlich in IndieWire. ""The big problem with The Goldfinch - a lifeless film that doesn't consist of scenes so much as it does an awkward jumble of other, smaller problems stacked on top of each other like kids inside a trench coat - is that it mistakes its source material for a great work of art. ""Crowley's simple direction flattens the entire story into a styleless mash, while [Peter] Straughan's nonlinear screenplay knots it into a self-conflicted tangle. The result is a stately, lugubrious mess that feels at odds with such an eccentric adventure."" Donna Tartt herself took a fairly hands-off approach to the film. Most of the cast members had no contact with her during filming, and nor have they had feedback directly from her. As the director, Crowley is one of the few who met Tartt - an author who rarely does interviews and doesn't keep a high profile. ""I met her once,"" says Crowley, ""which was when I was being interviewed for the job. I had a series of interviews with the producer and Warner Brothers, and the last stage of that was being sent to meet Donna in Charlottesville. ""We had lunch together, which was fantastic. There was already a first draft of the script at this point. I talked about my approach to it as much as one can in an hour, but gave her the essential elements that I felt were important to maintain. And I got back on a plane and by the time I got back to London the next day, it had been announced in the press that I got the thumbs up! ""She was in the middle of writing her next novel, so she wasn't involved in the practical details, so I didn't have any contact with her from that point on. She presumably gave me her blessing, and that was the end of that."" Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts at bbcnewsents.

"The US actress was joined by the film's director Darren Aronofsky, who won the Italian film festival's top prize in 2008 for The Wrestler. This year's jury, which awards the Golden Lion trophy, is headed by Quentin Tarantino. Some 79 movies are expected to premiere over the festival's 11-day run. The Golden Lion will be fought over by 22 films from directors around the world, although no British films will be vying for the prize. 'No idea' Speaking on the opening day, Inglourious Basterds director Tarantino said: ""I love being on juries. I've yet to find it difficult, but I've always ended up being with, not like-minded, but passion-minded artists every time I've done it. ""I love the idea, what I love about being on the jury is, I love seeing a whole bunch of new movies from all over the world. I have no real idea about what to expect. ""I might have an idea about an actor in it, or the director in it or something, but I really don't know what to expect and it's all over the world there and so usually when you watch the movie, you don't know what you're going to see until it starts playing and it either grabs you or it doesn't."" Other films in the main competition include Sophia Coppola's Somewhere, Julian Schnabel's Miral, starring Freida Pinto and Willem Dafoe, and France's Francois Ozon's Potiche, which features Gerard Depardieu and Catherine Deneuve. Psychological thriller Black Swan centres on the competitive world of ballet, with Portman's character fighting to take the crown of prima ballerina of a New York company. Aronofsky has called the film a companion piece to The Wrestler, which saw its star Mickey Rourke nominated for a best actor Oscar. ""The more I looked into the world of ballet, I actually started to see all these similarities to the world of wrestling,"" he said. ""They both have these performers that use their bodies in sort of extremely, intense physical ways. Their entire performance is based on intense physicality."" 'Always intriguing' Speaking after the screening, Portman told the BBC: ""I hadn't seen it before last night and I watched it along with the rest of the audience, it looked completely different to how I imagined, but I was blown away by it."" Talking about the perfectionism demanded of the role, she added: ""Both me and the character were going through the same things, just trying to get our art right. ""Ballet is an incredible discipline - you have to have so much concentration, be willing to work hard, and be willing to experience great pain."" Reviews for Black Swan have, so far, been largely positive. ""Powerful, gripping and always intriguing, it also features a lead performance from Natalie Portman that elevates her from a substantial leading actress to major star likely to be lifting awards in the near future,"" wrote David Gittens in The Telegraph. And Geoffrey Macnab in The Independent wrote: ""The film looks bound to win its star, Natalie Portman, plaudits and award nominations for her searing performance as the ambitious but insecure Nina."" The Venice Film Festival runs until 11 September.","Natalie Portman graced the red carpet for the premiere of her latest film Black Swan, which had the honour of opening the Venice Film Festival."
"By Emma JonesEntertainment reporter Damon, the star of the Bourne franchise, was originally going to direct and star in the film, which is nominated for five Golden Globe awards. But scheduling meant he had to pull out of both roles, remaining as a producer. Affleck believes that ""there aren't many parts like this"". And that's even for male actors at the height of their career. ""It's so exhilarating and fun to get a part like this,"" he explains. ""You get to do what you thought you'd do when you first started being an actor. The reality is, you end up doing so much stuff you thought you'd never have to do, and would never want to do again."" Affleck plays Boston janitor Lee, who, having suffered painful tragedy in his own life, has to return to his home town of Manchester by the Sea to take care of his teenage nephew, following the death of his brother. The film was written and directed by Kenneth Lonergan, who was nominated for an Oscar for his writing on Martin Scorsese's Gangs of New York. ""The truth is there's so much media out there, so much TV, and there's a lot of material written for comedies and dramas, but there are very few things that have been brewing for years in the way Kenny writes things,"" the actor claims. ""It's the antithesis of what our culture has come to be, I mean our Western pop culture of churning it out and gobbling it up. There are also a lot of great actors out there, and sometimes those scripts go to other people. I got lucky."" Affleck, who was nominated for an Oscar in 2008 for his role in The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, grew up in the Massachusetts area where the film is set, along with his brother Ben and neighbour, Matt Damon. Affleck says he was ""aware of the project for some time"" and knew Damon was working on it. ""When they asked me to do the part I said, 'Sure, that might mean we never get it made, but I'm honoured that you asked.' It was very clear to me that it was the kind of movie I would love even if no-one else did."" Glowing reviews However, not only did the film receive glowing reviews after its debut at the Sundance Film Festival last year, but Affleck is the favourite to receive the Globe for best actor in a drama. The film is also nominated for best screenplay, best director, best motion picture drama, and his co-star Michelle Williams is up for best supporting actress. She plays Affleck's ex-wife, and confesses that she ""burst into tears"" when she got the role. ""I'd wanted to work with Kenny for so long,"" she says. ""Casey and I had actually read for a play with him years ago. I was pregnant with my daughter at the time. Just knowing that it was finally going to happen, that we were all going to work together - I got a little tearful, yes. ""It felt like a momentous occasion when you want something and it comes true, even when you have to wait a long time. ""Casey and Kenny are good men and more than anything I am really happy to see their toil and efforts come good at this end because they deserve it. Casey looked like he carried the weight of the world on his shoulders when we were making it."" The drama is a study in grief, and how the three main characters, played by Williams, Affleck and Lucas Hedges as Lee's nephew Patrick, deal with their losses. Affleck agrees that ""there were bright spots in the experience"" and ""a lot of light in the film"", but admits it was a ""demanding role"". ""Talking about acting sounds so precious and pretentious, it's almost unbearable, but there was a lot required emotionally - showing up there, and being able to be very upset and sad and tortured, yet contain it all, and keep it tight."" Kenneth Lonergan has received critical praise for not providing a so-called ""Hollywood answer"" to suffering, calling such stories ""dishonest fantasies"". ""Nobody needs me to tell anyone that real life can be difficult enough without watching something that tells you that everything will be OK, and in time you will understand about the circle of life and all this palaver,"" he says. ""But to see my own experience reflected back at me helps me and makes me feel less alone. The sentimental approach which is so common is a cheat."" However, Michelle Williams believes that Manchester by the Sea does offer ""a glimmer of hope"" in its portrayal of bereavement. ""I think ultimately one of the things the movie is about is endurance. After hard times, you have to find ways to cleave to life and to people, even when you feel there isn't any hope. There's always a glimmer, I think that's what the movie offers, a glimmer of hope."" Manchester by the Sea is released in the UK on 13 January. The Golden Globes take place on 8 January.

"By Tim MastersEntertainment and arts correspondent, BBC News In his dressing room at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, Douglas Hodge is flicking through a giant scrapbook. On each page, a famous face: Charlie Chaplin... Salvador Dali... Fred Astaire... David Bowie... Mick Jagger... Prince... Michael Jackson. There's even Thom Yorke from Radiohead. ""It's the way he dances,"" explains Hodge. ""He's so tiny and bird-like."" As soon as he knew he had got the role of Willy Wonka, Hodge began collecting pictures of people who might inspire him. As he turns the pages, he pauses at a 1980s photo of David Bowie from his Let's Dance period. ""Bowie has been in my mind as someone who disappeared from the public for a long time and then emerged. A strange exotic creature - he seems to inherit a tradition of enigma and exclusiveness."" From another page stares French writer Marcel Proust. Proust? ""He was allergic to almost everything he touched and he hardly ever went out of his home."" Hodge closes the scrapbook, and adds: ""They are spurs really, and then you have to forget them all."" The Charlie and the Chocolate Factory musical, based on Roald Dahl's book and directed by Sam Mendes, officially opens on Tuesday night after a month of previews. The show is one of the most eagerly anticipated in the West End this year, and comes hot on the heels of another musical Dahl adaptation, Matilda, which scooped awards galore and transferred to Broadway. It is Mendes' first project since directing Skyfall, the most successful James Bond film of all time. ""There are so many departments on this show like music, choreography, design and costume - you need someone who's made those big movies to oversee all these collaborations,"" says Hodge. The 53-year-old actor says the single biggest joy has been working with Mendes on ""making something from the ground up"". The huge technical requirements of the show have meant a fair amount of what Hodge describes as ""fiddling and finessing"" during the preview period. The first scheduled performances in May were delayed due to problems with the delivery of a piece of stage equipment. ""When you're making anything brand new you have to factor that in,"" says Hodge. ""Essentially what's happened since the first preview is the Great Glass Elevator has come into the production and I now have a vanishing trick. It's a terribly technical thing, but we wanted to get the story on stage and then keep working on the other things."" When Hodge's casting was announced last autumn he was playing another larger-than-life figure, Cyrano de Bergerac, on Broadway. His next job was perfect preparation for Willy Wonka: reading the audio books of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and its sequel Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator. Hodge never read the books as a child. ""I was talking to my mum about it,"" he laughs. ""She thought they were too scary. I actually read his darker things, the Tales of the Unexpected, when I was an adult. ""But it wasn't really part of childhood at all in the way that it was of Sam's or most of the people in the cast. They've grown up on it."" How easily did he distance himself from the big-screen versions of Willy Wonka played by Gene Wilder and Johnny Depp? ""It's a skill that you develop as soon as you become a Shakespearean actor. All my career I've stepped into Hamlet or Romeo or Coriolanus or Titus Andronicus. ""I think the Gene Wilder performance is quite brilliant, but it is filmic. It's a sort of transcendental, druggy laid-back thing that you can't do in a 2,500-seat theatre in a musical."" Hodge begins to laugh. ""I said to someone the other day, I think I look too much like Johnny Depp. Which is not something I thought I would have a reason to say in my life - ever!"" Hodge describes his take on Wonka as ""quintessentially English"". ""He's a brilliant, almost autistic, genius inventor: reclusive, separate and an innocent child. He relates far better to children than he does to adults."" We get onto the subject of Jimmy Savile. Had there been discussions about how to play the role of Willy Wonka in the post-Savile era? ""I don't think that element exists at all in this story,"" says Hodge. ""There's a lack of sexuality about the whole Willy Wonka world which is to do with sweets and toys and imagination and innocence. It would be a real shame if that did impinge on it. ""It's something you have to consider but hopefully it's all honest and true. You instinctively know what's appropriate."" Douglas Hodge's career has embraced stage, TV and film work as well as directing and composing. Nominated for an Olivier Award four times, he won in 2009 for his role in La Cage Aux Folles. A year later he won the Tony, Drama Desk and Outer Critics Circle Awards for the same role. On the big screen, the actor has starred alongside Reese Witherspoon in Vanity Fair and Russell Crowe in Robin Hood. Later this year he will be seen as Paul Burrell in the Diana, Princess of Wales biopic starring Naomi Watts. He has completed work on his own musical, Meantime, a love story set in Heathrow Airport. ""I'll worry about that when we get this juggernaut on the road, but I'd love it to come to life,"" he says. For the moment, Hodge has other matters to attend to - such as learning to roller skate for Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. ""It's nearly killed me. But we haven't put the roller skating in the show yet. ""We just had this idea half way through - and off I went for roller skating lessons every morning. ""I can show you the bruises. But it may be that it's not right. It may be just gilding the lily.""

"Mr Thompson told staff on Thursday that the £400m saving was necessary so that a ""reinvestment"" pool could be established. The BBC had previously announced it would have to cut its budget by 16% in order to meet the cost of the recent licence fee deal. It was agreed that the annual licence fee would be frozen until 2017. ""I believe we need the ability to reinvest as well. Sometimes to boost quality we need more money in certain parts of the BBC,"" Mr Thompson said. The cutbacks have also been made so the BBC can afford to pay for some other conditions of the license fee deal, such as funding of the World Service and BBC Monitoring. He said reinvesting the money saved would ""boost quality and editorial ambition and respond to new developments in the media"". He also ruled out closing any services or channels, saying ""the British public love the services they get. You say you want to close a service and its audience doubles"". Mr Thompson has asked staff to suggest ways they think the savings could be made. However the National Union of Journalists has condemned the additional cuts saying it will ""actively resist"" them.",BBC Director General Mark Thompson has said he is increasing the target for cuts by 4% over the next four years.

After 53 years in London, the show is among those to have moved in order to boost the BBC's presence in the north. Blue Peter will get a new garden on a roof of the MediaCityUK studio complex. Tim Levell, the show's editor, said the programme's purpose would remain the same but that the move was a chance to refresh it. ""Underlying everything, Blue Peter has the same values,"" he said. ""We are about telling younger viewers about things that are interesting to them - that's always been the same. The wrapping is slightly different but the present inside is still the same.""

They include Deadly 60 presenter Steve Backshall, who will present wildlife slots, and The Apprentice runner-up Saira Khan, who will instruct children how to make money for the Blue Peter appeal. The new roof garden will feature items from the old garden, such as a ship sculpture and a statue of the beloved Blue Peter dog Petra. But it has not yet been landscaped and will not be seen on screen for some time. Levell also confirmed that the Blue Peter annual would not be in shops in 2011.

The latest legal cases allege multiple sexual offences against four women, who currently reside in Tennessee, New York, Ecuador and Hungary. Some of the attacks allegedly took place after meetings with Weinstein at the Cannes and Venice Film Festivals. The new allegations include: Allegations against Weinstein began to emerge in October 2017, when The New York Times first reported incidents dating back decades. At least 80 women have since accused him of sexual misconduct, including actresses Gwyneth Paltrow, Uma Thurman and Salma Hayek. The allegations were at the centre of the #MeToo movement that inspired women to go public with misconduct allegations against powerful men.

In what is her first TV interview, Farrow says she is ""hurt"" and ""angry"". The 32-year-old has repeatedly accused Allen of molesting her when she was seven - claims the director has always denied. Farrow expressed anger at the suggestion she was simply caught up in the Hollywood #metoo campaign, saying: ""Why shouldn't I want to bring him down? Why shouldn't I be angry? Why shouldn't I be hurt? ""Why shouldn't I feel some sort of outrage... after all these years of being ignored, disbelieved and tossed aside?"" The excerpt, in which Farrow was visibly emotional, was a preview of a longer interview, which will be aired on Thursday. The interview was filmed on Monday at Farrow's home in Bridgewater, Connecticut. Farrow discussed why it was the right time for her to do a television interview after years of claiming Allen had abused her. ""All I can do is speak my truth and hope - hope that somebody will believe me rather than just hearing,"" she said. 'Fabrication' claim Allen was investigated over a 1992 claim by Farrow that he sexually assaulted her at the family's Connecticut home. Prosecutors did not charge the film-maker and he has always denied the allegations, which he claims had been fabricated by his former partner Mia Farrow. In 2014, Dylan Farrow wrote an open letter alleging she had been molested by Allen - but he responded to the claims calling them ""untrue and disgraceful"". More recently, in a series of tweets posted ahead of last week's Golden Globes award ceremony, Dylan Farrow reiterated her claims that Allen was a ""predator"". A number of actors have distanced themselves from Allen as Hollywood's sexual harassment scandal continues. They include Timothee Chalamet, who announced this week he will give his salary for appearing in Allen's next film, A Rainy Day in New York, to charity. Chalamet claimed: ""I don't want to profit from my work on the film."" His co-star, Rebecca Hall, also donated her fee to charity and said she ""regretted"" her decision to appear in the film.

Sykes found fame in a series of TV sitcoms from the 1950s, including Sykes And A... alongside Hattie Jacques. Sir Bruce Forsyth paid tribute to the star, calling him ""one of the greats of comedy in this country"". ""He was universally loved here,"" the entertainer continued. ""He was just one of the funniest men ever."" Comedian Stephen Fry wrote on Twitter: ""Oh no! Eric Sykes gone? An adorable, brilliant, modest, hilarious, innovative and irreplaceable comic master. Farewell, dear, dear man."" League of Gentlemen star Mark Gatiss said: ""The wonderful Eric Sykes has left us. A giant of comedy and a gentleman - funny to his very core. RIP."" Comic Robin Ince paid tribute to ""the last link to many of the most important early post war comedians"" and ""a great entertainer"". Born in Oldham, Sykes started his career writing radio material for comedians including Frankie Howerd, Tony Hancock and The Goon Show. He stepped into the spotlight with his own TV shows including Dress Rehearsal in 1956, Sykes And A... in 1960 and a follow-up, simply titled Sykes, in 1972. In the latter two, he and Jacques developed a popular partnership as a bumbling brother and long-suffering sister living at Sebastopol Terrace. Another of Sykes' best-known productions was in a virtually silent slapstick film called The Plank. The 1967 short saw him and Tommy Cooper play accident-prone workmen and is regarded as a landmark of visual comedy. Sykes also appeared in the controversial 1969 sitcom Curry and Chips alongside longtime writing partner Spike Milligan, who was blacked up to play an Irish-Pakistani factory worker. Sykes' television roles dried up after a sitcom set in a golf club, The Nineteenth Hole, made for ITV in 1989. But his career was far from quiet. He had appeared in a string of supporting roles on the big screen over the years and continued his film work with The Others, alongside Nicole Kidman, and as caretaker Frank Bryce in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. He also enjoyed renewed acclaim on stage, appearing in plays by the likes of Ray Cooney, Moliere and Alan Bennett. That came despite struggling with hearing loss for most of his life, as well as gradual eye failure, which left him almost deaf and blind by the 1990s. Former BBC head of comedy Jon Plowman paid tribute to Sykes as ""a warm man, a kind man, a warm family man"". ""We won't see his like again,"" he said. ""He was a wonderful improviser. ""His genius was both as a scriptwriter but also someone who could do stuff off the cuff. He was classless and funny and warm."" Sykes was made an OBE in 1986 before being elevated to a CBE in 2004. In 1992, he received lifetime achievement honours from the Writers' Guild and the British Comedy Awards. Sykes and wife Edith celebrated their 60th wedding anniversary this Valentine's Day. The couple had one son and three daughters.","Eric Sykes, one of Britain's best-loved comedy actors and writers, has died at the age of 89, his manager has said."
"Amy, directed by Asif Kapadia, was named best documentary at the European Film Awards. The film was condemned by her father Mitch Winehouse for painting the singer's family in a negative light. Best European film went to Youth while British actress Charlotte Rampling was given a lifetime achievement. Rampling also won best actress for her role in the British drama 45 Years at the event in Berlin on Saturday night. Veteran actor Michael Caine received two trophies - he was presented with an honorary award and was also named best actor for Youth. He said: ""It's been 50 years and I've never won an award in Europe. And now I've won two in one evening. It's so strange because I (usually) sit in these audiences and just clap someone else.""

"Oscar-winning writer Tom Stoppard will pen the script and Atonement film-maker Joe Wright will direct the epic romance, based on Leo Tolstoy's novel. Knightley will play Anna, a married woman who has an affair with a younger soldier. Law has landed the role of her husband, Aleksei Karenin. The film, which casts Aaron Johnson as Count Vronsky, is due out next year. Anna Karenina will be Knightley's third collaboration with Wright. She starred in his 2005 film Pride And Prejudice, followed by the Academy Award-winning movie Atonement two years later. The Working Title production will begin filming in the UK and Russia this month. ""We anticipate that this will be a defining screen version of Anna Karenina,"" said Tim Bevan, of Working Title Films. James Schamus, from Focus Features - who will distribute the film, said: ""Joe Wright is a master film-maker, and with Tom Stoppard's brilliant screenplay this Anna Karenina will be full of both pageantry and emotion."" Powerful tale Set in late 19th-century Russia, Anna Karenina is described as a powerful tale that ""explores the capacity for love that surges through the human heart, from the passion between adulterers to the bond between a mother and her children"". There have been several film versions of Tolstoy's classic novel, including adaptations starring Vivien Leigh (1948) and Greta Garbo (1935). In 1997, it was remade with French actress Sophie Marceau and Britain's Sean Bean, as Anna's lover Vronsky.

"Superior Court Judge Mark Young annulled credits that Lohan received for time she spent in London in 2014. The 28-year-old was originally ordered to complete 240 hours of community service as part of a 2013 plea deal. It stemmed from a 2012 case involving reckless driving and lying to police. The actress, who made her West End debut last year in a production of David Mamet's Speed-the-Plow, was not present for Wednesday's hearing. The Mean Girls star worked with charity group Community Service Volunteers (CSV) during her time in London and reportedly lobbied US insurance giant Esurance to donate $10,000 (£6,440) to the organisation. A statement from CSV said she had volunteered on the organisation's Positive Futures project, which works with teenagers in Hackney. ""She has built strong relationships with the young volunteers she has worked with on the scheme,"" CSV said. Yet US prosecutors questioned some of her UK activities - which reportedly included ""meeting and greeting"" fans in London - and challenged evidence submitted by her attorney to show the required hours had been completed. A hearing has been scheduled for 12 March, when a new community service agency will be selected. She will have until 28 May to complete the additional community service.",A Los Angeles judge has told Lindsay Lohan to do 125 more hours of community service after decreeing that activities she performed while appearing in a West End play last year did not count.
"By Tim MastersArts and entertainment correspondent, BBC News ""War is hell,"" said Pitt, who plays a Sherman tank commander on a mission behind enemy lines in 1945. He said the film ""was about the accumulative psychic trauma that every soldier carries to some extent."" The London showing was the European premiere of the film, which is released in the UK on Wednesday. Speaking on the red carpet, Pitt told the BBC News website: ""The film follows a tank crew - which hasn't really been dissected before to this kind of detail."" Pitt and co-stars Shia LaBeouf, Logan Lerman, Michael Pena and Jon Bernthal were greeted by hundreds of cheering fans in Leicester Square. They were also joined by World War Two ex-tank crewman Peter Comfort, 90, who had worked as an adviser on Fury. Bernthal said: ""This movie is family drama. It's about a family travelling through hell in a metal box."" Earlier, Pitt told a press conference that he hoped soldiers would feel ""respectfully recognised"" by what the film showed. ""It is an amazing fact of human nature that one year we can be chopping each other up [and] the next we can be sharing a pint. We continually devolve into conflict, no matter how much we evolve."" The 50-year-old was working on Fury at the same time his wife Angelina Jolie was directing her forthcoming WWII film Unbroken, which stars Jack O'Connell as an Olympic athlete taken prisoner by Japanese forces. ""It was a lovely experience; we don't normally work at the same time,"" said Pitt, who previously played a soldier in Quentin Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds. ""I was studying the European theatre [of war]; she was studying the Pacific theatre. I was studying tanks; she was studying bombers."" Fury's director, David Ayer, said it was a ""privilege"" to close the BFI London Film Festival with a film shot in the UK - specifically around Oxfordshire and at Bovingdon Airfield in Hertfordshire. ""It brings great closure to the process,"" he said. ""One year ago to the day, we were shooting some of those very battle scenes."" According to the director, Pitt would often stay inside the tank during breaks on set. ""There's nothing ergonomical about a tank,"" Pitt admitted. ""You were always getting banged up on something. ""But we were forced to familiarise ourselves with the tank and we all found our little comfort spots. I became quite proprietorial about it."" The London Film Festival opened on 8 October with another WWII film, The Imitation Game, about codebreaker Alan Turing. Festival Director Clare Stewart said this year's festival had a record audience turnout of 163,300, a 7.5% increase on last year. Sunday's gala screening followed an awards event on Saturday at which director Stephen Frears was honoured with a British Film Institute fellowship.",Brad Pitt said he hoped his new film Fury recognised the trauma suffered by soldiers in World War Two as it closed this year's BFI London Film Festival.
"She was best known for appearing in a string of horror films in the 1950s and '60s, including Dracula: Prince of Darkness alongside Christopher Lee. Her agent, Thomas Bowington, said she was ""quietly evil"" on screen. ""She really was Hammer's number one leading lady and the technicolour queen of Hammer,"" he told the PA news agency. ""On screen she could be quietly evil. She goes from statuesque beauty to just animalistic wildness. ""She was a regular favourite of Hammer events and autograph shows but also performed on stage with the RSC [Royal Shakespeare Company]."" Born Barbra Kowin in London in 1932, Shelley started out as a model before beginning her film career in Italy in the mid-1950s. This led to the London-based Hammer Film Productions giving her roles in such gothic horror features as Blood of the Vampire, The Gorgon and Rasputin: The Mad Monk. Shelley later appeared in the Doctor Who adventure Planet of Fire, alongside Peter Davison's Doctor. Nicola Bryant, who played the Doctor's companion Peri, remembered her on Twitter as ""a darling person and a talented actress"". ""When we worked together on Planet of Fire she was so kind to me,"" she wrote. ""She gave me a little owl, still in my possession, and some good advice."" Shelley's other TV roles included appearances in The Saint, The Avengers and EastEnders, in which she she played Hester Samuels. Scream queen Although she was known as a scream queen, Shelley's most famous scream - in the aforementioned Dracula film - was in fact dubbed by co-star Suzan Farmer. Speaking to the Daily Express in 2009, she described Hammer as being like ""a very talented family"" that gave its stars access to ""a wonderful canteen"". ""To work with Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee... I've been more than lucky, I've been honoured,"" Shelley went on. ""They were so wonderful to work with, both so generous as actors with a wonderful atmosphere on the set and a wonderful sense of humour. ""When we were working, especially with Chris, who's got a great sense of humour, we used to have jokes before and after shooting,"" she continued. ""Like in Dracula: Prince Of Darkness, where he comes down the stairs hissing. Suzan Farmer and I used to look up and sing 'The Boy I Love Is Up In The Gallery'.""

"The journalist and author is receiving the award to recognise her contribution to television and the arts. The fellowship is given out every year with past recipients including Dawn French, Michael Palin and Jon Snow. Adie said: ""It's lovely to be awarded the Bafta Fellowship. I feel very honoured."" Jane Lush, Chair of Bafta, said: ""Kate Adie is a truly ground-breaking news journalist, being one of a very small number of women working to report the news from hostile environments around the world. ""We are delighted to be celebrating her stellar career at this year's ceremony; she is a true trailblazer and very deserving of the Fellowship Award."" Adie started her career working in local radio at Radio Durham and then BBC Radio Bristol. She then moved on to TV news in London and her live report in 1980, marking the end of the siege of the Iranian Embassy, was viewed by millions after it interrupted the World Snooker Championships. Adie became chief news correspondent for the BBC in 1989, holding the post for 14 years and saw her reporting from conflicts around the world, including both Gulf Wars and war in the Balkans. Adie also memorably covered the uprising of Chinese students in Tianenmen Square. She was the only correspondent to report from the streets of Beijing on the gunfire and violence as hundreds were massacred in the 1989 events. She later said she felt duty bound to stay - despite the risk to her - and her cameraman's - personal safety. In an interview with the Daily Telegraph nearly ten years ago, she said: ""I felt it hugely that night, more so than I would normally feel. ""It was partly because we had seen only one other cameraman. The second thing was that we knew that within China the habit would be that they would rewrite history or possibly deny it. So we knew we had to get some evidence.' It was to be one of the most important and distressing reports Adie filed during her years at the BBC. The 72-year-old now presents Radio 4's From Our Own Correspondent and is a contributor to many other radio and television programmes.

"By Mark SavageBBC Music reporter The BBC looked at 30 of the ""best of 2017"" lists in music's most influential publications - including the NME, Rolling Stone, Vice, Billboard and Q Magazine - to find the highest-ranked albums of the year. Read about the Top 10, and what the critics had to say about each of them, below. 10) Kelela - Take Me Apart Kelela Mizanekristos' ambition for her debut album was to discover ""the place between Bjork, Sade, and Beyonce"". It's a goal she achieves - the shape-shifting R&B of Take Me Apart is both familiar and challenging, as the 34-year-old deconstructs the emotional mechanics of a break-up, from devastation through recrimination to the blossoming of a new love. 9) Sampha - Process A sonically adventurous patchwork of analogue and digital soul, Process was written as London-born singer Sampha Sisay processed the grief from his mother's death. His anguish is palpable throughout - and nowhere is it more moving than on (No One Knows Me) Like The Piano, where he reminisces about the keyboard she taught him to play as a five year-old. 8) Perfume Genius - No Shape Tortured soul Mike Hadreas started his recording career as Perfume Genius in 2010, recording candid ballads about growing up gay, isolated, confused and bullied. No Shape lets the light in. Full of lavish, rococo string arrangements and buoyant melodies, it finds the singer shedding his anxieties and settling down. ""Did you notice, we sleep through the night?"" he sings on Alan - a song dedicated to his lover, Alan Wyffels. 7) Jay-Z - 4:44 In which Jay-Z did something no-one expected: He apologised. A partial response to Beyonce's rage on Lemonade, it finds the star as vulnerable and introspective, as he candidly confronts his infidelity. Elsewhere, he dispenses financial advice and makes repeated calls on black American culture to do more to support black Americans. Clocking in at a brisk 36 minutes, it's still his most complete, most satisfying album in years. 6) The War On Drugs - A Deeper Understanding After 2014's Lost In A Dream became a surprise hit, Philadelphia's War On Drugs were signed to Atlantic Records - but their first album for the label shows no signs of compromise. The first single, Thinking Of A Place, stretches out over 11 minutes, with ambient synths and echo-drenched guitars drifting in and out of view like the lover who ""vanished in the night"" in Adam Granduciel's lyrics. But as big as the songs get, there's always a ear-catching detail or haunting melody to draw you in. 5) LCD Soundsystem - American Dream We have David Bowie to thank for this one. LCD Soundsystem made an emphatic goodbye in 2011, but when frontman James Murphy played percussion on Bowie's Blackstar, the musician persuaded him to do things that ""make you uncomfortable"". The result is American Dream, which steers the band's itchy disco straight into the political turmoil of 2017. As Murphy sings on Call The Police: ""The old guys are frightened / And frightening to behold."" 4) St Vincent - Masseduction ""It's an incredibly sad album,"" St Vincent told the BBC of her fifth album, Masseduction. ""Quite manic and painful."" It's also her most accomplished - all seedy glamour, giddy highs and unsettling lows. The centrepiece is New York, a subterranean ballad that's either about her breakup with supermodel Cara Delevigne or the death of David Bowie (or neither or both). St Vincent hired Taylor Swift's producer Jack Antonoff to work on the album, but he never reduces her to a pop caricature - she's by turns alluring, imperious, vulnerable, playful and, yes, incredibly sad. 3) Lorde - Melodrama Lorde beat the second album curse with poetic lyrics and a flair for darkness. Melodrama depicts the messy, awkward business of growing up with an author's eye for detail (""I overthink your punctuation use,"" she tells her lover on The Louvre). The music reflects the turbulence of her love life, soaring and plunging with gut-churning regularity - with the self-lacerating Liability the undoubted highlight. 2) SZA - CTRL Record company politics nearly derailed SZA's album - and the singer (otherwise known as Solana Rowe) briefly threatened to quit music altogether - but wiser heads prevailed, and CTRL finally saw the light of day in June. Her debut is a frank and fascinating insight into the complexities of modern love; of how desire, competition, jealousy, sexual politics, social media and low self-esteem can derail a relationship. The singer deliberately turned down the reverb and echo on her vocals, giving the album an intimate, confessional tone that's made it a touchstone for fans and fellow musicians alike. 1) Kendrick Lamar - Damn Kendrick Lamar made a 180-degree turn from the progressive jazz funk of 2015's To Pimp A Butterfly, to deliver this skeletal, powerful rap sermon. The song titles, delivered ALL IN CAPS, reference the deadly sins Pride and Lust, as well as Lamar's post-fame struggles with Loyalty and remaining Humble. But it's the weight and dexterity of his lyrics that set the album apart - examining America's political turmoil through the prism of his own contradictions and failings.

"By Tim MastersArts and entertainment correspondent The BFI figures, revealed on Thursday, looked at the representation of black actors in more than 1,000 UK films over the last decade. The study found that the number of UK films with roles for black actors had seen little change over that time. It also showed 59 percent of UK films made in the last 10 years have featured no black actors in lead or named roles. Kidulthood star Clarke is followed in the list by Ashley Walters, Naomie Harris and Thandie Newton. The data was presented at the London Film Festival's Black Star Symposium, at which British actor David Oyelowo issued a plea for a more diverse industry. ""We will only get to the point when I don't have to give these talks about diversity if we actually start to do diversity,"" he told an audience of industry figures at BFI Southbank. ""The only way that's going to happen is if the demographic of the decision makers changes."" Other findings in the BFI research included: ""Whilst we feel from what we see on screen that most UK films do not cast black actors in them, and that black actors are playing the same types of roles over and again, we now have the data to support this,"" said BFI creative director Heather Stewart, who presented the research. ""The number of lead roles for black actors has not really changed over 10 years and the types of films in which they have had leading roles suggests stereotyping,"" she added. ""Colour-blind casting across genres does not really exist on the big screen, ultimately limiting representation. ""Diversity is one of the biggest issues facing film - audiences want to see the world in which we live reflected back at them."" British black actors with the most leading roles in UK films since 2006 The BFI research looked at 1,172 UK films made and released between January 2006 and August 2016. Of those, 691 films - 59 percent - did not feature any black actors in either lead or named roles. The proportion of UK films which credited at least one black actor in a lead role was 13% - 157 films in all. According to the BFI, one of the most significant observations from the research was the ""clustering"" of lead roles for black actors within a relatively small number of films. More than half of all leading roles for black actors are in 47 films, which means that less than five percent have cast a black actor in a lead or named role at all. UK films with the most roles for black actors since 2006 Only 15 black actors, five of whom are women, have played two or more lead roles in UK films since 2006. Noel Clarke's eight leading roles in UK films - such as Adulthood, The Anomaly and Brotherhood, all of which he directed - puts him at the top of the rankings. Walters follows with seven roles, then Harris with six. Newton follows with five, followed by Idris Elba with four and Chiwetel Ejiofor with three. 'Stop this talent drain' Oyelowo, whose films A United Kingdom and Queen of Katwe feature at this year's festival, said that his ""heart dies a little"" whenever he is asked to talk about diversity in interviews. The actor, whose other films include Selma, Lincoln and Jack Reacher, said he had moved to Los Angeles because of the lack of opportunity in the UK. ""Please stop this talent drain,"" he implored industry bosses. ""You have to change the demographics of the people who are making these decisions. ""You are the curators of culture. You are those who are going to shape the minds of those coming up. ""If I'd seen a film like A United Kingdom when I was leaving drama school, I don't think I would be living in America now.""

But she rubbished those suggestions, adding: ""It can often feel counter cultural and selfish to focus on oneself but until you love yourself then you can't really go out and be the full energetic giving and loving you.

"By Tim MastersEntertainment and arts correspondent, BBC News Compiled in the 1970s, the book contains their favourite sentences clipped from the unedited manuscripts of romantic novels. Many are unintentional innuendos that tickled the editors at the time, though they might seem tame to the Fifty Shades of Grey generation. Others are just toe-curlingly bad. To mark Valentine's Day, the University of Reading has given a peek into the so-called ""Anthology of Artless Extracts"", part of its Mills & Boon archive. The A5 notebook contains such gems as: He paused and then added more softly, 'Come on Elaine, it won't be the first time we have doubled up on a bicycle.' (Flora Kidd, Dangerous Pretence) and 'My darling, help me grope back to your white ways,' he said, his voice hoarse with emotion. 'You won't have to grope. You got there last night...' (Louise Gerard, The Sultan's Slave) and Mrs White... heaved at something under the blankets and produced a pineapple. (Betty Neels, Pineapple Girl) Judith Watts, a PhD researcher at the university and author of erotic fiction, says the notebook - and letters in the archive - reveal much about the relationship between writers, their readers and the publisher. ""They show the importance of women writers earning their living, the desire of the reader to get their next romantic fix, and the publisher's need to stay in business,"" she says. ""The authors were trying the reflect the times, but they were very limited about what they could say about sex and desire. ""A lot's been said about things stopping at the bedroom door. As some of these snippets show - they didn't. There was pre-marital sex and affairs, but it was all couched in innuendo and euphemism."" Steamy sentences The Mills and Boon catalogue shows the changing nature of the romantic novel over the decades. Themes of class and wealth in the 1920s gave way to wartime concerns in the 30s and 40s. In the 1950s the woman was often a widow and a mother, while the 60s brought an influx of glamorous career women. More stories were set abroad and the romantic encounters became more sexual. 30 questions Another insight into the pressures on authors to keep in touch with their readers is seen in a letter and questionnaire from novelist Violet Winspear in 1973. Winspear became Mills & Boon's top-selling writer and shocked the older readers with her erotic tales. In 20 years, she wrote 37 titles, most of which were set abroad. Among the 30 questions she asked Mills and Boon bosses were: Are love scenes too tame? Are virtuous heroines out of date? Are bedroom doors to be flung open. Are bedroom doors to be left ajar? Are bedroom doors to be firmly closed? In her accompanying letter Winspear wrote: ""I don't think even publishers realise how far removed from public opinion an author often feels... if you can spare the time to run through my questionnaire and give me a sort of guide to M&B's present-day requirements, then it will be of great help to me in guiding my romances along the sticky road to good sales or that remainder shelf we all dread."" Says Ms Watts: ""Violet lived with her mother and her cat, but she had dreams and fantasies like everyone else. ""I think she was worried that times were changing. She used to write her romances with the bluff hero and the virtuous girl. ""There are lots of letters in the archive discussing how far you can go."" She adds: ""I had a nana who, when I went to the library, ordered her Mills and Boon and would ask for 'two doctors and a sheikh'. They were marketed like that.""

"By Sarah Jane GriffithsEntertainment reporter, BBC News More than 32,000 people attend the theatre in central London every night, according to the Society of London Theatre (Solt), which represents the producers, theatre owners and managers of 52 venues. It said all of them undergo ""rigorous safety checks and inspections"", and both Solt and The Theatres Trust have today rushed to assure theatre-goers that occurrences such as that at the Apollo are ""extremely rare"". The Stage critic Mark Shenton, who often posts pictures online of theatres in disrepair, told the BBC he believed ""the state of some West End theatres beggars belief"". But Mhora Samuel, director of The Theatres Trust, which looks after buildings across the whole of the UK, said: ""The public should be reassured that theatre owners carry out regular plasterwork inspections and maintenance regimes to ensure the safety of their buildings."" The Trust told the BBC that all theatres have what is known as a ceiling certificate, with all inspections ""certified by independent experts"". Solt also confirmed at a meeting with all of the city's major theatre owners on the morning after the accident that all of their safety inspections and certificates are up to date. It added that the capital's theatres all took ""the safety of their audience, performers and staff very seriously"". The majority are Victorian buildings, including the Apollo, which dates back to 1901 and is Grade II listed. 'Lack of investment' While there have been reassurances that this accident was a one-off, there have been several incidents where the structure of a theatre has been an issue. In September, plaster fell on the stage at the Aldwych Theatre during a performance of the musical Top Hat. No-one was hit but the matinee was halted and subsequently abandoned. The Royal Court received an emergency £300,000 grant from the Arts Council last year for ""immediate and unexpected repairs"". And in 2011 the Comedy Theatre - now the Harold Pinter Theatre - cancelled a performance of The Children's Hour starring Keira Knightley at short notice for ""essential building repairs"". Back in 2004, 15 people were injured when plaster fell from the ceiling of the Theatre Royal Haymarket. Also in 2004, Andrew Lloyd Webber, who at the time owned the Apollo, suggested in the House of Lords that some of London's listed theatres should be demolished rather than restored. At the Old Vic, meanwhile, a major refurbishment is planned, one of the objectives being to repair a historic leak in the roof. The Sunday Telegraph's theatre critic Tim Walker believes that there has been ""under-investment"" in London theatres. ""I've been in theatres and you think, my goodness, they haven't even been in here with a Hoover for a long time. There is an element of neglect. They should be a lot more modern and a lot more user-friendly,"" said Walker. He added: ""According to the latest figures, the West End is making about half a billion pounds of profit a year. ""I think when profits get that big, you start to wonder whether or not they're actually spending the money on reinvesting in their theatres, which are very old."" 'Safe to attend' Westminster Council told the BBC that the investigation into what happened at the Apollo on Thursday ""will take some time"". Nicola Aiken, the council's cabinet member for community protection, told Radio 4's Today programme that district surveyors had ""declared that the ceiling structure is sound and only plaster fell"". She added that they had been carrying out checks on all historic theatres' consents and licensing ""because we want to reassure theatre-goers that theatres are safe to attend"". Shenton told the BBC he thought all West End theatres should have a new survey done ""immediately"" or face a ""fundamental lack of trust"" from audiences. ""I seriously don't think performances can go ahead until that happens,"" he said. However, the Society of London Theatre has confirmed that all venues, apart from the Apollo, will remain open for business. Performances of The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time have been cancelled up until 4 January 2014. The Apollo is situated at the heart of London's Theatreland on the north side of Shaftesbury Avenue, along with the Lyric, the Gielgud and the Queen's. The one-off Renaissance-style design was architect Lewen Sharp's only complete theatre. Since being built in 1901 it has only been altered in 1932 and 1991, according to The Theatre Trust's records. Restoration levy Brian Atwood, editor of The Stage, said that until the results of the investigation ""we should avoid simplistic assumptions that old theatre equals public danger"". He said the ""Apollo disaster needs action and reflection"" and that more money needed to be spent looking after West End theatres as ""preservation does warrant investment"". Mark Field, MP for Cities of London and Westminster, said there had already been ""a significant amount of investment in the fabric of many of central London's theatres in recent years"". But he added: ""Clearly quite a lot of Theatreland does go back 100 years or more. There's been a significant programme of renovation in the last 10 years, but given that we've got 40 or 50 theatres in the whole West End it clearly won't have applied to every one of them."" Many London theatres, including those run by the three big owners - the Apollo's owners Nimax, Andrew Lloyd Webber's Really Useful Group and Cameron Mackintosh's Delfont Mackintosh - include a £1.50 ""restoration levy"" in the ticket price that goes towards the venue's up-keep. However, critics such as Shenton have argued that there is a lack of transparency over how it is spent. He is in favour of ""a central body"" collecting and distributing the funds.","As investigators continue their work to establish what caused the ceiling to collapse at London's Apollo Theatre, theatre bosses and critics disagree on what shape West End theatres are really in."
"The acting pair are starring together in Samuel Beckett's Waiting for Godot and Harold Pinter's No Man's Land at the Cort Theatre. The New York Times called the plays ""absurdly enjoyable revivals"". However, the Financial Times suggested the theatrical knights were ""eclipsed"" by their US co-stars. Brendan Lemon, reviewing No Man's Land for the publication, said the routines between the pair ""now seem so worked-out they're stiff"", but conceded that ""my audience seemed plenty pleased by the play"". The Hollywood Reporter's David Rooney disagreed with this assessment, saying that ""both plays belong to Stewart and especially McKellen"". The New York Times' Ben Brantley said the revivals are ""an irresistible celebration of two actors' love affairs with their scripts,"" and praised Sir Ian's ""beautifully pained limp"" for his role as an existential down-and-out in Waiting for Godot. Appraising their performances in No Man's Land, he said: ""I will forever cherish the memory of Mr McKellen's nimble Spooner and Mr Stewart's increasingly paralytic Hirst doing their best to one-up each other, in authoritatively delivered nonsense."" Mark Kennedy, writing a review for the Associated Press, said the double helping offers ""two knights at their peerless best"", adding ""there can be no complaints about the service"". He called Sir Ian a ""wonder"" and McKellen a ""marvel"" for their roles in No Man's Land as hard-living men unlikely to bond - compared to Beckett's leads in Waiting for Godot who are inextricably linked to each other. The two actors, who star in the X-Men movies, are reprising their roles in Waiting for Godot which they performed on the West End stage in 2009. Their working relationship dates back to 1977 when they both appeared in Every Good Boy Deserves Favour by Sir Tom Stoppard. Sir Ian made his Broadway debut in 1967, with Sir Patrick appearing on the New York stage for the first time four years later, in a production of A Midsummer Night's Dream.",Sir Ian McKellen and Sir Patrick Stewart have received largely warm reviews for their double bill of stage works on Broadway.
"By Tim MastersEntertainment and Arts correspondent, BBC News It will be Leigh's first work at the NT since Two Thousand Years, which opened at the Cottesloe in September 2005. The new play's themes and characters will be developed during the rehearsal process. Leigh told the BBC: ""It's exactly like my films - when we get to the first night everyone will know what it is."" Manville is Leigh's most frequent collaborator, having worked with the director on films Secrets and Lies, High Hopes, Topsy-Turvy, All or Nothing and Vera Drake. In Leigh's current film Another Year, Manville plays Mary - a woman on a downward spiral of loneliness who seeks solace in drink and the company of her happily-married friends. The film has been included in Cannes, Toronto and London, and sees Leigh back with his regular family of actors, including Imelda Staunton and Peter Wight. Leigh had a best director nomination at this week's British Independent Film Awards, while Manville was nominated for best supporting actress. ""No premise"" The director had no script prepared and the characters were built from scratch during the early rehearsals. Manville confirmed that it would be the same process on the new play. ""As ever we don't know what it is. Like all his work you start with nothing,"" she said. ""The title comes last, character will start to come on day one of rehearsal, but there's no premise."" The play is set to open in the autumn in the Cottesloe. Manville told the BBC it would be her first time working on that particular stage. Manville's work at the National includes His Dark Materials, Pillars Of The Community and The Alchemist. Leigh's many stage plays include Babies Grow Old (RSC, 1974), Abigail's Party (Hampstead Theatre, 1977) and It's A Great Big Shame! (Theatre Royal, Stratford East, 1993).",Director Mike Leigh is to return to the National Theatre next year with an improvised play starring long-standing collaborator Lesley Manville.
"By Mark SavageBBC Music reporter Aretha Franklin has been awarded a special citation honouring ""her indelible contribution to American music and culture for more than five decades"". She becomes the 12th musician, and first female performer, to be given the citation - joining the likes of Bob Dylan, Scott Joplin and John Coltrane. Franklin died of pancreatic cancer last August, aged 76. During her career, the singer won 18 Grammys, had 17 top 10 US chart hits and became the first woman admitted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. An artist of immense versatility, her powerful voice, trained in the gospel tradition, moved on to embrace jazz, soul and rhythm and blues. Rolling Stone magazine rated her as the greatest singer of all time, thanks to songs like Respect, Chain Of Fools and (You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman. This year's Pulitzer Prize for music went to Ellen Reid's opera p r i s m [sic]. The Pulitzer jury described the piece as a ""bold new operatic work that uses sophisticated vocal writing and striking instrumental timbres to confront difficult subject matter: The effects of sexual and emotional abuse"". ""It feels unreal - like I'm going to wake up!"" said the Tennessee-born composer. She described her winning opera as challenging and personal, but said it was designed not to alienate the audience. ""There's something about the piece that makes people who haven't experienced sexual assault understand just a little bit more what it might be like,"" she told US radio station NPR. The Pulitzers also honour the best in literature, theatre, and journalism. Jackie Sibblies Drury won the drama prize for Fairview, a play which seems to be a black family comedy in the style of The Cosby Show or A Different World, but takes some unexpected turns, both for the characters onstage and the audience themselves. The Pulitzer jury called it ""a hard-hitting drama that examines race in a highly conceptual, layered structure, ultimately bringing audiences into the actors' community to face deep-seated prejudices"". Novelist Richard Powers won the fiction prize for The Overstory, a multi-narrative look at nine Americans who are brought together unfolding natural catastrophe; while David W Blight picked up the history prize for his acclaimed biography of Frederick Douglas, the escaped slave who became a leader of the abolitionist movement. The New York Times and Washington Post won journalism awards for their coverage of President Trump, while there was a special citation for the staff of the Capital Gazette, a paper in Maryland that suffered a deadly attack in its newsroom.

"Speaking outside Wimbledon Magistrates' Court, he said: ""I let myself down, I let a lot of people down. For that I'm truly sorry."" He also said he was ""thankful no-one was hurt"" in the three-car collision in Richmond, London, on 18 March. The court heard he had been more than twice the drink drive limit. In a letter read out in court, McPartlin also said he was ""ashamed and mortified"" and ""accepts full responsibility"" for what happened. The fine is thought to be one of the largest handed down in a British court for a drink driving offence. The mother of the Britain's Got Talent and Saturday Night Takeaway presenter was in the passenger seat of his Mini at the time of the collision, the court heard. In a witness statement, the driver of one of the cars said he and his wife ""could have died as a result of Mr McPartlin's reckless driving"". View from court: BBC entertainment correspondent Colin Paterson In court, Ant McPartlin - wearing a dark three-piece suit and black tie - looked down and slowly nodded a number of times as he heard that he was being fined and given a 20-month disqualification from driving. Extracts from a statement that he had given the police included the words ""ashamed"", ""mortified"", ""sorrow"" and ""regret"". There was no Dec to support him in court. This was Ant alone, behind the glass of a witness box - the furthest from his TV persona that he had ever been seen in public. Outside court there were more apologies from McPartlin in a prepared statement and then a hasty exit into a waiting people carrier as shouted questions, not unexpectedly, went unanswered. Britain's Got Talent's pre-recorded audition shows mean that he will still be on Saturday night TV for the next two months. But his brief emergence at the top of the steps at Wimbledon Magistrates' Court could be his last live appearance for a long time. The court heard McPartlin had 75 micrograms of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath when he was breathalysed - the legal limit is 35 micrograms per 100 millilitres of breath. District Judge Barbara Barnes described McPartlin as a ""well-known and successful entertainer"", taking his weekly income of about £130,000 into consideration when calculating the fine. Sentencing him, the district judge said: ""At the time when it happened you were struggling with various personal problems and also alcohol issues for some months. ""This incident happened, sadly, when it seems you suffered a brief relapse."" She described McPartlin's previous ""exemplary character"", adding: ""I think it will have quite an impact on you to know you're no longer a man of good character."" She added: ""Because of the seriousness of this offence, the financial pain must be imposed on you as on any other offender."" McPartlin's driving ban can be reduced by five months, to a total of 15 months, if he completes a drink-drive referral programme by mid-May 2019. Prosecutor Katie Sinnett-Jones told the court the incident happened at around 3.50pm on 18 March on Lower Richmond Road. She said McPartlin was driving around a ""sharp bend and lost control"" and then ended up on the wrong side of the road. He collided with another Mini car before driving ""straight into the front of an oncoming car"". McPartlin's vehicle ""came to a halt and was no longer driveable due to the damage caused"", she added. In a statement read to the court, the driver of the other Mini said: ""Myself and my family were in deep shock as we believed we could have died as a result of Mr McPartlin's reckless driving."" 'Sorrow and regret' McPartlin's barrister Liam Walker said his client has expressed both his ""sorrow and regret"" and knows the consequences could have been much worse. The presenter knows people in the public eye should provide a positive example to others and his court appearance is a ""turning point"" for him, the lawyer added. The Metropolitan Police previously said that a number of individuals were treated at the scene for minor injuries, and a child passenger from one of the cars was taken to hospital to be checked as a precaution. McPartlin's barrister said his client had been seeking help for ""alcohol and emotional issues"" at the time of the crash. He told the judge the incident was down to ""a brief relapse"" unbeknownst to McPartlin's mother. ""Anthony McPartlin is sorry and is doing everything he can to ensure this never happens again,"" Mr Walker said. ""He hopes that in time he can make himself better and that he might be forgiven by all of the many people he knows and he feels he has let down terribly."" After he was charged, his publicist confirmed McPartlin was taking time off from his TV commitments. He is currently seeking treatment. His presenting partner Declan Donnelly hosted the final two episodes of Saturday Night Takeaway alone and will also host Britain's Got Talent on his own, although McPartlin was seen on the ITV show over the weekend as the talent show aired its pre-recorded audition shows.

The London-born actor, who appeared in The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi, told followers: ""You're not entitled to politeness when your approach is rude. Even if you paid for a ticket!"" He later stressed that the vast majority of fans supported the cast and thanked them for ""putting yourselves in our shoes"", adding: ""You understand that there is a process, so much appreciated."" That prompted words of ""fatherly"" advice from Mark Hamill, AKA Luke Skywalker. ""Be careful there son - the last time I let a fan put themself in my shoes, they just took off running & sold them on Ebay,"" Hamill wrote.

"The decision was made by a judge at the Central Family Court in London on Tuesday. Armstrong had sought a divorce on the grounds of adultery. Judge Alun Jenkins granted the couple a decree nisi in under 30 seconds at the court. 42-year-old McPartlin confirmed the pair were splitting in January after 11 years of marriage. Court documents indicated the judge held that ""the respondent has committed adultery and that the petitioner finds it intolerable to live with the respondent."" McPartlin and 41-year-old Armstrong will now have to wait for a decree absolute - usually issued six weeks and one day following the granting of a decree nisi - to officially end the marriage. Hours after the divorce was granted, Armstrong appeared on BBC Two's Strictly: It Takes Two programme to give a make-up tutorial. In a pre-recorded element of Strictly Come Dancing's sister show on Tuesday, Armstrong - the show's head make-up artist - created a glamorous punk look for viewers to recreate at home. No reference was made made to McPartlin and Armstrong's divorce proceedings. The couple met in 1990 on a roadshow in Newcastle, when they were both aspiring pop stars. Armstrong was in a band named Deuce at the time. The couple were married at Cliveden House in Berkshire in 2006. They have no children. Last year McPartlin went into rehab after struggling with a painkiller addiction that stemmed from a knee operation in 2015. He has also had problems with alcohol and was banned from driving for 20 months in April after being caught more than twice the legal drink drive limit. Following the incident, the presenter, who has worked alongside Declan Donnelly for nearly 25 years, announced he was reducing his TV commitments. It was confirmed earlier this year that he would not present the next series of I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! and would instead be replaced by Holly Willoughby. Donnelly also presented a number of episodes of Saturday Night Takeaway without McPartlin in April after his drink-driving conviction. Despite stepping out of the spotlight, McPartlin is still in contention for an award at the National Television Awards.

"By Ian YoungsEntertainment & arts reporter In topping the Sound of 2021 list, Pa Salieu follows in the footsteps of previous winners like Adele, Ellie Goulding and Michael Kiwanuka. He knows the headlines could have been different, however. ""If I died last year,"" he begins, reflecting on how he was shot in the head outside a pub in his home city in 2019. ""If I actually died - in their eyes, I would be a criminal."" That's how he believes he would have been perceived by the authorities, the press and the outside world. ""'Gang related. Drive-by shooting.' Trust me, the whole perception would be different right now. You would have never heard of me. If you do hear of me, it's, 'That's that kid that died.' 'Gun crime.' 'These foolish youths.' No."" The life Salieu talks and raps about is murky and precarious. He has been in trouble with the law, arrested six years ago for possessing a knife - for his defence, he insists. ""Police used to say I'm in a gang. I wasn't in a gang. I was never in a gang. Because I used to try to survive? I got caught with a knife when I was 17? What, because I'm paranoid of the streets? ""I got shot in the head. People get killed every day for no reason where I'm from. I don't expect no-one to understand."" Forty years after The Specials' Ghost Town painted Coventry as a city in decline, Salieu raps about it as ""COV, #CityOfViolence"". But he now wants to be the voice for those who could not make it out, like the two close friends who were killed. ""Our voices count,"" he says. Salieu's debut mixtape Send Them To Coventry - named after the saying for deliberately ostracising or marginalising someone - can also be life-affirming. Now 23, he was born in Slough, then spent six years of his childhood in The Gambia before being sent to Coventry at the age of eight. His fresh voice has a lilt that serves to soften the edges of the stories he tells. Musically, he has more depth and guile than most two-dimensional hip-hop pretenders. His smart wordplay is delivered against an inventive range of backdrops, from the slowed-down siren of Frontline - the song that started to build his buzz early last year - to the soft slow-jam synths of More Paper. ""He has a unique perspective on Britain,"" says BBC Radio 1 DJ Annie Mac, who was among the 160 tastemakers who voted for Sound of 2021. ""His songs are exquisitely produced, with enough restraint for Pa's voice to shine through and have the space to tell the stories of his life. They are stories of friendship and family, of violence, exclusion and racism, and they act as timeless evidence of British street life at the turn of new decade."" Read the full interview with Pa Salieu below. What is BBC Sound of 2021? How has 2020 been for you? 2020's been sick. It's just been a year of taking life in. I'm excited for next year and what's to come, and 2020 has given me the chance to see the light. The light's there but I'm still in that tunnel. Your auntie is a folk singer in The Gambia - did she inspire you to get involved in music? She's always been around and she goes to so many Gambian and Senegalese events. Folk music is part of your past and who you are. Back home, that's what it means. But me getting into music was out of nowhere. I just saw a studio and fell in love with it. I was like, ""Woah, I like how my voice sounds in this."" I could basically make my voice into an instrument. You were sent to Coventry when you came back from The Gambia? Straight to Coventry, yeah. Straight to the trenches. What was it like - why do you call it the trenches? Gambia is sick. I was born in England but my first language is technically Wolof. In Gambia, I learned who I am and what I am. My history, my culture. In England, I learned what life is. This is real life. Two different kinds of lessons. I feel like I'm lucky. Was it a shock to come to Coventry? Yeah. In Coventry, Hillfields is a hood. It's the gutter in that area. Since Gambia I was sent straight to Hills and [went] nowhere else. Watching the ends [streets] change, watching the years go by, nothing really changed. The violence just went worse. More youth clubs closed down. Survival - that's what I learned in Hillfields. I didn't see crackheads or crack-fiends like that in Gambia. When I was a kid going to school [in Coventry], you have to pass fiends. You have to pass night workers. It was the morning, but night workers were still about, you know what I'm saying? Never did I know most of my friends were going to turn into crackheads, most of my friends are going to die from the circumstances of the ends. That's what I learned here. Real life. You know what I'm saying? Being shot must have been terrifying. Actually it's less painful than getting stabbed. It's shocking not knowing if you're going to live or not. That's when it's shocking. I was just trying not to close my eyes. It's scary but it's the weirdest feeling I've ever had. I was more focused on the blood coming out. Has that changed you? Nah. A lot of stuff to open my eyes has happened way before that. The music, I had to get serious with it after my best friend got killed. Then a few months after, my other best friend got killed. Everything I've learned back home is embedded in me, everything I've seen here is embedded in me. Trust me, I should be strong regardless of that gunshot or anything. It's another eye-opener. I've been shot at, but it's never actually hit me until that moment. It's just normal. All I can do is look forward, as always. Why did somebody want to shoot you? I don't know. People get shot every day. Wrong place, wrong time. People hate on you. It's the hood. It's different. It is a treacherous world, believe it or not. Very treacherous. People die for no reason every day. It's life. The thing that matters is what you're going to do with it - let it eat you up, or rise above it? Getting shot is the same as getting fired from your job. What are you going to do with it? Rise up, or what? That's life. Everything is a lesson. You said you got serious about music after what happened to your friends - is that because you decided you had to do something with your life? I always say, either break down or make it out. There are so many friends that have lost their life, turned into crackheads or [been] in prison for a very long time. Their voices ain't going to be heard like that. I'm going to be the voice of that as much as I can. That's my intention. Hood representative. No-one can understand what we've been through. But I know a lot of people who've been through what I've been through, or coming from where I'm coming from, can relate to that. That's their voices. So many voices can't be heard. It's so sad. I am the voice. And that spurs you on? Yeah. My best friend had a clothing line called Money Moves before he died. You see why I hit music even more after he died, because he was one of the first people to try to do something. He went and printed his own shirts. Started it. We all started helping, pushing it. When I started music, he pushed me the most. Is there a message you want to send with your music? Build. Unity. That's what we lack. Where I come from, we lack compassion. It's going to have to come from me. I'm not a punchline artist. Everything I say is exactly how I feel and exactly what I see and exactly where I'm coming from. My message is just build, build, build. Break down or make it out. Protect your energy. Protect everything. Sound of 2021 - the rest of the top five Who are your role models? To be honest, my grandparents. Simple, spiritual, kind-hearted. That's all that you need in life. You can be the richest or the maddest businessman in the world - you need pure vibes, that's what counts. Coventry is UK City of Culture in 2021. Is it a good place to make music? It just needs more opportunity. There's so much talent. Different kinds of music, different cultures infused with their lives. But it lacks opportunity, which we need to push, which we will push. Do you know Coventry's musical history, people like The Specials? Yeah, my best friend that got killed, his granddad was Neville Staple, he was in The Specials. [Staple's grandson Fidel Glasgow was stabbed to death in 2018.] I knew his granddad used to make music but I never knew the powers of it. Then he just died. So it's not a joke. His name has to live on. What are you aiming for in 2021? I aim for progression. Just building, still. I'm so laid-back, bro. I work every day - I ain't slept for the last five days - but I'm so laid back as in I don't pressure myself. I accept that this is the start.","Rapper Pa Salieu has won BBC Music's Sound of 2021 - identifying him as Britain's most exciting musical talent thanks to his adventurous, infectious tracks with hard-hitting lyrics about life and death on the ""frontline"" in Coventry."
"The charismatic Eastern European refugee became world famous for monumental installations, covering huge objects in miles of fabric and rope. Every project was preposterous in concept, taking decades to design, finance and deliver. He wrapped enormous buildings, avenues of trees, entire coastlines and island chains. Each one cost millions with official permission almost impossible to get. Yet, when finally completed, they were gone again in a matter of weeks. It was a life of herculean tasks. His determination to see them through never dimmed. Even in his eighties, he was working on a scheme to rival the pharaohs. A vast stairway to heaven in the deserts of Abu Dhabi, made from 410,000 brightly coloured oil barrels. A final, grand statement larger than the Great Pyramid itself. Christo Vladimirov Javacheff was born on 13 June 1935 in Gabrovo, a small town in the Bulgarian mountains. His father Ivan was a chemist who ran a factory making fabrics. His mother, Tzeta Dimitrova, a political activist. Their social circle was one of artists and intellectuals, the household a swirl of radical ideas questioning the boundaries of contemporary culture. A bohemian childhood, where artistic creativity was encouraged from the start, was constantly disrupted by war. As a boy, Christo saw his country first brutally uprooted; first by the Nazis and then the Russians. Politics, as well as art, shaped his early years. In 1952, he attended the Art Academy in Sofia. There he was expected to join the Communist Youth and produce realistic, anti-capitalist work glorifying the values of socialism. He turned out the kind of populist propaganda pieces the system demanded. But he found it suffocating. ""The work of art,"" he would say, ""is a scream of freedom."" He moved to Prague, got into theatre design and immersed himself in the works of great artists; Miro, Matisse, Kandinsky. When the Hungarian revolution broke out, he saw students and intellectuals like himself dealt with ruthlessly. So he fled. Bribing a railway worker, he hid on a train taking medicine to Austria. He made it to Vienna but found himself officially stateless - dirt poor and unable to speak the language in a Europe awash with refugees. Jeanne-Claude A few years later, he washed up in Paris. He scraped a living painting portraits on the street, something he likened to prostitution. A woman saw an example at the hairdressers and liked it, inviting the struggling artist to her chateaux to paint a picture of her. The woman's daughter was flame-haired Jeanne-Claude. She would become Christo's wife, his muse, his voice and life-long business partner and creative soul mate. ""Mother's brought home another stray,"" she thought at the time. Fortunately, that first impression didn't last. He showed her his 'real work'. In 1920, Man Ray had wrapped a sewing machine with a blanket, appropriating an everyday object and making it art. Profoundly influenced, Christo's garret was stuffed floor-to-ceiling with similar pieces. ""My God"", she recalled thinking. ""This guy is crazy!"" She got pregnant and married a more suitable man but walked out after three weeks. She and Christo were never apart again. Jeanne-Claude's father, a four-star general in the French army, didn't speak to her for years. Art on an epic scale What followed was an extraordinary artistic collaboration lasting more than 50 years. At first, their work was credited to Christo alone, feeling that it was easier for one person's name to become established. Only latterly did Jeanne-Claude's contribution get the equal billing it deserved. She encouraged him away from small objects in favour of the monumental. In 1962, reacting to the building of the Berlin Wall, they blocked off the Rue Visconti in Paris with a pile of oil drums some 4m high. They begged the police to let it stand for a while but within hours it had gone. They moved to New York, living in an illegal squat as undocumented migrants. He began producing the sketches and project plans they sold to finance their creations. She took on the logistics and gathered the necessary permissions. In 1969, they wrapped more than 2km of coastline in Little Bay, Australia. In places, the cliffs soared to more than 26m high. It took an hour to walk from one end of the installation to the other. Next, they created a fabric fence in California - nearly 40km long and 6m high. Nine lawyers were hired to persuade dozens of local farmers to give their blessing. In 1983, the couple surrounded 11 islands in Miami's Biscayne Bay with more than 600,000 square metres of bright pink polypropylene. The material was individually cut to fit each shoreline. Four hundred people were needed to put everything into place. Walkways were sewn into the fabric for the public. The 'exhibit' was up for just two weeks, then all 11km of it was taken down. The absence of meaning Christo and Jeanne-Claude wanted their works to be joyful and beautiful, encouraging the observer to see the familiar anew. But they refused to give these vast creations any 'meaning' past an immediate aesthetic impact. The direct impact on the environment was controversial. The couple were careful to recycle everything they used. And none of it was built to last. Its temporary nature was a key part of the concept. Like the rainbow, its momentary existence was what made it all so wonderful. ""They all go away when they're finished,"" Christo once said of his creations. ""Only the preparatory drawings and collages are left, giving my works an almost legendary character. I think it takes much greater courage to create things to be gone than to create things that will remain."" Up to a point, perhaps. The site-specific creations might have been designed with a fleeting wow factor in mind, but as a body of work they spoke to important themes - impact on the environment, 20th Century human conflict, and the need for perseverance in defence of freedom of expression. In 1984, they wrapped the Pont Neuf in Paris. It took them nine years to persuade the mayor, Jacques Chirac, to let them do it. Forty thousand metres of golden sandstone fabric was used, chosen to imitate colour of the pavements at sunset. Next was a $26m project to erect thousands of huge umbrellas - blue ones in Japan, yellow ones in southern California. They were paid for, as always, by the sale of Christo's drawings. They never accepted sponsorship, which would have imposed unacceptable limitations on their art. Three million came to look and picnic in the shade. Years of lobbying came to fruition in 1995, when the German parliament allowed them to spread 100,000m of fireproof material around the Reichstag. All tied down with 15km of rope. The most difficult was the one closest to home. Its title, The Gates, Central Park, New York 1979-2005, referred to the years it had taken them to persuade the city to let them do it. In February 2005, more than 7,000 gates made from saffron coloured fabric were finally placed along the paths that wind through the Big Apple's green lung. Together, they formed a fluttering trail 37km long. Five million came to be amazed. A week later, everything was packed away. Legacy Jeanne-Claude died in 2009 after complications following a brain aneurysm. For years she had been seen as little more than Christo's business partner and PR manager. In reality, they were two sides of the same creative coin, travelling in different planes so that, if one died, their artistic vision would survive. Without her, Christo pushed on with their unfinished projects. In 2016, he installed a series of walkways on Lake Iseo near Brescia, Italy. Visitors could walk for more than 3km, just above the calm surface of the waters, from the mainland to the islands of Monte Isola and San Pedro. ""The most beautiful part,"" he said, ""is about the people walking nowhere. It's not like going to the shop, not going to see your friends. It's really going nowhere."" Despite his claim his work was nothing more than the impact of the aesthetic on the human senses, Christo will be remembered for a body of work that pushed artistic boundaries. He challenged the idea that sculpture has be something fixed and permanent. He deliberately blurred the line between art and its natural environment. And he did it on a truly epic scale. His death means we will never see all his visions come to reality. There were plenty that never made it past the drawing board. Even decades of lobbying never let him wrap some of the skyscrapers in New York. He cancelled a plan to cover the Colorado River, despite spending $14m getting permission, in protest at the election of Donald Trump. A plan to wrap the Arc de Triomphe in Paris is still set to go ahead next year, but who knows if his scheme in the desert will ever make it from design stage to reality in his absence? It is intended to be 500ft high, with a base the size of the piazza at St Peter's in Rome. And this one, the only one of all his projects, was designed to be permanent. A lasting tribute to an extraordinary creative partnership whose every scheme was more innovative, ambitious and dauntingly complicated than the last.","Once a penniless painter on the boulevards of Paris, nobody did art like Christo."
"The Scottish actor was best known for his portrayal of James Bond, being the first to bring the role to the big screen and appearing in seven of the spy thrillers. Sir Sean died peacefully in his sleep in the Bahamas, having been ""unwell for some time"", his son said. His acting career spanned seven decades and he won an Oscar in 1988 for his role in The Untouchables. Sir Sean's other films included The Hunt for Red October, Highlander, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade and The Rock. Jason Connery said his father ""had many of his family, who could be in the Bahamas, around him"" when he died overnight in Nassau. Much of the Bond film Thunderball had been filmed there. He said: ""We are all working at understanding this huge event as it only happened so recently, even though my dad has been unwell for some time. ""A sad day for all who knew and loved my dad and a sad loss for all people around the world who enjoyed the wonderful gift he had as an actor."" His publicist Nancy Seltzer said: ""There will be a private ceremony followed by a memorial yet to be planned once the virus has ended."" He leaves his wife Micheline and sons Jason and Stephane. Daniel Craig, the current James Bond, said Sir Sean was ""one of the true greats of cinema"". ""Sir Sean Connery will be remembered as Bond and so much more,"" he said. ""He defined an era and a style. The wit and charm he portrayed on screen could be measured in megawatts; he helped create the modern blockbuster. ""He will continue to influence actors and film-makers alike for years to come. My thoughts are with his family and loved ones."" In reference to Sir Sean's love of golf, he added: ""Wherever he is, I hope there is a golf course."" Dame Shirley Bassey, who sang the themes to three Bond films including Goldfinger, paid tribute saying: ""I'm incredibly saddened to hear of Sean's passing. ""My thoughts are with his family. He was a wonderful person, a true gentleman and we will be forever connected by Bond."" Sir Sean, from Fountainbridge in Edinburgh, had his first major film appearance in 1957 British gangster film No Road Back. He first played James Bond in Dr No in 1962 and went on to appear in five other official films - and the unofficial Never Say Never Again in 1983. He was largely regarded as being the best actor to have played 007 in the long-running franchise, often being named as such in polls. A 20th Century movie icon Connery made the character of James Bond his own, blending ruthlessness with sardonic wit. Many critics didn't like it and some of the reviews were scathing. But the public did not agree. The action scenes, sex and exotic locations were a winning formula. In truth, his Bond is now a museum piece; the portrayal of women impossibly dated. The action scenes are still thrilling, but the sex too often bordered on the non-consensual. Thankfully, its been a while since 007 slapped a woman on the backside and forced a kiss. But Connery's performance was of its time, enjoyed by millions of both sexes and gave the silver screen a 20th Century icon. Read more about the life of the Scotsman who became a global star He was knighted by the Queen at Holyrood Palace in 2000. In August, he celebrated his 90th birthday. Bond producers Michael G Wilson and Barbara Broccoli said they were ""devastated by the news"" of his death. They said: ""He was and shall always be remembered as the original James Bond whose indelible entrance into cinema history began when he announced those unforgettable words 'the name's Bond... James Bond'. ""He revolutionised the world with his gritty and witty portrayal of the sexy and charismatic secret agent. He is undoubtedly largely responsible for the success of the film series and we shall be forever grateful to him."" Star Wars director George Lucas, who also created the Indiana Jones character, said Sir Sean ""left an indelible mark in cinematic history"". ""He will always hold a special place in my heart as Indy's dad. With an air of intelligent authority and sly sense of comedic mischief, only someone like Sean Connery could render Indiana Jones immediately into boyish regret or relief through a stern fatherly chiding or rejoiceful hug. ""I'm thankful for having had the good fortune to have known and worked with him. My thoughts are with his family."" Just the seven as 007 - Connery's Bond movies Sir Sean was a long-time supporter of Scottish independence, saying in interviews in the run-up to the 2014 referendum that he might return from his Bahamas home to live in Scotland if it voted to break away from the rest of the UK. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: ""I was heartbroken to learn this morning of the passing of Sir Sean Connery. Our nation today mourns one of her best loved sons. ""Sean was born into a working class Edinburgh family and through talent and sheer hard work, became an international film icon and one of the world's most accomplished actors. Sean will be remembered best as James Bond - the classic 007 - but his roles were many and varied. ""He was a global legend but, first and foremost, a patriotic and proud Scot - his towering presence at the opening of the Scottish Parliament in 1999 showed his love for the country of his birth. Sean was a lifelong advocate of an independent Scotland and those of us who share that belief owe him a great debt of gratitude."" Alex Salmond, former first minister of Scotland, who was close friends with Sir Sean, described him as ""the world's greatest Scot, the last of the real Hollywood stars, the definitive Bond"". He said: ""Sean Connery was all of these things but much more. He was also a staunch patriot, a deep thinker and outstanding human being."" He added: ""'Scotland Forever' wasn't just tattooed on his forearm but was imprinted on his soul.""","Sir Sean Connery has died at the age of 90, his family has said."
"The 44-year-old told The Daily Mail the drama would be ""epic in scope"" and follow the lives of a group of friends and their families from 1968 to 2014. ""I don't think there has been a serious drama series in Britain with black people from all walks of life as the main protagonists,"" McQueen said. The director is expected to pick up an Oscar nomination next week. He was nominated for a best director Bafta earlier this week, adding to his growing collection of nods for his work on 12 Years a Slave. McQueen said his BBC project, which is still in its early stages, would be developed over the next year with a writer and group of actors. He said it would be set in London, adding: ""This isn't a black Our Friends in the North"", referencing the 1996 BBC drama which followed four friends from Newcastle. The BBC confirmed it was teaming up with McQueen and Rainmark Films on the project, but would not give any further information. ""It is too early to announce the details, but it is incredibly exciting to be working with the hugely talented British director who has rapidly become one of the finest directors in the world,"" BBC drama controller Ben Stephenson said. McQueen, who was born in London but now lives in Amsterdam, first found fame as a video artist, winning the Turner Prize in 1999. His mainstream movie career began with 2008's Hunger about the Northern Irish hunger strikers, followed by 2011 sex addiction film Shame - both starring Michael Fassbender.",12 Years a Slave director Steve McQueen is working on a drama about the lives of black Britons for the BBC.
"Reactions range from the ""BBC has killed Top Gear"", to praise for a ""brave BBC"". The story was also news for media in areas as far apart as Latin America and Europe, with the Russian Defence Ministry even offering Clarkson a job at its own TV station. French daily Figaro said the announcement had had ""the effect of a bomb on Twitter"". It added that ""the sense of disappointment can be read in messages posted on the social network across the Channel and even in France"". Italian journalist Federico Garimberti recalled on Twitter: ""Like it or not, a BBC that shows Clarkson the door demonstrates that it doesn't give a damn about its audience. Top Gear is watched by 350 million people in 212 countries."" ""This is the end of Top Gear as we know it,"" Jan Micka exclaimed on the Czech website Auto.cz. In Iran, a disappointed Twitter user tried to start a trend in defence of the British TV presenter. ""We are all Jeremy Clarkson,"" declared @CmpiChism, arguing that ""no one can present like him"". Other Iranians seemed to agree. Saman Vatanshenasan wrote on Facebook that it was ""meaningless to imagine the Top Gear without Jeremy... I need to say this in support of him that I am Jeremy Clarkson"". ""Now that the BBC has sacked Clarkson does anyone watch Top Gear anymore? They are crazy,"" @sellar said on Twitter. 'Principles over profit' But not everyone in Iran on social media was pro-Clarkson. Facebook user Mohammad E. Amini pointed out that it was ""important to know the red line between fame and extremism"". ""BBC saved its name by making this decision,"" he added. ""BBC decision to stop its cooperation with Clarkson was a very brave and respectable move. Even if you have 30 million viewers there is still no reason for assault,"" argued @jaavid on Twitter. In the Czech Republic, the move to drop the Top Gear presenter was welcomed by journalist Ivan Kytka. ""For the BBC, principles are clearly more important than profit. Money is not the most important thing for a public service broadcaster,"" he said on the Czech TV website. The BBC's decision not to renew Clarkson's contract was greeted with approval by internet users in Argentina. Last September, the Top Gear crew had to abandon filming in the country amid angry protests over a car number plate that appeared to refer to the Falklands War. ""Thanks Jeremy… we don't need you around here… when you do come back it'll be to cover the story of when your delinquent countrymen give back the Malvinas [Falklands],"" said a reader in the online forum of Clarin newspaper. ""The best TV channel in the world can't have this type of employee,"" was another opinion in the same forum. Russian job? Many social media users were amused the BBC's announcement coincided with news of singer Zayn Malik leaving the successful British boy band One Direction. ""Jeremy Clarkson and Zayn Malik could team up to form a new boy band - Top Direction,"" ‏@sicfallacy suggested on Twitter. But for Italian user Mauro Scarpoloni, Clarkson was obviously the more popular brand. ""So the real drama is not One Direction, it's that the BBC has killed @BBC_TopGear #BringBackClarkson,"" he tweeted. In Russia, the story seemed to acquire a political dimension. Interfax news agency quoted St Petersburg councillor Vitaliy Milonov as saying: ""Clarkson will be able to find a great job in our country, where he will not be told how to host a TV programme."" Zvezda, the TV channel controlled by the Russian Defence Ministry, announced on its website that it had officially offered to employ the former Top Gear presenter. It published a letter to Clarkson in English: ""Dear Jeremy, the Russian Armed Forces Broadcasting Company 'Zvezda' expresses deep honour to you and kindly asks for cooperation.

"Sport Relief, which is on TV on the BBC on Friday, takes place every other year, alternating with Red Nose Day. The Comic Relief charity runs both events and said most of its films would just feature people who live in those countries speaking for themselves. MP David Lammy had said they portrayed Africans as ""victims to be pitied"". The Sport Relief and Red Nose Day telethons usually feature clips of well-known personalities meeting people in places where the charity works, including Africa. 'Local heroes' But Comic Relief chief executive Liz Warner said: ""This year, we are putting people at the heart of the films. ""We haven't sent celebrities, for the night of TV, to Africa. People are telling their stories in their own voices, and we are using local heroes."" A 2017 Red Nose Day film fronted by Ed Sheeran, about street children in Liberia, was named the ""most offensive"" campaign last year by a fundraising pressure group. In it, the singer was seen meeting a young boy before offering to pay for a hotel for him and his friends. The Radi-Aid awards said it was almost ""poverty tourism"". Warner told Radio 4's World at One they were continuing to work with celebrities - just in a different way. ""It's in our DNA,"" she said of having stars at the centre of their campaigns. ""But we're continuing to evolve how we make our films."" Asked about the Sheeran film, she added: ""We're very proud of what Ed did. The celebrities give of their time and they do amazing things for us. We're just trying to work out how we work with them."" The charity plans to enlist more celebrities to speak about issues that are close to their hearts - such as with Zoe Ball's cycling challenge to raise awareness of male mental health. Friday's Sport Relief will include a film about street children in Uganda. It will be introduced by Rio Ferdinand, but he will not appear in the clip himself. Instead, it will feature the children and a charity worker. Stars will appear in films about the UK, though, with John Bishop fronting a clip about a project near his home in the north-west of England. Sport Relief, which aims to raise millions for disadvantaged people in the UK and around the world, is a week-long event this year, culminating in the live broadcast on Friday night. The move comes after David Lammy made a film for BBC Two's Daily Politics, saying Comic Relief had ""tattooed images of poverty in Africa to our national psyche"" - and was not showing the full reality of life on the continent. ""Sports Relief should be helping to establish the people of Africa as equals to be respected, not as victims to be pitied,"" he said. ""So, rather than getting celebrities to act as tour guides, why not get Africans to talk for themselves about the continent and the problems that they know?"" 'Step in the right direction' Lammy has agreed to talk to Comic Relief - and has been invited to make a film for them himself. He said on Friday: ""I am pleased that Comic Relief has listened to concerns that I have raised and will be making changes to their output. ""I hope that the films they make will respect and empower African people and amplify their voices instead of patronising them. This represents a step in the right direction and some progress.""

"By Steven McIntoshEntertainment reporter Be More Chill, which has been praised for attracting a new teen audience to the theatre, will open at The Other Palace in February, the BBC can reveal. The pop-rock, sci-fi musical tells the story of an anxious teenager who takes a pill in order to become more popular. The soundtrack has played a large part in making the show a sleeper hit - racking up 300 million streams. ""Ever since its sellout off-Broadway run, the show has become a hit with the best kind of social-media word of mouth powering its progress to Broadway,"" wrote Tim Teeman in The Daily Beast. ""It has brought, so observers have noted, a younger audience to the theatre. It has caused great excitement and created extreme fandom."" Be More Chill originally premiered in 2015 at the Two River Theatre in Red Bank, New Jersey. It had a limited run there and little was made of the cast soundtrack which was quietly released on streaming services. In 2017, the number of online listeners to the recording started growing, and the show began to attract a cult following, particularly among young people - most of whom hadn't seen the show, but still created Tumblr pages, YouTube videos, blogs and art fiction in tribute to it. As a result, the show was revived by its creators the following year, first as an off-Broadway production before it transferred to the Lyceum Theatre for a run on Broadway. ""I'm a little older and so I'm used to word-of-mouth being telling my friends about an amazing show or movie,"" Be More Chill's producer Jerry Goehring tells BBC News. ""And in the old days we had radio that would play a song and it would be popular. Word of mouth would happen in different ways. ""Well today, clearly it happens online. When I first heard about this show from Joe Iconis [who wrote the music], there was something like 10 million streams of a CD that had just been released. Now fast forward to the off-Broadway run, and suddenly there were 100 million streams, and now we're well over 300 million streams."" Describing the storyline, he explains: ""It starts out as a standard boy-has-a-crush-on-a-girl story. And he really wants to date this girl but he's kind of the nerd who doesn't fit in, and she's quite a quirky young lady, she doesn't quite fit in in her world. ""And then we go into a little bit of sci-fi, where now this guy says 'hey I've got this pill here, and if you take it, it's basically a super computer that will implant itself in your brain and tell you how to act the right way and see the right things so that you fit in. ""It's kind of like your alter-ego is going into your head, and it will tell you how to get that girl, how to dress right, how do you become the cool guy?"" From the premise, it's not hard to see why the show has found a young audience. The more traditional theatre critics, however, weren't so convinced. ""For much of the two-and-a-half hours this critic was dreaming of future Broadway shows, where producers did away with all these familiar ingredients, the safe white face with their nerd/outsider/not-so outsider-actually problems and safe and predictable story and character tropes,"" said AD Amorosi in Variety. Mashable's Erin Strecker added: ""Be More Chill doesn't grapple with the issues right in front of its face. It wants to say something profound about the pressures of being a young person in 2019, but instead settles for a stereotype-filled retrograde story straight out of the '80s."" Goehring responds: ""Maybe some of the older, more staunch industry reviewers, felt like 'you can't tell me what's good and not good just because you like it'. ""We brought a piece of theatre which was brought to the stage ultimately by the people that responded to it, and who would've thought a show that's so not in the mainstream of commercial musicals, but a small musical that has heart, actually made it to the Broadway stage?"" He adds that the themes of the musical resonate with a young audience in a way that might be missed by more traditional theatre reviewers. ""Young people for some people don't have the same filters that older people have,"" Geohring says. ""They can look under the hood a little bit and look at all the issues that this show has that it doesn't wear on its sleeve. We don't talk about suicide or bullying - that's all there, but we don't preach it. It's not written that way, you have to look just under the surface to see these things. ""And I think younger people who have a more keen sense of writing that is not on your sleeve, they got it right away. Those that come in and take it at face value and don't look a little under the surface at those issues, I think it's easy to take that point of view if that is your inclination."" Composer and lyricist Joe Iconis has previously said musical theatre is the perfect language for teens to explore themes such as this. ""Teenage characters are going through the same things adults are, they just don't have the vocabulary to express themselves, or they haven't built up the walls adults do,"" he told The Guardian last year. ""There's this idea in musical theatre that you sing when your emotions are too big to do anything else but sing. For me, that's the teenage experience."" Be More Chill opens at The Other Palace in February 2020.",A new musical which became a word-of-mouth hit in the US is set to open in London after a successful Broadway run.
"Travis spent 25 years on BBC Radio 1, including two as the host of the Breakfast Show. He appeared numerous times on TV programmes such as Top of the Pops, making the larger-than-life personality a household name. He started his career as a nightclub DJ in Manchester in the early 1960s before joining pirate station Radio Caroline, broadcasting from ships off the coasts of Essex and the Isle of Man. One of many pirate DJs to be recruited by the BBC, Travis joined the new pop music station Radio 1 shortly after its launch in 1967. A hit with his personable style and madcap humour, he became the third Radio 1 Breakfast Show host when he took over from Noel Edmonds in 1978. It was during his early morning stint that the heavily-bearded presenter, who had previously adopted the nickname The Hairy Monster, began referring to himself as The Hairy Cornflake. The disc jockey also became known for his wacky sound effects - including his trademark ""quack quack oops"" - and games such as snooker on the radio. He was a regular host of Top of the Pops in the 1970s and 80s and is one of the few presenters to have also sung on the show. His 1976 novelty hit Convoy GB, released under the name Laurie Lingo and the Dipsticks, reached number four in the charts. But by the 1990s, the time had come for Travis to make way for a new generation. When a new controller started an overhaul of Radio 1, Travis jumped before he could be pushed. He surprised his bosses and listeners by announcing his resignation live on air in 1993. ""Changes are being made here which go against my principles, and I just cannot agree with them,"" he declared. As well as being a star on Radio 1, Travis was known to millions worldwide through his music request programme A Jolly Good Show on the BBC World Service. He first hosted the show in 1981 and remained until 2001, winning fans including the Burmese pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who said it had given her a lifeline during more than two decades of house arrest. Ms Suu Kyi said the show had made her ""world much more complete"" and she met Travis in London in 2012. After Radio 1, Travis went on to host shows on stations including Classic Gold, Magic AM, BBC Three Counties Radio and Spain's Spectrum FM. But in November 2012, Travis - whose real name is David Patrick Griffin - was arrested on suspicion of sexual offences. At a trial earlier this year the star, who is now 69, was cleared of 12 counts of indecent assault, alleged to have taken place between 1976 and 2008. 'Larger than life' The jury failed to reach verdicts on two counts - indecent assault against a theatre hand while in pantomime in 1990, and sexual assault of a journalist in his home in 2008 - and he was retried on those, plus indecent assault against a researcher on the Mrs Merton show. He was acquitted of the assault on the theatre hand, and cleared of the assault on the journalist after the jury failed to reach a verdict, but found guilty of the 1995 attack on the TV researcher. During his court appearances, Travis told jurors: ""I have never said, in my life, that I am a sex symbol. No, I am a big, hairy, cuddly bear."" He was described as ""larger than life"" and a ""gentle giant"" who was tactile and gave hugs to everyone he met. Travis is a keen photographer, publishing work and being made a fellow of the British Institute of Professional Photographers. He denied that his work - which included a book of famous women including Joanna Lumley in a number of quirky costumes and poses - had a sleazy air to it. When asked on the witness stand about his penchant for photographing women, he said they are ""great subjects"", adding ""they have wonderful curves and things"". Travis has been married to his Swedish wife Marianne since 1971 and the couple live in Buckinghamshire.","Former Radio 1 DJ Dave Lee Travis, who has been given a suspended sentence of three months for indecently assaulting a woman in 1995, was one of the biggest stars of the British airwaves in the 1970s and '80s."

"Dr Couper appeared on the BBC's Blue Peter and The Sky At Night programmes, as well as presenting and producing acclaimed science documentaries. She also hosted radio series including the BBC World Service's long-running Seeing Stars and BBC Radio 4's Cosmic Quest and Starwatch. Professor Brian Cox said ""she was one of the pioneers in bringing astronomy to everyone, including me"". Dr Couper's best friend and business partner, Nigel Henbest, said she had died on Wednesday after a short illness. She had been a ""charismatic... and passionate communicator of science"", he said. ""She got people really excited about the Universe and about space - that was her love, her passion in life."" Born in 1949, she fell in love with astronomy as a child and recalled a day, in 1968, when she had realised astronomy was not just ""for shambolic old men in tweed jackets any more"". She went home and wrote in her diary: ""I want to help knowledge. I want to make known and publicise science."" So she left her management trainee job at Top Shop to become a research assistant at the Institute of Astronomy in Cambridge. Her big break came when she was asked to appear as a guest on Sir Patrick Moore's The Sky At Night. Sir Patrick later recalled: ""Of course, she wrote to me when she was a little girl and said, 'Is there any future for me in astronomy?' And I said, 'Of course there is.' And I tried to give her a hand."" Astronaut application She also presented the 1981 ITV children's series Heavens Above and, in 1984, became the first female president of the British Astronomical Association. Four years later, she co-founded a film and TV production company, then, in 1993, took up the chair of astronomy at Gresham College. She and Dr Henbest co-wrote dozens of books as well as monthly astronomy columns for the Independent, the last of which was published on 6 February. The pair even applied to be the first British astronauts, Dr Couper told the Guardian in 1993, but were quickly rejected. ""They wanted someone technologically on the ball, someone who would know what buttons to press in an emergency,"" she said. ""If something blew up, I would think, 'Oh Christ! What wire goes where?'"" More tributes came from viewers, fellow broadcasters and the scientific community.",Broadcaster and astronomer Heather Couper has died at the age of 70.
"The singer, actress and former X Factor judge has been cast as Penny, the dance partner of lead character Jonny Castle, the Hollywood Reporter said. Dancer and actor Colt Prattes is to play Jonny, with Oscar-nominee Abigail Breslin playing opposite him as Baby Houseman in the show by US network ABC. Scherzinger tweeted she was ""so excited"" to join the cast. The three-hour remake, which will be directed by The Sapphires director Wayne Blair, has yet to get a transmission date. Set in the summer of 1963, Dirty Dancing is the song-and-dance love story about 17-year-old Baby, originally played by Jennifer Grey, who falls for her working-class dance instructor, Johnny Castle - played by Patrick Swayze. The role of Penny was played by Cynthia Rhodes in the 1987 film. Eleanor Bergstein, who wrote the screenplay for the original movie and was also behind the successful Dirty Dancing musical, is on board for the small screen adaptation to be produced by Lionsgate TV. Previously in 2011, Lionsgate announced plans to remake the film for the big screen, with Kenny Ortega - who choreographed the original and directed High School Musical - at the helm.",Nicole Scherzinger is to star in a TV remake of the 1987 classic movie Dirty Dancing according to reports.
"By Lizo MzimbaEntertainment correspondent, BBC News A record 76 baby girls were called Khaleesi in 2017, the title enjoyed by Emilia Clarke's dragon-raising would-be queen in the award-winning fantasy TV and book series. Three more children were called Daenarys, the real name of the show's Mother of Dragons. And more girls than ever before received the name Sansa, another significant figure on the show. But if baby-naming is a reliable indicator, Game of Thrones' most popular character appears to be Arya, with 343 newborns given the same name as Maisie Williams' sword-wielding Stark. That's a big increase on 302, the number of Aryas named in 2016. Eleven baby boys, the same number as in 2016, ended up being called Tyrion, almost certainly in tribute to Peter Dinklage's Tyrion Lannister - perhaps the show's most intelligent character. Animated movie Moana was released at the end of 2016, explaining why seven babies ended up receiving that particular name in 2017 - seven more than the previous year. The Star Wars universe has also continued to wield its influence on name choices. It's likely the death of Carrie Fisher in December 2016 was a contributing factor to the big increase (to 149) in girls being called Leia. Indeed, more children than ever before have been given names from a galaxy far, far away. Twenty-one were called Rey and 70 were called Kylo, almost certainly after the characters played by Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver in recent Star Wars instalments. Three girls were given the name - but hopefully not the personality characteristics - of Harley-Quinn in 2017. The DC Comics villain and Joker's girlfriend was memorably played by Margot Robbie in the film Suicide Squad. In a similar vein, the success of the TV series Lucifer, in which the Devil leaves Hell and travels to Los Angeles, seems to have resulted in 11 boys being given the name of the show. It began in 2016, the year the name Lucifer entered the list for the first time. Four babies were given the name that year, a figure that increased by seven in 2017. Reality TV is also getting in on the act. Before Made in Chelsea, the name Binky had never featured on the list. That all changed in 2014, and the number of Binkys has steadily increased with 10 newborns getting the name last year. In case you were wondering, Binky Felstead's real name is Alexandra. Choosing the right name for a newborn can be a tricky business. Luckily the world of TV and film is overflowing with unusual suggestions, and it's somewhere more and more parents are going to for inspiration.

"In a post on Instagram, the former Take That singer said they would still work with Simon Cowell on other projects. Williams and Field only joined the show last year. Some fans were initially worried about the US TV actress's lack of experience in the music industry. But Simon said at the series 15 launch: ""Ayda has been a revelation. I mean, seriously, she's been brilliant."" He explained that you do not necessarily need to be an artist or a music manager to be on the show. ""You have to have taste, good instincts, you have got to like people,"" he said. ""Ayda has seen the music business from a different point of view so she brings a different perspective to the panel. I think she's amazing."" Field said her years spent with Williams had given her enough experience to be on the show. ""I know that I've helped Rob for 12 years now, I've had to pick him up off the ground and lift him up,"" she said. ""I am always incredibly straightforward, I say it with compassion but I stick to my word and carry it through.""

"Henry said the black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) community had ""initiative fatigue"". ""Tony Hall's announcement last week is something but with massive respect it's on an old model that doesn't work,"" he added. The BBC wants to increase BAME on-air talent to one in six people by 2017. Speaking at a culture, media and sport select committee hearing, Henry said there had been ""29 initiatives at the BBC in the last 15 years and numbers (of people from BAME backgrounds working in the industry) have gone down"". He added: ""Idris Elba and Chiwetel Ejiofor didn't need more training. They just needed a break."" Director general Lord Hall's announcement last Friday also included a series of targets for staff representation off-air and several other initiatives. In addition to a £2.1m development fund, the BBC is bringing together a group of experts, including Henry, Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson, Asian Network presenter Nihal and Lady Benjamin, to form an Independent Diversity Action Group, chaired by Lord Hall. ""I think the group will be tough-minded,"" Lord Hall said on Friday. ""But it's good to have people who are there to support you, but also say you can do better here."" Henry was addressing the select committee during its wider review of the future of the BBC ahead of the Charter Renewal in 2016/17. The actor and comedian wants the broadcasting industry to adopt the plan he launched at Bafta earlier this year to increase BAME representation - dubbed the Henry plan - based on the model that media watchdog Ofcom uses to classify programmes made in the nations and regions. In response to his comments, a BBC spokesperson said: ""Last week we set out far reaching plans that we believe will make a tangible difference - we will work hard to deliver them and of course reserve the option of going further if we fall short, but people should judge us on progress over the coming months and years before concluding the need for even more measures."" Henry's appearance at the select committee comes after the acting head of the BBC Trust, Diane Coyle, said the BBC's flagship soap EastEnders is ""almost twice"" as white as the real east London. The BBC's audience council in England had compared the population of Walthamstow in east London with Walford, the fictional home of EastEnders. E20 v E17 Ms Coyle said it would be ""daft"" for the show to be a ""perfect replica"" of the real world. But she added it was ""important to ask whether the BBC can do more in its popular output to provide an authentic portrayal of life in modern Britain"". Referring to her comments that she made during a speech at the London School of Economics on Monday, Henry said: ""EastEnders is the most ethnically diverse of any soap."" The BBC said: ""We agree with the trust that EastEnders has one of the most diverse casts on British television and that it would be daft to suggest that the programme needs to be a perfect replica of a particular postcode."" Ms Coyle is in the running to become head of the BBC Trust after Lord Patten stepped down due to ill health.",Actor Lenny Henry has criticised the BBC's plans to increase on-screen diversity by 5% in the next three years.
"The UK actor and comedian's debut on The Late, Late Show won praise from fans and critics but he says a ""rocky year"" in viewing figures lies ahead.

"By Steven McIntoshEntertainment reporter There are several precise and tricky cues for the cast to hit across the three-hour West End production. Props have to appear from (or disappear into) thin air. There are magic tricks. Characters dance upside down on the ceiling. There are scenes that involve complex choreography, kite flying and statues coming to life. It's a testament to how tightly rehearsed the show is that nothing went wrong at the show's opening night on Wednesday. ""It does sometimes!"" laughs Zizi Strallen, who plays the legendary leading role. ""But there are contingency plans, that's the beauty of live theatre, and it's my job to cover it up as well if it does go wrong."" The most complicated part of the show, she says, is a scene which will be familiar to fans of the original 1964 film starring Julie Andrews, where Poppins is seen somehow pulling huge items out of a relatively small handbag. ""Not only am I singing and being Mary Poppins, I'm then essentially doing magic tricks,"" Strallen explains, crediting the magic specialist who was hired to teach her. ""There's a magic teapot, bringing a plant out of the bag, a hat stand, a mirror, putting them all on the wall so they don't fall off. ""There's a lot of pressure in that number, a lot of things to think about. So my brain is going 100 miles per hour. And then when that number's done I think 'right, now I can just have fun'."" The reboot of the stage production, which was first staged in 2004, is the latest instalment of a franchise which the public seem endlessly fascinated by. Last year, a film sequel starring Emily Blunt - Mary Poppins Returns - took $350m (£273m) at the box office worldwide. A very healthy figure, albeit not as high as some of Disney's other recent hits. Veteran theatre producer Cameron Mackintosh, whose group Delfont Mackintosh Theatres owns the Prince Edward, where Mary Poppins is playing, says they've been holding off for the right time to bring the show back to the West End. ""It's the first time the theatre's been available, so we had to wait patiently,"" he explains. ""And also, Disney had the film last year and we would've been silly to confuse the public by bringing this back. We were on tour three years ago, and it was an enormous success, but we knew with the film coming out there was no point, we had to wait for the film."" The stage show also stars 86-year-old Petula Clark, who sings one of the film's most famous numbers, Feed The Birds. Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious and Chim Chim Cheree, naturally, also feature. New characters But there are new songs in the mix too, as well as characters who appeared in the books but won't be familiar to fans of the two films. Mr Banks regularly refers to the stern nanny from his own childhood, Miss Andrew, who then appears later in the show to take over from Poppins, much to the children's horror. Strallen says: ""I want audiences to have not necessarily a new version of Mary Poppins, just a different one. People were open to the Emily Blunt version, and this one is actually quite true to the books. So it would be lovely if they went home and read the PL Travers books. ""[We have] Mary Poppins in the park, and the park keeper is introduced, and Miss Andrew is introduced, so we have all these different elements, and I think there's something about seeing magic live which is crazy, and you just don't get that from a film."" The show was awarded a rare five-star review by The Guardian's Michael Billington, who praised the ""excellent performance"" of Strallen. ""Every movement she makes is balletic - she doesn't just exit from a room but floats out of it with arms extended,"" he said. ""Travers scholars may still miss the darkness of the books, but for the rest of us the show is an unassailable treat and Eyre's production has acquired the heart to go with its art."" The show also received warm reviews in The Telegraph, The Evening Standard and WhatsOnStage. However, Tim Bano of The Stage described the production as ""muddled"", adding: ""Even at almost three hours, the whole thing feels rushed. The songs are taken at a lick, and the production jolts from one set-piece to another without pause for breath. Watch the film, read the books. Save the magic."" The book for the show was written by Julian Fellowes, who worked on the project several years before he became best known as the architect behind the phenomenally successful Downton Abbey. ""It was a rather interesting challenge, because you're having to be true to two sources as opposed to just one,"" he tells BBC News. ""And you don't want to be disappointing for fans of the books or the film. My wife didn't even know there were books. But I enjoyed the challenge of it."" For Strallen, the themes of the show mean it could be staged ""in Edwardian times, or in the future - it works at any time"". ""Even though it's set in Edwardian London, it's about family, and it's about appreciating one another,"" she says. ""And that is kind of timeless, it's at the core of everyone's life to love and appreciate each other. Joseph Millson, who plays the children's father, George Banks, adds: ""There are two things to this. There's a financial element that it just was time to do it again and the film went well. So there's all sorts of fiscal reasons for Disney and so on, but you know what, I genuinely believe this is a show for today, that could've been written this year and put on at the National Theatre. ""That's my feeling, that there's a genuine usefulness to it. Now of course people are here to eat ice cream and forget about their troubles, but honestly, the little bit that stays with you when you leave, is really useful."" The launch of Mary Poppins follows last week's opening night of Death of a Salesman - which took place two days before a ceiling collapse prompted the theatre to be evacuated and the show to change venue. Given how many theatres in the West End are owned by Mackintosh's group, is he at all worried about the state of venues in the West End? ""No, because we've done all mine!"" he replies. ""I'm just finishing the Sondheim, which is going to be glorious and it's completely rebuilt. So I've been doing that over the last 20 years, I've been rebuilding them, and they're the most wonderful places."" Mary Poppins is now playing at the Prince Edward Theatre.",The stage adaptation of Mary Poppins is not the kind of show where the actors can afford to let their concentration lapse.
"""I'd like to bring out a project next year that isn't an album,"" he told BBC News. ""Something that isn't pushed on radio. Something that's not what I usually do, that just clears the air a little bit."" He added he'd ""happily"" take a year off when his world tour ends next September before starting his fourth album. The news may disappoint fans, but Sheeran pointed out that spending three years on tour was ""weird"" and he'd need time to decompress. The star previously took a ""gap year"" between his second record, Multiply, and its chart-conquering successor - time he spent whitewater rafting, swimming with bull sharks (without a cage) and bungee jumping. However, he admitted he had never stopped writing songs. ""I'll never not make music. It's my hobby,"" he told the BBC's Chi Chi Izundu. ""I wouldn't enjoy life if I didn't do music. ""I don't see music as work. I see this [speaking to the press] as work. No-one picks up a guitar hoping one day they're going to be interviewed."" The 27-year-old hinted his new music would be more experimental than the radio-friendly pop of Shape of You and Thinking Out Loud, namechecking his pre-fame EP No. 5 Collaborations Project, which featured UK rappers Wiley, Devlin, JME and Sway. ""I would love to do something like that again,"" he said, calling the 2011 EP ""the most interesting project I think I've ever made"". He also said he would ""love to do a musical"" and follow up his cameo roles in Game of Thrones, Bridget Jones's Baby and Home & Away with a bigger acting role. ""I'd like to make one movie. Just one,"" he said,"" and continue making albums and continue touring and hopefully have a family."" The star, who recently hinted that he has secretly married his childhood friend Cherry Seaborn, was speaking to the BBC ahead of the release of a new documentary, Songwriter, which follows his career over a 10-year period, leading up to the creation of Divide. Shot by Sheeran's cousin Murray Cummings, it includes never-before-seen videos from his childhood and fly-on-the-wall footage as he creates some of his biggest hits in the studio. ""There's no juicy gossip in it,"" he joked. ""It's just me writing songs."" However, he said he hoped the intimate, revealing film would inspire other young songwriters. ""I went to comprehensive school in Suffolk and lived in the middle of nowhere and ended up being here - and it's just through writing loads of songs and doing loads of gigs. And you can get to that. ""I didn't start off being able to sing or play guitar. I had to learn to do both of them."" In the documentary, he credits his music teacher at Thomas Mills High School, Richard Hanley, with encouraging him to pursue his dream. ""There were a lot of teachers who didn't quite get it,"" he says. ""Mr Hanley never had a doubt."" That's why he's disappointed that lessons like art, drama and music are being squeezed by widespread budget cuts. ""The thing that confuses me about it is that most of the wealthiest people in England, who stay in England and pay taxes, are musicians and artists. ""You know, Paul McCartney, Damien Hirst... All these people who have, like, hundreds of millions stay in England and pay their taxes. And half the people that don't pay their taxes have nothing to do with music. ""So what I don't understand is, if you're cutting art, drama and music from schools, that isn't going to happen any more and you're not going to have home-grown talent at all. ""They've cut it in my local high school and I've kind of been able to get them back on their feet with it - but not every school has that.

"Paltrow, 41, and Martin, 37, announced the split on her blog in a post titled Conscious Uncoupling. ""It is with hearts full of sadness that we have decided to separate,"" the couple wrote. The pair, who married in December 2003, have two children - Apple, nine, and Moses, seven. A spokeswoman for the Coldplay frontman confirmed the split, the Associated Press news agency reported. In the message on the actress' blog on the website Goop.com, the couple said they had ""come to the conclusion that while we love each other very much, we will remain separate"".

Paltrow, who won an Oscar for best actress in 1998 for Shakespeare in Love, most recently starred in Iron Man 3. Martin, whose band Coldplay are due to release their sixth studio album this year, is set to appear as a mentor in the current series of The Voice in the US. The couple married at a secret ceremony in December 2003, days after they announced Paltrow was pregnant with their first child. They had already been together for a year, after reportedly meeting backstage at a Coldplay concert.","Hollywood actress Gwyneth Paltrow and Coldplay singer Chris Martin are to separate after more than 10 years of marriage, the couple have said."
"By Taylor-Dior RumbleEntertainment reporter That's probably because everyone was far too busy tweeting about Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper's sizzling chemistry or laughing about Trevor Noah trolling the audience. Here are some of the Oscar moments that ruled social media. 1. Trevor Noah's fake translation While introducing best picture nominee Black Panther, South African comedian Trevor Noah poked fun at people who think Wakanda, the fictional African nation in which it's set, is a real place. ""Growing up as a young boy in Wakanda, I would see T'Challa flying over our village, and he would remind me of a great Xhosa phrase,"" he said. ""'Abelungu abazi ubu ndiyaxoka', which means: 'In times like these, we are stronger when we fight together than when we try to fight apart."" And while it sounded beautiful and uplifting, that's not quite what the phrase actually means. The BBC's Pumza Fihlani said the actual translation into English is: ""White people don't know that I'm lying."" While most of the audience in Hollywood was none the wiser, Xhosa speakers on social media relished in the cheeky moment. 2. Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper's steamy duet Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper performed perhaps their steamiest rendition yet of Shallow, from their film A Star is Born. The pair gazed adoringly at each other as they sang the song, with Gaga standing opposite Cooper before taking her place behind the grand piano. As the song came to an end, Cooper sat beside Gaga and laid his head on hers as they belted out the final lyrics - which was probably around the same time Twitter imploded. 3. When Olivia Colman thanked Lady Gaga As Olivia Colman accepted her award for best actress, her speech was filled with many emotional and charming moments that made the world love her even more. But the most-talked about moment was probably when she thanked and marvelled at Lady Gaga, while blowing her a kiss - because what else would you do when standing in front of greatness? 4. Richard E Grant's admiration for Barbra Streisand There's nothing more fun than seeing celebrities fawn over other celebrities - it helps us remember we're all the same. And Richard E Grant is truly all of us when we see Barbra Streisand. As we've come to expect from the star of Can You Ever Forgive Me?, who has enjoyed taking pictures with Hollywood's finest throughout awards season, we also got this (slightly blurry) selfie. 5. James McAvoy's shirt was signed by Hollywood James McAvoy was serving last day of school vibes as he asked his fellow celebrities to sign his shirt after finding a pen on the floor, as you do. Stars such as Brie Larson, Samuel L Jackson and Michael B Jordan were among those who obliged. The Split actor hopes to auction the shirt to raise money for one of the charities he supports. 6. Billy Porter's outfit stole the show on the red carpet Broadway star Billy Porter wowed everyone on the red carpet in his half-tuxedo, half-gown outfit. The black velvet dress was made by designer Christian Siriano. One user tweeted that Porter had ""set the bar impossibly high for Oscars fashion"" as the Kinky Boots star was one of the first to arrive on the carpet.

"By Ian YoungsEntertainment & arts reporter But what's it like to live in the original? Lots of the Lowry fans who make the pilgrimage to Station Road in Pendlebury, Greater Manchester, to find the house where one of Britain's most popular artists lived and worked are unsure whether they have found the right place. ""Because the plaque isn't there, people are not sure which house it is,"" says Abigail Johnson, who lives in Lowry's old home with her husband Steve and their four children. ""We see them stood outside, and sometimes we let them in to have a look around,"" Steve adds. There was a plaque on the wall. But ""one of the locals pinched it"", Steve explains. ""I believe he's got it in his bedroom, this particular fella. What use it is in his bedroom, I don't know."" The Johnson family may well notice more people lingering uncertainly outside their front door after the release of Mrs Lowry and Son on Friday. The house plays a starring role in the film, which depicts the artist's claustrophobic relationship with his bedridden, unsupportive mother. Elizabeth Lowry, played by Oscar-winner Redgrave, is unhappy at being forced to move to a working-class suburb because of her husband's debts. A line in the film, when she mistakes her son for a burglar, will ring true with the current residents, given the plaque theft. ""Anything's possible living in Pendlebury,"" the character says. ""People get up to all sorts of malpractices as soon as your back is turned."" But whereas Mrs Lowry sees the worst in the area, her son saw a beauty in the industrial landscape. The artist and his mother moved into the house in 1908, when Lowry was in his early 20s. She died in 1939, just as her son was starting to gain recognition for the now-famous scenes of busy mills and markets that he painted late at night in their attic. ""One of the things that struck me was the fact that he did all his paintings in the loft room. It is a big room but the lighting must have been rubbish,"" Mrs Johnson says. ""Even if he was to do it in the daylight, all that he would have had is the dormer window."" The addition of a modern velux window has turned the attic into the couple's bright bedroom. In the film, Mrs Lowry disappointedly describes the house as a humble ""two up, two down"", but that's not quite the case. It is in fact a six-bed end of terrace. ""They talk about this tiny little terraced house that Lowry lived in for 40 years, but it's not quite so tiny,"" Mrs Johnson says. There was talk of Salford City Council turning it into some sort of museum when it came on the market in 2014, but that didn't happen. Instead, the Johnson family bought it - partly because of the Lowry connection, but mainly because its size suited their family, and it's down the road from the Swinton Palais, a gem of a dancehall that Mr Johnson runs. Was there any trace of the artist left when they moved in? ""His walking stick was here,"" Mr Johnson says. No sketches under the wallpaper? ""No, nothing. It's been knocked about too much."" Some of the original features - like doors, skirting boards and coving - are still there. ""He might not approve of the colour scheme,"" Mrs Johnson says. Much of the film takes place in Mrs Lowry's bedroom, which is now occupied by the Johnsons' teenage daughter. Her metal bedstead is eerily similar to Mrs Lowry's, which is depicted in a painting LS Lowry completed a year after his mother's death. Mrs Johnson says her daughter unwittingly chose a replica: ""I didn't say anything, and later when she chose it and she'd assembled it, I showed her the painting of the original and she went, 'Ooh! How spooky is that!'"" The film's writer Martyn Hesford grew up around the corner from the house. The artist had moved out by that time, but he remained a local legend. ""When I was 10 or 12, I would often stand outside the house and look up into the attic and think, all those paintings came from there,"" Hesford says. ""And I imagined the conversations he might have had with his mother."" Hesford's mother worked in the factory over the road from the Lowrys' house, but it was his aunt who introduced him to Lowry's work at an exhibition in Salford. ""My auntie Brenda took me to Peel Park to see the paintings when I was about six, and that was my introduction to art for the first time, which opened my eyes. And suddenly Salford wasn't just cobbled streets with pigeons. Weeds became coloured flowers, and chimney towers became dragons' breath."" In May, Steve and Abigail Johnson launched a crowdfunding campaign to place a statue of LS Lowry at the front of their house and create a memorial garden. They are hoping the film, which had its premiere at The Lowry arts centre in Salford on Tuesday, will spur interest in the plan. They have also had a new plaque made. ""We've not put it up yet because we were thinking, would it be safe?"" Mr Johnson says. ""Do we need [security] cameras up there? And we're thinking about doing the front garden and everything. So we're going to do it all together. ""It does deem a shame there's no recognition of him in the place where he did everything."" Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

"By Kev GeogheganEntertainment reporter, BBC News Singers Laura Mvula and Maverick Sabre, rappers Wretch 32 and Fazer, and newcomers Lady Leshurr and Jacob Banks were accompanied by the BBC Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Jules Buckley. The event, which was broadcast on BBC Radio 1, 3 and 1Xtra, mixed classical music with grime, rap, soul and R&B. The Proms have tried to reach out to a younger audience in recent years. Events have included the Doctor Who Prom, which this year celebrated the TV show's 50th anniversary. London-born Sabre had the unenviable task of opening the event but won over the crowd with his soaring soul-tinged vocals. If some of the regular Prom-goers at first didn't quite know what to make of the sounds, they were forced to give over to the sheer exuberance of the young performers. Soul singer-songwriter Mvula, 27, showed off her star quality as she performed several tracks from her debut album Sing to The Moon. A particular highlight was the haunting ballad Father, Father in which she was backed by a lush string arrangement. During rehearsals, she revealed that it was not her first time performing at the Proms. ""I was probably 14 playing in the school proms, in the orchestra, which I loved doing,"" she said. ""It was such a special moment, coming down to London on the coach was unreal and I remember we were playing Harry Potter music, which if you know it, the violin part is very hard. ""In the Royal Albert Hall, you can hear everything so I was super nervous, my fingers were sweating on the strings but I thought it was a once in a lifetime, I didn't think I would ever come back to do my own stuff. ""It's pretty incredible."" Mvula, whose album showed off her musical abilities - backed by a degree in composition from the Birmingham Conservatoire - said her road manager had warned her not to get too comfortable playing with a full orchestra. ""I'm afraid the first thing I was told was 'don't get any ideas', so I've just been soaking it up these few days and maybe one day we'll have our own."" The Urban Classic Prom uncovered two future stars in the shape of Birmingham-raised Leshurr and fellow Midlands singer Banks. Diminutive 24-year-old Leshurr was a ball of energy and her fast-flowing verses and constant badgering of the crowd to make some noise were incredibly effective. Possessed of a rich soulful voice, Banks proved to be a confident performer on his solo work and in a duet with Wretch 32. The Tottenham rapper's track Traktor was given a dark, epic feel by the orchestra under conductor Buckley. Wretch 32 admitted that his lack of classical training had led to a different method of recording and playing music. ""It's funny to see how we do things,"" the 28-year-old rapper said. ""Because, with my band, we just go with a feeling but when I came here it's like paperwork and for me, it's just trying to get it to meet in the middle. ""These guys can play but it's just about capturing the feeling which is difficult to get from the paper. I'm the type of person who couldn't tell you what scale to use, but if you played it to me, I'd say: 'Yeah, that feels right'."" Rehearsals for the show took place at the BBC's Maida vale studios - home to the 90-piece BBC Symphony Orchestra and the BBC Radiophonic Workshop. Buckley said: ""It always takes about 24 hours for everybody to get used to the environment and for the orchestral players to get used to the nature of the grooves and the basslines. For the rappers it may be the first time they've experienced a live orchestra."" Buckley also admitted that perhaps the term classical music still carries a stigma for young people. ""When I was at school, my friend was like: 'Oh yeah, classical music is all elitist.' But the thing is, that this is completely untrue and I think these kind of projects go some way to show people in a really relaxed way how accessible it is to get in and see an orchestra or an opera or a ballet."" As if to prove the point, rapper Fazer, from the group NDubz had worked with a group of young musicians who made their debut at the Proms. Seven Chapters, as they were called, lived up to their part of the bargain with an energetic performance. Speaking to mark the 70th birthday of Radio 3's Composer of the Week programme earlier this month, its host Donald Macleod said he was concerned about whether the classical music world was doing enough to bring a young crowd in. ""It is a huge worry when you go to concerts. I'm now a man of a certain age with white hair and when you look at a sea of white hair all around you, it is kind of depressing,"" he said. 'Music doesn't have limits' He added that the price of attending a classical concert could be prohibitive for younger people, though the Proms has to an extent addressed that, offering cheap tickets on the night at the box office. Mvula, who worked as a substitute teacher in the Midlands prior to signing her record contract said she hoped the mix of music is something her former pupils would have engaged with. ""If this concert promotes some kind of accessibility, then that's cool. ""I have problems labelling music because creatively I like to think that music doesn't have limits - I love all of the music that's been performed in this concert. ""Stereotypes exist everywhere and I know that if I was to ask my mum about dubstep or R&B she'd probably have pre-conceived ideas. ""But she likes my music, which could be called soul, and that just shows the problem that labelling music can cause. I think you just have to come and experience it.""",A cast of rising British urban music stars brought the Royal Albert Hall to its feet at the first BBC Urban Proms.
"The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC) has written to director Clint Eastwood and star Bradley Cooper. Their film is based on US soldier Chris Kyle's service in Iraq from 2003-09. The ADC said a ""majority of the violent threats we have seen over the past few days are result of how Arab and Muslims are depicted in American Sniper"". The organisation, which describes itself as the largest Arab civil rights organisation in the US, said it had collected ""hundreds of violent messages targeting Arab and Muslim Americans from movie-goers"", mainly from Facebook and Twitter. The letter asked Eastwood and Cooper to speak out against such messages ""in an effort to reduce the hateful rhetoric"". ""Your visibility, influence, and connection to the film would be a tremendous force in drawing attention to and lessening the serious dangers facing the respective communities,"" ADC president Samer Khalaf wrote. Jack Horner, a spokesman for the Warner Bros film studio, which released the film, told the Reuters news agency that the company ""denounces any violent, anti-Muslim rhetoric, including that which has been attributed to viewers"" of the film. He added: ""Hate and bigotry have no place in the important dialogue that this picture has generated about the veteran experience."" Spokespeople for Eastwood and Cooper had no immediate response to requests for comment, Reuters news agency reported. American Sniper has been a major hit in North America, exceeding box office predictions by taking $90m (£59m) in its opening weekend - a record for a January release. It also has six Oscar nominations. Film controversy But it has caused controversy. Some have hailed its portrayal of Kyle as a war hero, but others have criticised it for glorifying violence and for Kyle's attitude towards his victims. Kyle, a Navy Seal, served four tours of duty in Iraq and killed more than 160 people, making him the most deadly sniper in American history. The film is based on his book, also titled American Sniper, in which he claimed to have no regrets and referred to those he killed as ""savages"". Kyle was killed in February 2013 on a firing range in his home state of Texas.","The release of the film American Sniper has led to an increase in threats against Muslims in the US, according to an Arab-American civil rights group."

"By John McKieBBC News His third film, 12 Years A Slave, has been a big success this awards season - but he is not the only Young British Artist turned film-maker. Another is in the final stages of shooting what may well be the most talked about movie of 2015. Sam Taylor-Johnson (previously known as Sam Taylor-Wood) is adapting EL James' best-seller Fifty Shades of Grey, expected in cinemas 12 months from now. At this year's Sundance festival, one of the best critical receptions was for a full-length film of a fictional day in the life of Nick Cave, 20,000 Days On Earth, co-directed by artists and ex-Goldsmiths College students Iain Forsyth and Jane Pollard. ""The trend is there and is certainly substantial,"" says Nick James, editor of film magazine Sight and Sound. ""Producers have had to go searching for fresh visions and they have looked to artists who are interested in moving image."" James believes artists bring a different approach behind the camera. ""There are shots in 12 Years A Slave that Steven Spielberg would never hold for that long and that comes from a particular visual sensibility."" ""Lots of artists are now making long films, and a lot of them are brilliant,"" enthuses Ralph Rugoff, Director of the Hayward Gallery, which has exhibited shows by Taylor-Wood and McQueen, as well as 1996 Turner Prize winner Douglas Gordon. In 2006, Gordon co-directed with fellow artist Philippe Parreno the full-length documentary Zidane, starring the French World Cup winner and David Beckham. He was the first video artist to win the Turner Prize. Three years later, his friend McQueen won for an installation based around a Buster Keaton film. He has fond memories of McQueen. ""Steve turned up when I won in full Highland outfit,"" recalls Gordon. ""No-one was more surprised than I was."" Gordon's recent collaboration with actor James Franco on a re-versioning of Psycho at London's Pace Gallery was based, in part, on his own Turner Prize-winning installation 24 Hour Psycho. It bolstered his belief that there is a growing respect in the film community for contemporary artists. ""There's a wee bit of a gap that has closed down. I remember seeing Billy Wilder being led around this exhibition of conceptual film. He was being really dismissive and saying 'A 12-year-old could do that.' You wouldn't get that attitude from George Clooney, Brad Pitt or James Franco. ""Cate Blanchett was in my [Berlin] studio a few weeks ago and you don't have to start at the beginning with these people. I don't know if, say, John Wayne or Katherine Hepburn would have been particularly OK walking round the studio."" Gordon currently has two long-form film projects. One is based on Don DeLillo's novel Point Omega, another is the remarkable life story of legendary Lithuanian film-maker Jonas Mekas, 91, who escaped imprisonment in labour camps during World War Two. ""Some producers realise that artists are quite patient,"" he reasons. ""[Zinedine] Zidane and Jonas Mekas realised I wanted to do a different type of feature. ""I like to think they based their decision to work with me purely on my charm and wit, but they probably looked at my work too."" McQueen's success with 12 Years A Slave is due in part to another movie star, who serves as one of its producers and co-stars. The artist's Turner Prize win brought him to the attention of Channel 4, who contributed some of the £1.5 million required to make his first picture, the Bafta-winning Hunger. Admirers of that film included Brad Pitt, whose production company stepped up to help finance 12 Years a Slave. Sam Taylor-Johnson's work was equally admired by many big stars before her 2009 debut feature Nowhere Boy, starring her now-husband Aaron Johnson as John Lennon. Sir Elton John personally asked Taylor-Johnson to direct the video for his song I Want Love, which starred Robert Downey Jr. The last two Turner Prize winners worked in video installation and 2013 winner Laure Prouvost can see why artists are becoming successful film directors. ""The film industry has locked itself into quite a straight narrative,"" she tells the BBC, ""and it can be predictable. So artists might come at things from a different angle. They might come with an image."" Advances in technology are also helping conceptual artists realise visions on the big screen. ""Now moving images are something you see in art galleries as well as cinemas,"" says Rugoff. ""We watch moving images in so many different ways, even on our mobile phones. ""So many artists are exploring the possibility of multi-screen storytelling. Part of that is because people are looking at three things at once, their laptop, their TV and their phone and so I hope that's the next step. Longer versions of Vines may happen."" McQueen and Taylor-Johnson breaking through into mainstream Hollywood are still seen by many as exceptions to the rule. ""Film-making is a special skill,"" says Rugoff, ""and what Steve McQueen and Julian Schnabel have done is display different skills - like a boxer suddenly taking up football."" Laure Prouvost sounds another note of caution, about the film world's infamous politics. ""I can see why artists are attracted to working on that scale but it's extremely hard to achieve something in the film industry. You have to articulate your voice quite differently from how an artist might work. There is more interference."" Ralph Rugoff still sees the main direction of travel for artists being not to film, but music. ""Artists seem to have better luck going into rock'n'roll - look at [former art school students] Blur, Bowie, Franz Ferdinand, Roxy Music...it's a pretty extensive list.""",Turner prize winner Steve McQueen could pick up the biggest prize in the film world at the Oscars on Sunday.
"By Ian YoungsArts reporter, BBC News Plays at The Merlin theatre in Frome, Somerset, and the Brewhouse in Taunton, rarely register on the national radar. But the venues have been of interest to the arts world of late. They could be the canaries in the coal mine, having lost all regular Arts Council England and most local council funding. The Brewhouse has fallen off its perch, having gone into administration in February. The Merlin is still going but with a changed set of shows in order to boost box office takings. ""We've tried not to change it too drastically,"" its director Claudia Pepler says. ""But we've not been able to do the more challenging or riskier work - we've had to go to safer companies and safer, more classical shows so our audiences grow."" The outlook for arts funding across the rest of the country is not so drastic as in Somerset. But a recent survey of 26 theatre companies by playwright Fin Kennedy found that more than half had cut back on shows, new writing and cast sizes. ""If you look at the programming across the reps, I think you'll see an upsurge in dead writers who are safely out of copyright,"" says Nicholas Wood of the Writers' Guild of Great Britain. ""You'll see an upsurge in the most popular GCSE texts - there are quite a lot of Of Mice And Men knocking around - and a lot of popular [shows], a lot of spectacular. But not a great deal of new writing."" He predicts a ""dumbing down"" in order to get bums on seats, warning that the diet must include more than proven hits. ""If the only thing that you can see is Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, no matter how high the production values are on its umpteenth tour, that is lessening the opportunities for the people who are creating work, performing and coming along to see it."" But is a more commercial outlook such a bad thing? Not necessarily, according to Philip Booth of the free market think-tank the Institute of Economic Affairs. There is nothing wrong with creating works with wide appeal, he says: ""I'm sure you'll get more popular and populist art if it's funded privately, but I don't think you'll necessarily get worse art."" Britain was by no means ""a nation of philistines"" before the government started funding the arts in 1946, Mr Booth says. ""England's rich cultural tradition developed free of government funding and art had to appeal to the people. In the 16th Century, British theatre developed to much public acclaim precisely because it had to appeal to the public. ""In his day, Shakespeare was commercially successful and popular."" That may be true, but Leila Jancovich, a senior lecturer in cultural policy and arts management at Leeds Metropolitan University, argues that most artforms were restricted to the elite before governments attempted to widen access. ""A lot of classical music was played at court, or art was commissioned by wealthy people for their own private collections,"" she says. ""Art might still exist, but whether anyone sees it is another matter."" The prospect of smaller cast sizes in theatres is frequently raised as one likely consequence of a budget squeeze. Funding cuts ""might mean slightly less rich actors, poor things"" says Daily Mail theatre critic Quentin Letts, who points to a rising trend in actors playing more than one role in a show. Lower production budgets do not necessarily mean worse art, he believes. ""The artistic urge is still going to be there, and the artistic urge finds a way of getting out."" Rod Dixon, artistic director of the Leeds-based radical theatre company Red Ladder, is among those facing the prospect of staging smaller shows. ""My concern is that a lot of companies like ours will be touring two-handers or single-person shows and the public will get fed up of them. They want the depth and variety and colour that they get at the moment."" The company's hits have included the satire Big Society! starring Phill Jupitus. But Mr Dixon has a greater concern to do with the government's attempts to boost philanthropy as grants decline. ""My fear about philanthropy is that the wealthy will get the art that they find entertaining or engaging,"" he says. ""The wealthy will get the art that maintains the status quo and won't pay for anything that shows any kind of dissent. ""The history of artistic dissent is strong in this country. It'll go underground, but we want mainstream art to have a critical and dissenting voice because that's healthy for democracy."" Leila Jancovich of Leeds Metropolitan University believes the cuts have so far been felt most severely by organisations that ""absolutely could never be commercial"". ""They're the more participatory and grassroots activities - everything from free community festivals in areas that don't have much other arts provision to arts organisations working with hard-to-reach groups,"" she says. ""The big institutions, by and large, will survive. But the interesting, experimental art is what would suffer, rather than this same diet of plays that are repeated over and over again."" 'Coercive' philanthropy In the visual art world, cuts are likely to mean a drop in the numbers of temporary exhibitions and events, according to David Lee, editor of The Jackdaw magazine. But he adds: ""Are we going to see a great effect on museums? The answer is no. ""If I go, for example, to the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery, if there isn't a temporary exhibition on, it doesn't bother me. There are so many glories in the permanent collections of many museums and galleries that it's almost an irrelevance."" Any increased reliance on philanthropic donations is a worry in the visual art world too. At a recent conference, Liverpool Biennial artistic director Sally Tallant warned that ""all philanthropy is coercive"". ""The longer you work in the arts, [you realise] absolutely nobody gives you something for nothing - including the government,"" she says. Her festival and other serious organisations would not let donors influence the art they choose, she says - but sponsors will only fork out if they like the work. ""Maybe there are some artists who are not well known, whose work is very risky, who perhaps [donors] might find it difficult to support,"" she says. ""It shouldn't be that you make a decision not to show them, but then, how do you fund those projects?"" She stresses that the UK is not yet in the situation where donors dictate artistic programming. ""That's why it's important that we don't get ourselves into that situation. We're one of the places in the world where creativity's really thriving. We should be proud of that.""","Like many parts of life, theatres, galleries and other arts organisations are feeling the squeeze from funding cuts.

"Guidelines published on Thursday said BBC News employees shouldn't attend marches about ""controversial issues"". Some were reportedly told that meant they may not be able to join Pride events, which support LGBTQ+ rights. But Mr Davie has said journalists could attend if they were not ""taking a stand on politicised or contested issues"". Aimed at maintaining the broadcaster's impartiality, the new guidance said employees should not ""express a personal opinion on matters of public policy, politics, or controversial subjects"". Mr Davie told staff on Friday: ""There is no ban on attending Pride parades. ""The guidance that we published yesterday made it very clear that staff outside of news and current affairs and factual journalism may attend marches, demonstrations and protests as private individuals... ""There are different considerations for staff who work in news and current affairs and factual journalism (and senior leaders) but I want to be clear that there is no issue for these staff attending community events that are clearly celebratory or commemorative and do not compromise perceptions of their impartiality. ""If news and current affairs staff are participating in such events they must be mindful of ensuring that they do not get involved in matters which could be deemed political or controversial. There is no ban on these staff attending Pride events. ""Attending Pride parades is possible within the guidelines, but due care needs to be given to the guidance and staff need to ensure that they are not seen to be taking a stand on politicised or contested issues."" 'Created ambiguity' Mr Davie said commentary in the press and online on Thursday saying staff would be banned from Pride was ""inaccurate"". BBC LGBT correspondent Ben Hunte said many people on social media were left ""questioning why it took so long for the BBC to provide this reassurance to staff and audiences"". Hunte said: ""LGBT staff at the BBC have told me that they are concerned that this statement has come far too late to undo the anger, resentment and confusion that was allowed to take hold for nearly 18 hours."" In response to Mr Davie's statement, the organisers of Pride In London said Mr Davie's message had ""created ambiguity"". The event's director of communications Rhammel O'Dwyer-Afflick told the PA news agency: ""While we welcome the news that all BBC staff can attend Pride events, we are concerned that the handling of this announcement and the policy itself have created ambiguity about the degree to which BBC employees can publicly show support for the rights of LGBT+ people. ""The rights of trans people, queer people of colour and black trans individuals in particular should not be up for debate. ""All BBC employees should be able to freely attend events in support of trans communities, such as Pride, as well as Black Lives Matter protests without fear of repercussions."" 'Much distress' Broadcasting union Bectu said the new rules had caused ""confusion and distress"". Bectu head Philippa Childs said: ""We are frankly dismayed that unions were not properly consulted prior to the publication of such an important document. ""There is a huge amount of confusion and conjecture regarding what the guidelines mean and this is causing much distress amongst the Bectu membership and the workforce more generally."" The National Union of Journalists (NUJ) has called for an urgent meeting with Mr Davie to discuss the guidelines. General secretary Michelle Stanistreet said she wanted to ""address our members' concerns about the changes which could constrain individuals' ability to meaningfully participate and engage in issues that matter to them - whether that's in their trade union, their communities or in events such as Pride"". The new guidance also covers the use of social media, whether professionally or personally, in an attempt to avoid perceptions of bias; and said a new register of external and corporate work done by presenters, and how much they were paid, would be established.

"By Mark SavageBBC Music reporter Forty-seven plaques will be unveiled on BBC Music Day this Thursday, recognising pioneering musicians and music venues around the UK. Motorhead star Lemmy will be celebrated at Port Vale FC, which has adopted Ace Of Spades as its unofficial anthem. Superstar tenor Alfie Boe will also receive an award in his hometown. His plaque will be unveiled at Marine Hall in Fleetwood, where the musician gave his first public performance at the age of 14. ""I can't believe that this is happening,"" he told the BBC. ""You walk past so many blue plaques on buildings and you never suspect you're going to be one of them. I'm just blown away by it, I really am."" Billy Bragg will unveil a plaque for David Bowie at the site of the Trident Studios in Soho, where the star recorded his multi-million selling albums Hunky Dory and The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust. Bowie's backing band The Spiders From Mars will also be commemorated at Hull's Paragon Station - from where they took the train to meet the Thin White Duke in the 1970s. Other notable honourees include: You can see the full list of recipients on the BBC Music Day website. Q&A with Alfie Boe Congratulations on being awarded a blue plaque. How does it feel? I really can't get over it. It's an amazing thing to happen to me, and I'm not taking it lightly. I'm very, very, very honoured. The plaque will be nailed to the wall of Marine Hall, where you played your first gig. What do you remember of that night? I was a 14-year-old kid and I was very scared, very nervous. We were doing something called Songs from the Shows, and I was asked to sing Bring Him Home from Les Miserables. I never would have thought that, years later, that would have been a role I would have played on Broadway and in the West End. Have you been back to the venue since? I've played there a number of times. It's a place that I hold very close to my heart. It's a little gem of a theatre. I even worked there as stage crew and then in the waiting staff for all the banquets and balls they used to have. I bet they're not putting that on the plaque. ""Alfie Boe stacked chairs here""! Who are you bringing to the unveiling ceremony? Obviously my family will be there and lots of old friends from Fleetwood. I think Michael [Ball] is coming and joining me on the day, as well. I can't thank him enough for taking time out and spending the day in my hometown. I'll show him around and we'll get a bag of chips on the seafront. And when the event's over, you can stack the chairs. Exactly. Stack the chairs and mop the floor, just like old times. BBC Music Day is an annual celebration that aims ""to unite communities and generations through their love of music"". More than 200 events will take place this Thursday, including a co-ordinated, country-wide bell-ringing performance at 19:00 BST. Schoolchildren in Bradford and Portsmouth will attempt to break world records in drumming and Tamboo Bamboo, while the indie band The Courteeners will visit Manchester Royal Infirmary to explore the impact of music therapy on patients. BBC Radio 3 will broadcast five dramatic monologues by new writers about the power of classical music, performed by actors including Liam Neeson and Julie Hesmondhalgh. And The Charlatans will play an exclusive concert for BBC Radio Scotland and BBC 6 Music.

"By Mark SavageBBC music reporter The closing track on her second album, Punisher, it starts out as a subdued break-up ballad but builds to an explosive climax, as the singer stares down Armageddon and unexpectedly accepts it. ""I'm not afraid to disappear,"" she sings, as the guitars churn and strings swirl - before the song ends with a ragged, throat-shredding scream. ""It's about being at peace with the end of the world,"" the singer explained in her own breakdown of the record. ""Instead of waking up every day during the apocalypse - like, right now - and being heartbroken, you're just kind of like, 'OK, what can I do today?'. Taking it one day at a time, instead of giving up."" Like many of the songs on Punisher, I Know The End juxtaposes Bridgers' personal devastations with those of the world crumbling outside her front door. She rebukes her estranged father (Kyoto), cries crocodile tears in a car (Savior Complex), mourns her lack of faith (Chinese Satellite) and throws in the occasional comic aside. ""I swear I'm not angry, that's just my face,"" she deadpans on the title track. The emotionally-charged, lyrically astute writing has seen Bridgers nominated for four Grammy Awards, including best new artist; while Savior Complex was recently rewarded with a darkly comedic video, directed by Fleabag's Phoebe Waller-Bridge. The 26-year-old called up the BBC from her home in LA to discuss the making of the album, learning to drive a tractor and the time she stalked James Blake. Any artist who starts making a new album hopes it will reach a bigger audience than the last one. What's it like when that actually happens? Um, it's awesome - although I haven't seen very many people, so it's all pretty hypothetical to me. I guess one of the ways you quantify the audience growing is by seeing them at gigs - which you haven't been able to do. Definitely. The only real show I played for this record was at the Roundhouse [in London] last year, so I definitely miss it. I feel like songs get better as they go along on the tour. It's weird to be stuck in time. Punisher is your first solo album since 2017. At what point did you sit down and think, 'OK, these are the 10 songs I want to concentrate on?' Ah, I don't really do that. When I finished Punisher, those were the only 10 songs that I had written. I don't have extra material at any point, which is pretty weird. I don't know anybody else who works like that. Do you spend a lot of time refining the songs, then? Yeah, I can write a song in 20 minutes, but it's gonna be not that good. So I like writing a song in 20 minutes, ignoring it for three months, then working on it for three months. You have to trick your brain into finding the rhymes, or defining what you actually want to say. So yeah, the 15th version of everything is always the best. How do you protect the original, emotional spark if you're revising a song 15 times? Well, here's an example. My producer Tony called me yesterday and he talked about how little I sound on Motion Sickness [from Bridgers' first album, Stranger In The Alps]. That was a song I wrote as a ballad, and then we turned it into a rock song - but I didn't really know how to sing like that yet, so the vocal is really chopped up and I'm so out of breath. But now, when I sing that song on tour, I can sing it exactly like the record. So I feel like recording is actually part of the writing process. The spark continues to grow, for me, if you're proud of something. On Chinese Satellite, you sing about your lack of faith. How do you think this year would have been different if you had a belief? I don't know. Maybe it would be like going to sleep at night knowing that you have a parent who cares about you, instead of just feeling like nothing means anything and good people get sick and die for no reason. That's kind of an exhausting weight. What rituals did you develop to help you get through lockdown? I think the best days were when I could go outside, but there were months where going outside was too scary. Even now, it's the worst [infection rate] there has ever been in the US, and people still aren't wearing masks - and I live in Los Angeles, which is supposed to be a liberal bubble. I bought a treadmill, so I didn't have to leave the house, and I [started] making my house cosy and making my bed every day, which I'm not super great at. This is my only advice: If you live alone, clean your house the way you do when your crush is coming over. Is tidying up for your crush a higher standard of cleanliness than when your mum visits? Oh, a thousand times. My mom is gonna think I don't clean things appropriately, no matter what, so I just kind of don't bother. Actually, my mom - this is very sweet - her gift to me when I come back from tour is she'll clean my house and get me groceries and flowers. It's the best possible coming home present. It's like someone clean has been living here! I Know The End has become a lockdown anthem. Did it really start out as a metal song? Well, I had had that whole beginning of the song for a really long time, and it was just too depressing. And then I had the idea to end the record in a super metal way and so I just did both. I was like, 'Oh, maybe the depressing song will be great for this crazy outro'. What was it like recording the scream? It was awesome. Actually, I asked Connor Oberst to teach me how to scream and he was like, 'What do you mean? You just do it'. So I just did it, and my voice was sore for three days but it was so fun. I highly recommend it. Have you used the scream subsequently? In a pillow. But that's a little bit more depressing. In the video you had to scream into an older woman's face. How awkward was that? Oh my god! I always sing in music videos, because I think it looks really unnatural when you're mouthing the words. You don't breathe at the right time, you don't move your mouth in the right way. But for that one I had to whisper. I was like, 'Sorry, Lily. Ahgghgghgggh!' Am I right that Punisher is a jokey term musicians use to describe over-zealous fans? Kind of, but a little bit sweeter than that. Like, anybody can be punished. It's not specific to being famous or successful. If your aunt brings a weird friend to the Christmas party, and she talks to you about her hip replacement for, like, 45 minutes, that's being punished. It's someone who's not aware that you don't care what they're talking about. I love meeting fans who have interesting things to say, or are funny and charming and sweet, or make me a friendship bracelet or whatever. But I've also had dudes come up to me and be like, 'You know, you should sing louder'. That's being punished. I even have a little ""punisher wave"" that some of my friends know about, where it's like a signal to come and save me. Have you ever been the punisher? Oh, totally. I punished James Blake once when I was a teenager. I waited by the backstage door at the Troubadour and I had the most boring things to say. I was like, 'Are you gonna play Coachella?' And he's like, 'Maybe. I don't know'. And then I said, 'What are you up to now?', like I was his friend, and not some random girl who was stopping him from going to bed. What did he do? Oh, he was super nice. He took a picture with me, it was great. Speaking of stalking... you wrote a fan letter to Phoebe Waller-Bridge asking her to direct the video for Savior Complex. What was in that email? It was probably very doting. I deleted a lot of apologies from it... but she's the sweetest, so I shouldn't have been afraid. What's your favourite memory of making it? Honestly, just how easy everybody was. I paid my rent during my first record by appearing in commercials and, at one audition, someone told me he could probably sleep with me 'if he wanted'. So I had this perception that the industry is gross, and everybody famous is gross. But everyone on this video was so sweet. Like, hanging out with the guy who taught me how to drive the tractor was just a blast. It changed my perspective on fame being a curse. And now you've got those tractor skills to fall back on if the music career fails. Exactly. On Punisher, you joke about plagiarising Elliott Smith - I think the line is, 'either I'm careless or I want to get caught'. Is that a genuine fear? Yes, it's not even plagiarism. It's an even more elusive fear of people saying, 'We realised what your trick is, and that you tricked everybody into liking it, and you'll never make anything good again'. A bit like imposter syndrome. It is imposter syndrome. It's funny, I work really hard and I have imposter syndrome. But a very successful lawyer who got an internship at a law firm because of his dad can be like, 'I'm the best at my job and that's why I'm here'. I feel like imposter syndrome is brought upon the worst people. I think it goes hand in hand with talent, because being creative involves being able to question yourself. Maybe, but then you look at someone like Jerry Lee Lewis or Morrissey, who's like, 'I'm God!' You've just been nominated for best new artist at the Grammys. How does that feel? This sounds corny and like something someone would say if their PR person gave them media training on how to not sound like a loser - but it's already an achievement for me. When I played to 100 people at St Pancras in London, I cried after the show [because] I was so grateful. So every level has felt amazing and unexpected. I loved the tweet where you asked if you and Megan Thee Stallion could get swords and fight for the trophy. I just think that's funny. Like, we are not battling. Not that I want to jinx myself here but Megan Thee Stallion is the best new artist, by far. Kyoto is also up for best rock performance - and all the nominees in that category are female for the first time. What do you make of that? It's about time, but it's very cool because I also just agree [with the nominations]. I don't think it's virtue signalling because I can't think of a male rock album this year that really shook me up. So I was like, 'Yes, yes, yes, yes!' It's a total honour to be nominated with all those people. Apart from the Grammys, what are you looking forward to? Will you get to tour next year? I hope so. I'm sick of cancelled plans at this point. I think we rescheduled the tour four times before we just stopped. I just hope to record and do random stuff until it's over.

Up yours, I thought.""

"The crowd erupted into cheers as Cave introduced his fellow Australian, with the pair embracing before the duet. Where The Wild Roses Grow, a number 11 hit in 1995, remains one of the most left-field moments of Kylie's career. The singers first sang it together at the Feile Festival in Cork in 1995. They gave another rendition at the T in the Park festival in Scotland that year - but did not appear together on stage for several years before Kylie popped up for the encore of Cave's show at London's Koko club in 2013. It is by far the most successful single for Cave and his band. Written by Cave himself, it originally appeared on their 1996 album Murder Ballads, a collection of songs centred on the subject of killing. After watching the performance, at the All Points East festival in Victoria Park in east London, Twitter user @MrAlexLawson described the pair as ""spectacular"" while @hayleybowcock said her life was now ""complete"". Though the song never appeared in one of Kylie's studio albums, it is included on three of her greatest hits compilations and is credited with helping transform her public image from novelty pop star to serious musician in the years after she ended her association with pop hitmakers Stock, Aitken and Waterman. The gloomy video for the song famously featured Kylie, complete with dark red hair, singing while submerged in a river and reliving the details of her character Eliza Day's murder. Cave also performed hits including Into My Arms and One More Time With Feeling as the festival closed on Sunday night before a stage invasion at the culmination of his performance. Earlier at the festival, Patti Smith, Courtney Barnett, St Vincent, Marika Hackman and Nadine Shah had performed.",Kylie Minogue has surprised fans at a London festival by joining Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds on stage for a rare live performance of their 1995 duet Where The Wild Roses Grow.
"By Mark SavageBBC Music reporter The 20-year-old, who comes from Walsall in the West Midlands, beat two other newcomers, Mabel and Stefflon Don, to the prize. The award, which recognises ""the future stars of British recording talent"", has previously gone to Adele, Emeli Sande and last year's winner, Rag N Bone Man. ""This is such a special way to end the year,"" said Smith. The singer, who took fourth place on the BBC Sound of 2017, was working in a Starbucks less than two years ago when she posted her first single, Blue Lights, on SoundCloud. A soulful, semi-autobiographical look at her childhood in the West Midlands (it references the number four bus she used to catch home) it quickly earned shout-outs from Stormzy, Skrillex and Drake - who put her on his More Life mixtape earlier this year, alongside the likes of Kanye West and Young Thug. The Canadian R&B star also invited Smith on stage during his concerts at London's O2 arena and the Barclays Center in Birmingham. After the second show, the pair popped out to a local Co-Op to buy sweets, to the surprise of fans. This year, she has released two smooth-but-streetwise singles, Teenage Fantasy and On My Mind, both of which were named ""Hottest Record In The World"" by BBC Radio 1's Annie Mac. Smith said she ""couldn't believe"" she'd been given the Critics' Choice award, which is chosen by a panel of music industry experts - including critics, record label employees and the heads of the UK's biggest radio stations.

Agnew suggested that he would be ""sacked"" if he followed the Lineker's example. But, responding to the criticism on Thursday evening, the former footballer wrote: ""I'll continue to tweet what I like and if folk disagree with me then so be it."" What did Gary Lineker tweet? On Wednesday, Lineker posted a thread of tweets as the Conservatives held a no-confidence vote in Theresa May. He also indirectly criticised Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, implying the party should be ahead in the polls given the current political uncertainty. Why does Jonathan Agnew object? Aggers, as he's known, suggested BBC presenters should abide by the corporation's standards on impartiality.

Another section reads: ""BBC staff and regular BBC presenters or reporters associated with news or public policy-related output may offer professional judgements rooted in evidence. ""However, it is not normally appropriate for them to present or write personal view programmes and content on public policy, on matters of political or industrial controversy, or on 'controversial subjects' in any area."" What is Lineker's defence? Lineker falls into a slightly different category both because of his contract and his role as a sport presenter. A BBC spokesperson said: ""Gary is not involved in any news or political output for the BBC. ""As such, any expression of his personal political views does not affect the BBC's impartiality."" Lineker only presents sports coverage for the corporation, and is not a journalist or involved in news coverage or commentary.

"Lasting over seven hours, the memorial was both mournful and celebratory, with the crowd breaking into a spontaneous dance of praise at one point. Focusing on Franklin's gospel roots, the service featured music from Ariana Grande and Chaka Khan, with Stevie Wonder delivering an emotional finale. Franklin died earlier this month of pancreatic cancer at the age of 76. Her final send-off involved 100 pink Cadillacs, a gold-plated coffin, three presidential tributes and eulogies by more than a dozen preachers. They remembered her not just as the Queen of Soul, but as an aunt, grandmother, friend, civil rights activist and icon of black womanhood. ""The reason that we are here today is because of love. Because of how much we love this woman,"" said Stevie Wonder, who led the congregation in a rendition of his song As, which carries the refrain: ""I'll be loving you always"". ""One of my longest friends has gone home,"" added Motown star Smokey Robinson, who grew up with Franklin in Detroit. ""You're going to be one of the future voices in the choir of angels,"" he added, before breaking into an a capella rendition of his ballad Really Gonna Miss You. ""Aretha will be influencing others literally for centuries to come,"" said record label boss Clive Davis, who praised her ""once-in-a-lifetime voice"". Pop star Ariana Grande sang one of Franklin's signature songs (You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman but elsewhere, the service was like a Who's Who of gospel with powerful and uplifting performances from The Williams Brothers, Vanessa Bell Armstrong and The Clark Sisters. Jennifer Hudson's stirring rendition of Amazing Grace; and Gladys Knight's version of You'll Never Walk Alone, in particular, drew mourners to their feet, with others raising their arms in praise. Franklin's son Edward also sang Marvin Gaye's Mercy, Mercy Me; while her niece Cristal remembered the aunt who ""taught me bad shopping habits"" and ""chartered a bus so our family could go to President Obama's inauguration"". Obama was unable to attend the funeral, but sent a speech to be read to the mourners. ""Through her voice, her own voice, Aretha lifted those of millions - empowering and inspiring the vulnerable, the downtrodden, and everyone who may have just needed a little love,"" read his message. George W Bush also sent a letter to Franklin's family; while Bill Clinton spoke from the pulpit, describing himself as an ""Aretha Franklin groupie"" and praising the star's work ethic. ""Yeah, she had the voice of a generation, maybe the voice of the century... but she also worked for years when nobody was paying particular attention. ""She lived with courage - not without fear but overcoming her fears. ""She lived with faith - not without failure but overcoming her failures. ""She lived with power - not without weakness, but overcoming her weaknesses. ""I just loved her."" Franklin's contribution to the civil rights movement - both spiritual and financial - was honoured by Rev. Al Sharpton, who said: ""She represented the best in our community and she fought for our community until the end. ""She gave us pride and she gave us a regal bar to reach. And that's why we're all here. We don't all agree on everything but we agree on Aretha."" He went on to criticise President Trump, whose initial tribute to Franklin two weeks ago said, ""she worked for me on numerous occasions"". ""No, she used to perform for you,"" scolded the pastor. ""Aretha never took orders from nobody but God."" At the funeral: Nada Tawfik, BBC North America reporter Outside of the Greater Grace Temple, there is an outpouring of love for the Queen of Soul. Aretha Franklin fans lined up hours before sunrise to get one of the 1,000 seats open to the public for her star-studded funeral. Many said that they never met her, but knew her intimately through her songs. Her music continues to move this city, people on the street, in their cars and in their homes have been playing and singing her songs loudly. In her 1985 hit single, ""Freeway of Love,"" Aretha Franklin sang about cruising around in a pink Cadillac. In her honour, the streets here were filled with more than 140 pink Cadillacs that will be part of the funeral procession. Dignitaries and legends may be attending her funeral, but it is the overwhelming admiration and gratitude of the public that underlines her impact on America. Earlier this week, Franklin's body lay in state at the Charles H Wright Museum of African American History - where she was dressed in a new outfit every day. For the funeral, she was clad in a sparkling full-length gold dress with sequined heels. Her body arrived at the Greater Grace Temple on Friday morning in the same white Cadillac that carried her father, Rev. CL Franklin in 1984; as well as civil rights activist Rosa Parks in 2005. The singer will be buried in a 24-carat, gold-plated casket made of solid bronze. The interior is finished with champagne velvet, and stitched with her name and her title, ""Queen of Soul"", in gold metallic thread. The funeral followed a tribute concert, starring The Four Tops, Angie Stone and Regina Belle on Thursday evening. Speaking during the memorial service, Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan announced the concert's riverside venue, Chene Park, would be renamed Aretha Franklin Park, so that ""performers from generations to come"" would be ""reminded they are performing at the home of the Queen of Soul"". In a musical career spanning seven decades, Franklin won 18 Grammys, and had 17 Top Ten US chart hits. She gave her final performance last November at a gala in New York held in aid of the Elton John Aids Foundation. In his speech, Robinson said the star would never be forgotten.

"It was a period that transformed the face of British theatre and cinema from the mid-1950s. He switched effortlessly between blustering roles, such as when he played Winston Churchill, and performances of great wit, charm and elegance. Powerfully built, he had the resonant voice beloved of earlier generations of stage actors. Albert Finney was born in Salford, Lancashire on 9 May 1936. His father, known as ""Honest Albert"", ran a bookmaking business and Finney never abandoned his working-class roots. ""It's part of you,"" he later said. ""It's in the blood really. Finney acquired a taste for acting while studying at Salford Grammar School and won a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (Rada). He worked first with Birmingham Repertory Theatre before moving on to the Old Vic and National Theatre. ""I was dead lucky,"" Finney recalled. ""It was one of the leading reps in the country."" His first London stage appearance was in 1958 in Jane Arden's The Party, which was directed by Charles Laughton, who also starred. Social alienation A year later, the young Finney was at Stratford where he replaced an ill Laurence Olivier in the role of Coriolanus. In 1960, he appeared alongside Olivier in his first film, The Entertainer, directed by Tony Richardson. Based on a play by John Osborne, it was an example of a new gritty style of British film-making that became known as kitchen-sink drama. Its heroes were invariably working-class, the backdrops often that of northern England, and it explored themes of social alienation. Finney's next film, Saturday Night and Sunday Morning, gave him a starring role as a young factory worker who was disillusioned with his lot. The plot, based on a novel by Alan Sillitoe, featured extramarital sex and abortion, earning it an X-certificate from the British Board of Film Censors. ""I remember, in terms of the sex,"" Finney told the Guardian in 1982, ""there were great discussions because the law then was you had to have one foot on the floor."" International star It also earned Finney the first of 13 Bafta nominations, this one for best British actor. He was approached to play Lawrence of Arabia in David Lean's film but, after going through a four-day screen test, Finney decided not to take the role that eventually went to Peter O'Toole. Instead, he teamed up with Tony Richardson again for Tom Jones, an adaptation of Henry Fielding's bawdy 18th Century novel. The film, which had an all-star cast, received 10 Oscar nominations, including one for Finney as best actor. In the event, he did not win, although the film did get four statuettes, including best picture. Tom Jones made Finney an international star and he was voted one of the top ten British actors of 1963 by cinema owners. But he refused to abandon the theatre. There was a Tony Award nomination for his performance in the title role of John Osborne's Luther, and another for A Day in the Death of Joe Egg. He also appeared in performances of Shakespeare's Much Ado About Nothing and Chekhov's The Cherry Orchard. Typecast In the 1967 film Charlie Bubbles, which Finney also directed, he played a writer returning to his northern roots after becoming successful in London. In one scene, Finney's character is pictured driving his gold Rolls Royce through the crumbling streets of his native Salford. He also proved he could sing, first in the title role of the 1970 musical film Scrooge and then in the 1982 film version of the Broadway musical Annie. In 1974, he played the pedantic Hercule Poirot in the film Murder on the Orient Express. Finney later complained that he was typecast in the role. ""People do think I weigh 300lb with a French accent."" Later he began to specialise in more ebullient characters. There was the fading actor-manager in The Dresser, opposite Tom Courtenay, which gained him another Oscar nomination. He also received nominations for Under the Volcano in 1984 and the 2000 film Erin Brockovich, although he never actually received a gold statuette or attended the awards ceremony. Powerful presence ""It's a long way to go for a party, sitting there for six hours not having a cigarette or a drink,"" he declared. ""It's a waste of time."" There was a live appearance as The Judge in Roger Waters' performance of Pink Floyd's The Wall in Berlin in July 1990. Finney turned in a powerful portrayal of Winston Churchill in the 2002 BBC production The Gathering Storm, which won him awards including a Bafta and an Emmy. He had a magnetic presence off screen too. His lovers included Joan Baez, Carly Simon, Billie Whitelaw, Jacqueline Bisset, Shelley Winters and Diana Quick. In 1957, he married Jane Wenham, with whom he had a son. The couple divorced just five years later. In 1970, he married the French actress Anouk Aimee. Later in life, he settled down with Penne Delmarche and admitted to only two vices - wine and horseracing. He owned several racehorses, stabled in America. ""I'm a born flirt and that will never stop, but I would take things no further. I am loyal and content."" He had kidney cancer diagnosed in 2007, and he disappeared from public view, but returned with roles in The Bourne Ultimatum and James Bond film Skyfall. Together with actors such as Courtenay, O'Toole and Alan Bates, Albert Finney helped transform the face of British theatre and cinema during its renaissance in the 1960s. He largely ignored the celebrity lifestyle and refused becoming CBE in 1980 and a knight in 2000. ""I think the Sir thing slightly perpetuates one of our diseases in England, which is snobbery,"" he said at the time. ""And it also helps keep us 'quaint', which I'm not a great fan of.""","Albert Finney, who has died at the age of 82 , came to prominence in the era of the ""Angry Young Men""."
"By Mark SavageBBC music reporter The service, which costs £5 more than a standard Amazon subscription, will also offer some albums in ""Ultra HD"", which promises to be better-than-CD quality. Until now, Amazon, like its main rivals Apple and Spotify, only streamed music in compressed formats like MP3 and AAC. Some smaller services like Tidal, Deezer and Qobuz already offer lossless, high-fidelity streaming. Amazon is calling its service ""HD"" because customers are familiar with the term from television, but it will actually use the same file format - FLAC - as its competitors. All three of the major record labels have signed up, with music by Fleetwood Mac, Kendrick Lamar, Taylor Swift, Stormzy and Ed Sheeran now available in Ultra HD. The big question, according to Chris Cooke of Complete Music Update, is whether ""Amazon can take what has traditionally been a niche product and make it more mainstream"". There have been several attempts to market HD audio in the past, from DVD-Audio and Super Audio CDs to high-quality download stores like Neil Young's ill-fated Pono service. But their audiences have been ""generally quite small"", said Cooke. ""Anecdotal research suggests that the younger demographic don't really care; and sometimes, even on a decent sound system, it's hard to tell the difference,"" he added. Indeed in 2015, US radio network NPR ran an online test to see whether its audience could distinguish between three forms of audio compression. On average, it discovered, people only did slightly better than guessing randomly. Amazon's advantage could be its dominance of the smart speaker market, with people listening at home more likely to appreciate a sonic upgrade than commuters streaming music over wireless earbuds. Notably, the launch of Amazon Music's HD service comes a week before the company unveils its latest range of hardware, which is expected to include a new model of its Echo speaker. The service is priced more competitively than its rivals, with a monthly subscription costing £14.99, or £12.99 for Amazon Prime customers. Tidal and Deezer, by comparison, charge £19.99 per month for their lossless tiers. ""It's interesting they've been able to negotiate that, because I presume Tidal and Deezer will go back to the labels and say, 'We want to bring down the costs of our high-quality audio too,'"" said Cooke. ""But it may well be that there are such a small number of users on [those services] that the labels are hoping Amazon, being a more mainstream company, will make up for the loss."" The technical bit In addition, Amazon Music HD subscribers can stream ""millions more"" songs in Ultra HD, with a bit depth of 24 bits and a sample rate up to 192 kHz. One notable enthusiast is Neil Young, who said in a (somewhat hyperbolic) press release that: ""Earth will be changed forever when Amazon introduces high quality streaming to the masses. ""This will be the biggest thing to happen in music since the introduction of digital audio 40 years ago,"" he added. Some of the additional money generated by the new service will go to artists and rights-holders, but Amazon could not discuss the terms of its new licensing deals. It confirmed, however, that there were no current plans to offer lossless music for sale on its download store. Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

"Miro's Peinture had been valued between £7m and £10m but went unsold at the Sotheby's event. By contrast another Miro work, Painting-Poem from 1925, set a new record for the artist after selling for £16.8m at Christie's on Tuesday. The same sale saw a Henry Moore figure go under the hammer for £19.1m. The amount fetched by his Reclining Figure: Festival - a bronze piece commissioned for the Festival of Britain in 1951 - was the most paid for a British sculpture at auction since Damien Hirst's The Golden Calf went for £10.3m in 2008. Another high-profile casualty on Wednesday was a 1901 landscape by the Austrian artist Gustav Klimt that failed to find a buyer willing to meet its £6m-£8m valuation. After the Sotheby's auction, however, the painting - called Seeufer mit Birken, or Lakeshore with Birches - changed hands in a private transaction for £5.6m. The highest price of the evening was set by L'Entree de Giverny en Hiver, a snowscape by Claude Monet that went for a cool £8.2m. Overall the sale of impressionist and modern art raised £78.9m - a disappointing amount for an event expected to fetch as much as £113.3m. Elsewhere in London this week, works by Pablo Picasso, Amedeo Modigliani, Pierre-Auguste Renoir and Marc Chagall went up for grabs at Bonhams auction house. Picasso took top honours at the auction on Tuesday, where his 1954 painting Notre Dame de Paris sold for £864,450.",A 1933 work by the Spanish artist Joan Miro failed to sell on Wednesday in a week that has seen other pieces sold for record prices at London auctions.
"The 71-year-old said he was ""moved, delighted and surprised"" to be awarded the Academy's highest honour. The director was previously presented a special Bafta in 1996 for outstanding British contribution to cinema. His latest film, Mr Turner, is up for four awards at this year's ceremony but was shut out of the main categories. Amanda Berry, Bafta's chief executive, called Leigh ""a true innovator, an artist and an exceptional film-maker"" who had made an ""outstanding and exceptional contribution to film"". The five-time Oscar nominee will receive his honour at Sunday's Baftas, which are being hosted by Stephen Fry at the Royal Opera House in London. Eyebrows were raised when Mr Turner, Leigh's portrait of the English artist JMW Turner, was left out of this year's best film and Best British film shortlists. Timothy Spall also missed out on a best actor nomination, despite being named best actor at last year's Cannes Film Festival. However, the film did receive recognition for its cinematography, costume design, production design and for its make-up and hair. The biopic is also up for four Oscars, one for its score and three more for its cinematography, production design and costumes. Leigh, whose other films include Secrets and Lies, Naked and Topsy-Turvy, will be honoured with a special luncheon at London's Savoy Hotel on the day before the Baftas. Previous recipients of the fellowship include Alfred Hitchcock, Steven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese and Dame Helen Mirren.","Veteran British film-maker Mike Leigh is to receive a Bafta Fellowship at this year's British Academy Film Awards, organisers have announced."
"By Genevieve HassanEntertainment reporter Director David Cronenberg attempted to revive the franchise in 2011, but 20th Century Fox passed on the project. An earlier sequel starring Eric Stoltz was critically panned in 1989, but Goldblum said he would like to see a new version created by Cronenberg. He told the BBC ""new technology"" would allow the director to ""do whatever he wants to with some other Fly story"". ""It was kind of primitive back in '86/'87 - I'd be interested in seeing it."" Goldblum starred as scientist Seth Brundle in The Fly, who turns into a giant insect after one of his experiments goes terribly wrong. The 1989 sequel saw Stoltz as Brundle's son searching for a cure to his mutated genes. 'Budget problem' Cronenberg, who was not part of the second film, first talked about writing a new version of the film back in 2009 and confirmed in 2011 he had written a script. Shortly after, he revealed 20th Century Fox was not interested and later explained it was ""a budget problem"". Goldblum said he was keen to team up with Cronenberg again, as he ""was satisfied with the very nourishing collaboration we had, but it would be dreamy to work with him"". ""I'd like to see anything he did really,"" he said. The actor is currently starring in another sequel, Independence Day: Resurgence, which picks up 20 years after the blockbuster hit. It sees Goldblum reprise his role as David Levinson, who is now in charge of Earth's space defences following the alien invasion of the first film. Liam Hemsworth also stars in the movie, with many of the original's cast returning including Bill Pullman, Vivica Fox and Brent Spiner. Independence Day took more than $800m (£545.6m) globally when it was released in 1996, but Goldblum said the new film was not an attempt to cash in on that success. ""All the creators were highly respectful of the audience that enjoyed the first one so much and shelled out their hard-earned money,"" he said. ""I don't think they wanted to do something just to exploit that interest and make them buy another ticket - I think they really wanted to satisfy them and felt a responsibility. ""I know [director] Roland [Emmerich] was not particularly excited about sequels in general. ""The first one was meant to be a stand-alone movie and he brought himself around to be passionate about it for its own reason - but not because it's a sequel. ""He tried to be as creative and original as he could."" Independence Day: Resurgence is released in UK cinemas on 23 June.",Film star Jeff Goldblum has said he would be interested in another sequel to his hit 1986 horror movie The Fly.
"By Mark SavageBBC music reporter The star gave fans in Lisbon just 45 minutes' notice that her show on Sunday night was being called off. ""We regret to inform you that Madonna is unable to perform this evening,"" an email informed ticketholders at 19:45. She had been due on stage at 20:30. ""Sorry I had to cancel tonight,"" the star wrote on Instagram, ""but I must listen to my body and rest!"" It is the eighth time Madonna has had to cancel a show on her current world tour, which sees her playing smaller, intimate theatre venues. She has not revealed the nature her injury, but told one audience in San Francisco she was suffering from a ""torn ligament"" and ""a bad knee"" in November. In a video posted to social media last week, she was shown wearing knee supports while rehearsing for an earlier show in Lisbon. ""How an injured Madame X warms up for a show,"" she wrote in the caption. ""Very carefully."" The star has also shared videos of her taking post-show ice baths to help her cope with ""multiple injuries"" that are causing ""overwhelming pain"". Madonna began the current stage of her Madame X tour in Portugal's Coliseu Dis Recreios theatre on 12 January, and had seemed to be in good spirits, interacting with the crowd and drinking port on stage. The star said it was her first drink ""in a month"" and that it had ""got her through"" the strenuous show. She also joked about her ""25 injuries"" and told the audience ""don't pay attention to what goes on from the waist down"", reported Lisbon-based music magazine Blitz. The star also traded high heels for flat shoes during last Thursday's concert. ""They are very ugly but it was either wear these boots or cancel the show,"" the star was quoted as saying by the Portuguese website Sapo. Madonna said she hoped the tour would resume this week, writing on Instagram: ""See you on Tuesday, fingers crossed."" The show is due to come to the UK on 27 January, with 15 dates planned at the London Palladium. At the scene - John Hand, BBC News Anger and recrimination might well have been expected among the Madonna fans who crowded outside the historic Coliseu Dos Recreios in the heart of Lisbon to hear the news they dreaded. Many had flown in from around the world to see their ""queen"" grace the intimate venue, just a few miles from her new Portuguese home. But as they took photos of the cancellation notices posted on the door, less than an hour before the official start time, there was plenty of understanding and concern for the injured star. After all, fans are fully aware that this is an all-out performer, battling against injury, who offers no compromise on stage. Madonna started out as a dancer and, even at 61, this is a show where her on-stage movement is as much a part of the act as her singing. One fan who summed up his own frustration by posting a single-finger message to Madonna was quickly joined online by others speculating that she may need to postpone the rest of her tour, including 15 dates at the London Palladium next month. But as a Coliseu staff member, standing at the door that remained resolutely shut, told me: ""She did a great show here last night so you and the other fans here tonight are really unlucky.""

Coming of age drama Boyhood walked away with the coveted best picture award. The Lego Movie - snubbed by Oscar voters earlier in the day - picked up the best animated feature award. Speaking at the Critics' Choice Awards about the omission, co-director Phil Lord said: ""We made it in order to inspire families and kids and people and we've been really justly rewarded, I think, for that. ""We feel really lucky and the awards stuff is its own thing, and of course we're disappointed, but it's not the reason we made the movie. There's no way to not be pleased with the outcome of this film."" Keaton, who was fine after his fall from the stage, won best actor and best actor in a comedy, while Birdman also collected best acting ensemble and original screenplay among its seven-trophy haul.

Oscar nominee Bradley Cooper won the award for best actor in an action movie, while British star Emily Blunt took the actress title, for Edge of Tomorrow. There was also recognition for space saga Interstellar in the sci-fi/horror category. Richard Linklater won best director for Boyhood, while Patricia Arquette won best supporting actress. Both are Oscar nominees. Ellar Coltrane won the best young actor for his role in the film, which started its 13-year long shoot when he was just five and continued over the course of 12 years.

"The Regent Street Cinema, within the University of Westminster's flagship building, first screened the Lumiere brothers' moving picture show in 1896. Considered the birthplace of British cinema, it is currently used as a lecture theatre. Following the restoration it will open to the public, filmmakers and students. The University of Westminster announced plans to return the historic 19th Century cinema to a state-of-the-art auditorium earlier this year. The project is backed by some of the biggest names in the British film industry and has now secured two-thirds of the £6.1 million necessary funding. Housed within the University's Grade II listed building, it is hoped the Regent Street Cinema will reopen in 2014. The Lumiere brothers chose the Regent Street Polytechnic, as it was then called, for the screening because of the institution's reputation as a leader in scientific experimentation and entertainment. It was the UK's first public cinema performance to a paying audience. Sue Bowers, Head of the Heritage Lottery Fund for London, said the cinema was a ""fascinating part of our heritage"" and has ""an important place in the world history of film"". Professor Geoffrey Petts, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Westminster said the University was ""delighted"" to be awarded the lottery grant. The cinema will give film students an unrivalled opportunity to premiere their work in London's West End. Graduates include filmmakers Michael Winterbottom, cinematographer Seamus McGarvey, who has worked on Atonement, We Need To Talk About Kevin and Avengers Assemble plus Senna director Asif Kapadia. This summer, 2011 Westminster graduate David Winstone won the top prize at the Student Academy Awards in Los Angeles for his short graduation film For Elsie.

They appeared on 39 radio shows in 1963 and, on one single day, recorded 18 songs for three editions of their Pop Go The Beatles series in a session lasting less than seven hours. In total they played 88 different songs, most done in one take with little time to correct mistakes. George Harrison recalled: ""Everything was done instantly. ""We used to drive 200 miles in an old van down the M1, come into London, try and find the BBC and then set up and do the programme. Then we'd probably drive back to Newcastle for a gig in the evening."" The new release will include different versions of some of the songs from the first Live at the BBC album and also features interviews recorded in November 1965 and May 1966 for the BBC Pop Profile series. The original Live At The BBC compilation album topped the charts when it was released in 1994, selling more than five million copies around the world in six weeks. A remastered version will also come out on 11 November to coincide with the release of volume 2.",Previously unreleased recordings and studio chatter by The Beatles are to be made available for the first time.
"Hip-hop duo Macklemore and Ryan Lewis took four awards - best new artist plus best rap album, song and performance. Justin Timberlake won three, while New Zealand teenager Lorde picked up two including song of the year for Royals. Sir Paul McCartney was among the other double winners and also reunited with his Beatles bandmate Ringo Starr. The pair teamed up for Sir Paul's song Queenie Eye during the ceremony, which is known for its heavyweight on-stage collaborations. The show was opened by Jay-Z and his wife Beyonce, while Madonna joined Macklemore and Lewis during their anti-homophobia anthem Same Love, as 33 same-sex and heterosexual couples got married on stage. Other collaborations included Metallica performing with pianist Lang Lang and Daft Punk, Nile Rodgers and Pharrell Williams being joined by Stevie Wonder to perform Get Lucky. The dance pioneers, real names Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo, never appear in public without their trademark robot helmets. Get Lucky, which featured producer and singer Pharrell and disco guitarist and producer Rodgers, was one of the biggest hits of 2013. As well as scooping album and record of the year, Daft Punk won best pop duo/group performance for Get Lucky and best dance/electronica album for Random Access Memories. The album was also named best engineered album, non-classical, which was credited to its engineers. So they left the acceptance speeches to their collaborators. ""Well, I suppose the robots would like to thank..."" joked Pharrell, who also won non-classical producer of the year. ""You know honestly, I bet France is really proud of these guys right now."" As well as performing, Sir Paul McCartney picked up the trophies for best music film and best rock song for Cut Me Some Slack, a collaboration with the surviving members of Nirvana. It beat The Rolling Stones' Doom And Gloom, from their 50th anniversary album GRRR!, as well as tracks by veteran metal band Black Sabbath, stadium rockers Muse and US singer-guitarist Gary Clark Jr. Black Sabbath did scoop best metal performance, while Led Zeppelin won best rock album for their live recording Celebration Day. Other British nominees included Ed Sheeran and James Blake, who were both up for best new artist, but lost out to Macklemore and Lewis. Rapper Macklemore and producer Ryan Lewis, who found fame after self-releasing their album The Heist, won four awards from seven nominations. ""We made this album without a record label, we made it independently and we appreciate all the support,"" Macklemore told the audience. Seventeen-year-old Lorde's debut single Royals earned song of the year and best pop solo performance after catapulting her to the top of the charts around the world last year. Jay-Z started the night with the most nominations, up for nine awards. He won best rap/sung collaboration for Holy Grail, featuring Justin Timberlake. Timberlake, Pharrell and rapper Kendrick Lamar were among the acts who went into the ceremony with seven nominations. Other winners included Adele for her James Bond theme Skyfall, which won the prize for best song written for visual media, and Scottish percussionist Dame Evelyn Glennie, who won best classical instrumental solo. British hitmaker Calvin Harris was up for best dance/electronica album for 18 Months and best dance recording for Sweet Nothing with Florence and the Machine's Florence Welch, but lost out on both. UK acts Duke Dumont and Disclosure were also unsuccessful nominees in the dance categories. David Bowie had been nominated for best rock album and best rock performance for his 2013 comeback, but missed out in both categories. The awards can be seen on Monday 27 January at 9pm on 4Music.","French dance duo Daft Punk have taken top honours at the Grammy Awards, winning five prizes including album and record of the year."
"By Steven McIntoshEntertainment reporter But surely only the bravest among you would've gone to the ""immersive"" screenings of the movie. Such fans would've had the pleasure of a real-life Pennywise the Clown creeping round the auditorium during the film, jumping out at them from behind and basically scaring the living daylights out of everyone there. While many of us may think this sounds like the most utterly hideous experience in the world, not everyone feels that way - immersive horror is becoming quite a thing. ""There's huge growth in this area,"" says Simon Oakes, CEO of British horror brand Hammer, who have just premiered their first immersive show, The Soulless Ones. ""It's a generational thing, newer audiences want something that's more tangible, emotional, more physical an experience, which is different from the promenade shows that you would've seen before, or even traditional theatre."" As anybody who has been to the cinema in the last decade knows, many people struggle to go for more than about four-and-a-half minutes without checking their WhatsApp, so the appeal of immersive theatre may be down to being totally engrossed in something and disconnected from the outside world. Of course, we've seen hugely popular immersive shows before with the likes of Punchdrunk and You Me Bum Bum Train. ""There's a whole generation of younger audiences who are excited about the idea of being involved in a story rather than told it,"" says Oscar Blustin, the co-writer and co-director of The Soulless Ones. ""I think gaming has a lot to do with it, and how young audiences expect things to be interactive. ""When you watch TV, we've all shouted at the screen, 'Don't go in there!' or 'Don't go upstairs', I think artists are recognising that this can engage audiences more with the narrative."" In the case of The Soulless Ones, Simon says: ""We wanted to come up with something completely original."" ""With something like The Great Gatsby or Alice in Wonderland, the audience knows what they're going to get. If you know the show, you've already bought into what the creative expectation might be. ""So we chose to start with a completely new show, this isn't a Frankenstein or Dracula, so as a story it's original."" Horror is arguably the genre which provides the most potential to create an immersive experience for theatregoers. ""I think that's because it's able to shed a light on your deepest fears,"" says Simon. ""We don't want to frighten people and scare people as much as unsettle them. But it's not a jump-scare performance, which a lot of the modern horror films are. ""The general philosophy behind horror is that if you don't care about the people, you don't care about what happens to them, and with the great genre directors like Kubrick and Hitchcock, you were invested in the characters."" While the immersive screenings of Stephen King's It were just a few special ones organised to promote the film, The Soulless Ones has a residency at Hoxton Hall in London from this week until 31 October. Oscar explains the show is about ""a hive of vampires who are trying to perform a ritual which will let them walk in the daylight - it's our take on the vampire legend"". ""That is the over-arching story, but there are 14 characters, and 18-20 different rooms around the building, they all interweave and interlink, it's a patchwork of narrative threads."" That may sound a little overwhelming, but Simon argues one key aspect of the show's appeal is the potential for repeat visits. ""Because of the number of rooms, we've got 14 hours in total of prepared material,"" he says. ""And I hope that's one of the reasons people might want to see it again. You'd comfortably be able to see the show four times, and never see the same show twice, if you were clever about the route you take. ""Whichever room you walk into, you'll get a different side of the same story."" Oscar points out that audiences would struggle to play with their phones during performances even if they wanted to, ""mostly because the Victorian music hall we're performing in has absolutely no signal"". And if fans enjoy the experience, it could well lead to other similar projects. ""We're not like Marvel or DC comics,"" says Simon, ""at Hammer we feel immersive theatre is an intriguing part of what we do in terms of creating intellectual property. ""But what we do have is a place in this area, if it's successful, to be a building block to others."" Oscar adds: ""People are so on the hunt for unique and one-off experiences in particular. ""There's so much to talk about with immersive theatre, audiences who can compare notes on what they've seen and the different experience they've had at the same show. ""In the bar afterwards I'm anticipating a lot of 'What did you see?' conversations."" Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

"Titled Yves Saint Laurent: Style is Eternal, the museum will show key items which revolutionised womenswear during the French designer's 50-year career. The garments will include his female tuxedo, trouser suit and works inspired by artists like Picasso and Mondrian. The exhibition will run from 11 July to 25 October. Saint Laurent's former partner Pierre Berge said the Bowes Museum, a French-style chateau in Barnard Castle, was ""the perfect setting"". ""It is extremely exciting to work on this first exhibition in the UK,"" he said. ""The Bowes Museum is a natural destination given its exceptional work with fashion and textiles; the museum and its location also clearly reflects Yves Saint Laurent's and my own passion for inspiring, timeless places."" Saint Laurent made his name when Christian Dior picked him to become his assistant at the age of 17. When Dior died three years later, Saint Laurent took over the Dior house. With Berge, he founded what was to become the multi-million-pound Saint Laurent fashion and perfume empire in 1962. He died in 2008. The Bowes Museum's fashion curator Joanna Hashagen said the exhibition would create ""a dialogue between the designer's body of work and The Bowes Museum's collection"".",The first major UK exhibition of the fashion of Yves Saint Laurent is to be staged at the Bowes Museum in County Durham later this year.
"Tree, which will premiere at the Manchester International Festival, is credited to Elba and Kwame Kwei-Armah. Tori Allen-Martin and Sarah Henley said they worked on it for four years but were ""pushed off"" and got no credit. In response, the producers said Tree ""needed to go in a very different direction with a new writer attached"". Manchester International Festival and London's Young Vic theatre, along with Elba's production company Green Door Pictures, acknowledged that Allen-Martin and Henley were ""involved in exploring ideas"" for the show. They said they were ""grateful"" to the pair, but that their proposed direction was not ""artistically viable"". Kwei-Armah, the Young Vic's artistic director, wrote the script instead, they said. ""Tree is a new work, based on a concept by Idris Elba with an original script by Kwame Kwei-Armah."" However, in a lengthy and impassioned blog published on Tuesday, the two women documented how Allen-Martin had been asked by Elba to come up with an idea for a show before they researched it, wrote a script and came up with the name. But they said Kwei-Armah then took over the project, and they were later dismissed and ""threatened... with legal action if we spoke up"". ""There is no way it's a 'different project', no matter how much it's changed,"" they wrote. ""And the reluctance to take any accountability for the fact that until we fought it, the majority of the revised synopsis was our work, just without our names on it, is at best sad and at worst, disgusting."" Kwei-Armah ""refused to engage"" with them, and the episode was ""devastating proof of the way doors are shut on women, and on the underdogs"", they said. ""We became completely disposable because we're not famous or important enough. We were expected to shut up, lie down, and take it."" In his response on Twitter, Kwei-Armah said he understood ""the pain of being 'released' from a project"". 'I am sorry for your pain' He also said that Elba had requested that Allen-Martin and Henley remain involved, but that they ""refused to meet me"" after he wrote a ""very, very rough outline"" for a new direction for the show. ""I never refused to communicate with you,"" he said. He eventually wrote a new script that he said was ""very different"" from their original. ""I am sorry for your pain. But to almost single me out as the reason your script was not produced is neither fair nor correct."" Elba is not in Tree, which stars Sinead Cusack and Alfred Enoch, known as Dean Thomas in the Harry Potter films and Wes Gibbins in How To Get Away With Murder?. The show is billed as a mixture of drama, music and dance, and was inspired by Elba's 2014 album Mi Mandela. It will have its premiere at MIF on Thursday before a run at the Young Vic. In their statement, MIF, the Young Vic and Green Door said: ""Tree is a new work, based on a concept by Idris Elba with an original script by Kwame Kwei-Armah."" MIF artistic director John McGrath said: ""His script for Tree is entirely his creation and is, in my opinion, a resonant and exciting response to the themes of Idris's Mi Mandela album.""

"By Mark SavageMusic reporter The company hopes to attract users with a mixture of officially licensed tracks and its catalogue of 125 million covers, remixes, DJ sets and podcasts. Called Soundcloud Go, it costs £9.99 per month in line with its rivals. Soundcloud itself will remain free to use, although listeners in the UK and Ireland will hear advertisements between songs from Tuesday morning. The launch is a big move for the company, which built its business by allowing artists to upload their music and share it with fans on social media and blogs. Acts like Drake, Lily Allen, Kanye West and Miley Cyrus have used it to premiere songs, or share works in progress - even when they have a stake in rival streaming services, as West does with Tidal. It has established the Berlin-based company as an influential player in the music industry, especially in the dance music genre. Crowded market The company was valued at $700m (£478m) in a funding round in 2014, but it has only recently started trying to make money from its 175 million users. The subscription service launches with a free 30-day trial, and allows users to store tracks on their phone for offline use - ""the number one requested feature"", the company says. But it is launching into an increasingly crowded market. Apple has attracted 11 million people to its music streaming service since it arrived last summer. Market leader Spotify is approaching 30 million subscribers while Tidal, which recently boasted exclusives from Rihanna and Beyonce, has about three million paying customers. Soundcloud Go launched in the US in March to mixed reviews, with tech website Engadget calling it ""a mess"" and ""a chore to use"". The Verge noted it offered ""far fewer"" official tracks than its rivals, with artists like Katy Perry, One Direction, The Beatles and Radiohead missing from its line-up. CEO Alexander Ljung and senior vice president Sylvain Grande told BBC News those gaps were being plugged, and discussed their plans for the service. Tell us a bit about Soundcloud Go Alexander: The cool part about that is you have everything from the biggest hits to all the emerging stuff - new artists and remixes and so on. It's the first time that's ever existed. And you combine that with actually having this presence from the artists themselves. So you get these authentic moments and tracks you wouldn't have expected - like when Miley Cyrus came out of the studio once and uploaded 100 tracks. There were a lot songs missing when you launched in the US. Is that going to be the case for the UK launch, too? Alexander: Not everything was there on day one, but a lot of it has been added since. We're still ingesting huge amount of content every day. Why launch the product before that work was complete? Sylvain: We wanted to avoid leaks. 99% of the content is there now. Will people like Kanye West still put exclusive tracks on Soundcloud now it's become more commercial? Alexander: For artists generally, one of the things that's special about SoundCloud is they have their own account, which they control. So that's led to a different degree of authenticity. If they have an idea they went to get out to the world, a bit like Twitter, they can publish it instantly. That's become a really powerful way for artists to connect to fans. They can't really do that anywhere else. Right now, you can find individual tracks from Adele or Coldplay, but there's no way to listen to a complete album. Why not? Sylvain: We've ingested all the tracks and we're working on it. We never had albums functionality per se on SoundCloud - people might create playlists and so on - but in the coming months we're going to have the album visualisation in the service as well. It's been reported that Sony and Universal took a stake in the company when you signed a licensing deal with them... Alexander: We don't comment on any deal terms. There hasn't been any official word on how the deals work. Does having closer ties with the major labels mean we'll see unofficial remixes and cover versions taken down from Soundcloud? Alexander: A lot of people believe that doing deals with the majors leads to more takedowns, when it's exactly the opposite. Part of the deal is that it creates a framework for being able to create a revenue stream for all this derivative content - remixes and cover versions. That type of content has never really existed in the music industry before, and now we can start to generate revenue from that and pay it back to the industry. So the incentive is to keep it up and earn money, rather than take it down. It was widely reported that Soundcloud made a loss of $44m in 2014. Can the subscription service turn that around? Alexander: We don't really comment on the financial results but the truth is that we're a high-growth start-up. It's a very common path. The reason you raise money is to invest it into growth before you focus on profitability. Do you have a goal for profitability? Alexander: I have a point in mind. But we might change it along the way, depending on what we want to prioritise. Soundcloud Go is launching today in the UK and Ireland. Will it be coming to the rest of Europe? Alexander: Yes, there will be more territories coming soon.",Music streaming service Soundcloud has launched a UK paid-for service to rival the likes of Spotify and Apple Music.
"The Crown, writes Daniel Fienberg in The Hollywood Reporter, ""should be a real awards player for performances and also in myriad technical categories"". Vanity Fair's critic dubs it ""a stately success, alluring and easily digested."" Claire Foy plays the young Elizabeth in the 10-part series, while Doctor Who's Matt Smith portrays Prince Philip. Other cast members include John Lithgow, whose performance as Winston Churchill is described as ""towering"" and ""great throughout"" by Fienberg. Peter Morgan's drama - available on Netflix from Friday - follows 2006 film The Queen, which he wrote, and his 2013 stage play The Audience. Both pieces explored the monarch's relationships with the various prime ministers she has dealt with over the course of her 64-year reign. The first series of The Crown begins before Elizabeth's ascension to the throne in 1952 and runs until 1955. The result, writes Vanity Fair's Richard Lawson, is a ""dynastic family drama, told on an extravagant scale"". According to The List's Henry Northmore, the show's ""extensive"" budget ensures it is ""beautifully made"" and boasts ""lavish"" sets and costumes. The show, he suggests, ""can be a bit stuffy"" but remains ""a fascinating portrayal of post-war Britain and the birth of the modern monarchy"". Foy and Smith were in attendance on Tuesday at a red carpet launch for the drama, held in London's Leicester Square. At the event, director Stephen Daldry said the show had been made for the Netflix subscription service because it offered the ""freedom to tell the story we wanted to tell"".

Disney's current release Big Hero 6 and The Lego Movie also compete for the event's top prize, as does sequel How To Train Your Dragon 2. The awards will be handed out at a Los Angeles ceremony on 31 January. They cover 36 separate categories including feature film, short-form and television work, as well as individual achievements in character animation, design, effects, music, storyboarding, writing and voice acting. Disney picked up 30 nominations in total, followed by Dreamworks with 15. Actor Sir Ben Kingsley received a nod for the voice of Archibald Snatcher in The Boxtrolls. The film's other nominations included best character animation and design, writing and directing in an animated feature. How To Train Your Dragon 2 scored 10 nominations, joining The Boxtrolls in the character animation, animation effects and best feature categories.

"By Torin DouglasMedia correspondent, BBC News These are highly significant changes for the BBC, finalised in a hectic few hours before publication of the government's Spending Review. They will be formally announced on Wednesday. Only a few weeks ago, Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt said he would not start discussions over the next licence fee until next summer. Suddenly, they are all over. The BBC now knows its income for the next six years, which gives it some security and stability. But that income will be frozen while inflation almost certainly rises, and its costs will be around £340m a year higher. Greater independence The World Service currently costs £272m a year, paid for by the Foreign Office. The new arrangement will give it clearer editorial and operational independence from the government, and that has been welcomed by a former head of the World Service, Sir John Tusa. But funded by the licence fee, the World Service will now find itself part of a wider BBC that is required to find ever greater cuts. Some fear that it may lose some of its distinctiveness, or be first in line for those cuts. And some will criticise the way the far-reaching decision was made, with apparently little consultation. The BBC is refusing to comment, but those close to the negotiations say these new obligations for the BBC will mean a 16% cut in real terms over the next six years. They believe the settlement is tough, but realistic at a time of public spending cuts - and a better option than the proposal to make the BBC pay the cost of free TV licences for the over-75s. That currently costs £556m a year - paid for by the Department of Work and Pensions - roughly the cost of running BBC Two or the whole of BBC Radio. The BBC Trust said it would oppose such a plan, arguing that ""it would be unacceptable for licence fee payers to pick up the bill for what is a DWP universal benefit."" Independence By contrast, the BBC's new obligations are clearly rooted in broadcasting. The BBC will also fund - though not control - the Welsh language channel S4C, which has been facing upheavals of its own, including budget cuts that threatened its future. BBC Wales has been told there is no question of the BBC ""taking over"" S4C, which will retain its operational independence. If that is the case, some will say this looks suspiciously like the ""top-slicing"" that was vehemently opposed by the BBC Trust last year, when the Labour government proposed handing some of the licence fee to ITV to preserve its regional news bulletins. It was also opposed by Jeremy Hunt.","The BBC licence fee is to be held at its current level for six years as the corporation agrees to fund the World Service, the Welsh language channel, S4C, and the roll-out of broadband to rural areas."
"The currently unnamed contestant answered all 15 questions correctly to become the show's sixth champion. Host Jeremy Clarkson said he was ""in awe"" and believed them to be the best entrant in the programme's history. This series was filmed without a studio audience, meaning the Ask The Audience lifeline has disappeared. Instead, contestants have been able to use the Phone A Friend option twice. The new series of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire will begin on ITV next month. 'The best ever' Clarkson said: ""Well, I'm absolutely thrilled and delighted that we've found someone who seems to know just about everything. ""I can't wait for the viewers to see it and I want to watch it back too."" He continued: ""I was just in awe of this contestant and think they are probably the best the show has ever had in its 22-year history. ""It was a joy to sit and watch it unfold."" Clarkson, who also hosts The Grand Tour, said the contestant ""whizzed through the 15 questions and all of a sudden confetti was falling from the ceiling and I was saying, 'You've just won £1m'. ""I wasn't sure I'd ever get to utter those immortal six words and I'm not embarrassed to say, it was a little emotional but boy did it feel good."" But some were puzzled by the decision to announce the winner before the episode's broadcast, suggesting knowing in advance was a spoiler. ""I don't understand why ITV have told everyone that this has happened?"" said TV critic Scott Bryan. One fan replied: ""Speaking as a regular viewer, this kind of ruins it for me. Part of the fun is the anticipation, and when you know it's going to happen, it's ruined."" But the Daily Mirror's showbiz editor Mark Jeffries tweeted: ""My guess is 1) I think they thought it might leak 2) They are hoping it boosts ratings and people tune in every night for the whole run to make sure they see the winner."" Previous winners In May, retired doctor Andrew Townsley, from Glasgow, came close to the jackpot but walked away with £500,000.

"By Mark SavageBBC music reporter The musician's scratchy, staccato riffs provided the band with their signature sound, and influenced the likes of Nirvana, Fugazi and Franz Ferdinand. His bandmates announced his death in a statement, saying: ""Our great friend and supreme leader has died today"".

""One of the best to ever do it, his influence on guitar music and the creative process was inspiring for us, as well as everyone who worked alongside him and listened to his music. ""His albums and production work speak for themselves. Go give 'em a spin for him."" Formed in Leeds in 1976, Gang Of Four's career spanned five decades, from their first single Damaged Goods to last year's studio album Happy Now. In 1979, they made their Top 60 chart debut with At Home He's A Tourist - despite the song being banned by the BBC for a lyrical reference to condoms. Their debut album Entertainment!, released in September of the same year, has frequently been cited as an influence or inspiration by aspiring musicians, and was named one of Rolling Stone magazine's 500 greatest albums of all time. Combining Marxist politics with punk, dub, funk and disco, the ""stiff, jerky aggression of songs such as Damaged Goods and I Found That Essence Rare invented a new style,"" the magazine wrote. 'Lightbulb moment' Gill's unique guitar riffs were choppy and funky with bursts of freeform noise, taking inspiration from a range of players, including Jimi Hendrix, Wilko Johnson and Parliament-Funkadelic's Eddie Hazel. ""Seeing Wilko and Dr Feelgood was a real lightbulb moment,"" he told The Skinny in 2015. ""He never stopped looking at the audience and didn't spend much time looking at his guitar - I duly noted that. ""I always think of the guitar as being part of a larger instrument, which is the band,"" Gill added. ""What I always find uninspiring is when guitarists treat the rest of the band as a background over which they show off."" Gang Of Four never had a hit single (1982's I Love A Man In Uniform came close, before it was banned from the airwaves during the Falklands War) but their first three albums are considered indispensable. They split in 1984, but reformed several times over the years, with a variety of line-ups. Gill was the only constant throughout their career. The Manchester-born musician was also a respected producer, working with bands including The Stranglers, Killing Joke, and Red Hot Chili Peppers. His influence on guitar bands stretched far and wide.

"By Ian YoungsEntertainment & arts reporter The way they tell their story, the fact their frontman is the son of one of the world's biggest rock stars is almost irrelevant. Yes, Elijah Hewson does have something of his dad's on-stage magnetism. Yes, he has a familiar yearning voice. Yes, there is a certain resemblance in the unkempt 80s mullet. Yes, his dad is U2 singer Bono. But the 20-year-old singer-guitarist-songwriter and his bandmates have spent 2019 showing signs - not least to the 170 music critics, DJs and musicians who have voted them to fifth place on the BBC Music Sound of 2020 list - that they have what it takes to be more than U2.0. Inhaler's sound combines a recognisable widescreen sweep with a baggy Madchester vibe and modern, synth-swathed indie melodies. The anthemic My Honest Face is their stand-out track so far. At the same time, they have been relentlessly gigging to build up a fanbase of their own. They supported Noel Gallagher at two big summer shows and recently finished their first US tour, supporting Blossoms. Their sound has more muscle than many of their indie contemporaries, and they say their forthcoming debut album will be about the effects of their generation's dependence on smartphones and social media. So if Inhaler can build on their 80s and 90s influences (both parental and otherwise) while feeding their own generation's tastes and concerns, they will excite a young audience for whom Bono's band are, yes, almost irrelevant. Hewson and his bandmates Robert Keating (bass), Josh Jenkinson (guitar) and Ryan McMahon (drums) sat down to talk about where Inhaler have come from and where they are going in 2020. Inhaler were chosen for the BBC Sound of 2020 list by a panel of 170 music critics, broadcasters, festival bookers and previous nominees - including Lewis Capaldi, Chvrches and Billie Eilish. The top five were: 1.Celeste 2.Easy Life 3.Yungblud 4.Joy Crookes 5.Inhaler How has 2019 treated you? Ryan: Better than any other year as a band. Eli: We started two or three years ago just as kids in a school band doing covers and that sort of thing. I don't think any of us knew what we wanted to do after school. The band was something we always enjoyed, so we decided to go for it this year and it's really worked out well. You bonded over your musical tastes at school, right? Robert: We were the only kids listening to a certain kind of music and that really brought us together in a special way. [It was] the love of rock music. Eli: It was really anything with guitars. We all wanted to play guitar in the band. Josh: I was in a different school but I met Eli at a party and he played me I Wanna Be Adored by The Stone Roses. What else did you bond over? Eli: There was a lot of music from Manchester in the 90s, and the whole Britpop and Oasis thing. Every kid who's 16 and sees that goes, 'I want to be in a band'. Tell me about the band name - are you all asthmatic? Eli: No, just me. We were struggling to find a band name that we could all agree on for a long time. I'm asthmatic so my sister as a joke used to call us The Inhalers and it kind of caught on. We liked it because it's something you have to rely on and it's a pick-me-up, and it relates to the stuff we're talking about on the new material on the album. What are you tackling in your lyrics? Eli: As teenagers growing up these days, it's interesting seeing how addictive things are, and that's down to people's phones and social media. I'm even noticing I just always want to be looking at my phone. I can't just walk outside and stand there and walk to a place without checking something. Inhaler is - you take it when you can't breathe and you've got a medical issue, but it relates to self-medication and it's a stimulus. There's a plethora of stimuli that we have today. I can see it in my friends. We'll be sitting there having dinner together and everyone will be zombied out on their phone. Or, 'Where are we going next?' Are you yearning for a simpler time? Eli: Kind of. We're not trying to slam it. I just think it's interesting to see the effect it has on people. Josh: It's more of an observation… Robert: …than saying it's a bad thing, because it could be a good thing, all this stuff that's going on. Ryan: It's more just us trying to understand how you go about dealing with something like this, through music as well, because everything we do is under the eye of everyone. You play a song at a gig and it could go horribly wrong, but it's there forever. Everything is so accessible. It's mad and it's never been like that before. When you're writing, where and when do you get in the zone? Eli: With lyrics I definitely have to be on my own. Usually in my room with an acoustic guitar late at night. Do you have your own place? Eli: No, I live at home with my parents, like all of us. Do they ever complain about the noise? Eli: Not as much as they should. Did you grow up around venues and get taken on tours? Eli: I did, but it's funny, I don't really have that much memory of it really. I was a lot younger and my parents wouldn't take me out of school or anything. Did that make you want to be in that world? Eli: It's funny, I really wasn't into music as a kid, and I only really started getting into music when I was 13 and I discovered it my own way rather than growing up in it. With anything, you have to have your own angle on it for you to be attached to it. I just wasn't that interested in it as a kid. At all. Do you think you've learned anything from your dad, consciously or subconsciously? Eli: Definitely subconsciously, yeah. Just from hearing him play a song in the house and listening to it and he critiques it, and that sort of stuff. But I'd never ask him for advice - only advice about where am I going to live next year and that sort of thing. I try not to ask him about music. Because you want to do it your way? Eli: Yeah, definitely. Do you think that family connection is a pro or a con? Robert: I don't really see it as anything. It doesn't really affect us, apart from having to talk about it in interviews, which is fine. It is what it is. We love our band, we meet young people all the time who like our music. Eli: A lot of U2 fans do come to our gigs, who are all really lovely. They've all been really supportive, so obviously that's a benefit. But I'd say it can also be an obstacle as well if you're trying to do stuff your own way. But we're not complaining at all. You've just been on tour of the States with Blossoms. Eli: Best two weeks of our lives. Josh: It was my and Ryan's first time in the States so we were just blown away by everything. Robert: We saw the White House, we saw the house from Home Alone in Chicago. That was pretty cool. Did you recreate any scenes? Josh: No, but Ryan looked like the sticky bandits for the whole trip because he had a hat on. Eli: When we started a band, when I pictured success it was us driving across America in the back of a van. We've done it. Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

"Guillermo del Toro's The Shape of Water leads this year with 12 nominations in total - including best film and best director. Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri and Darkest Hour are close behind, with nine nominations each. Joanna Lumley is hosting this year's ceremony - she takes over from Stephen Fry, who stepped down last year after presenting 12 times. Here are six things to expect from this year's awards. 1. The stars will be wearing black to support Time's Up The Time's Up movement's first initiative saw guests at the Golden Globe awards dress in black to bring attention to the fight against sexual harassment in Hollywood. Now Britain's biggest stars are expected to follow suit as indicated by a letter that has been circulated around the British film and TV industry. The request has gathered support from stars including Emma Thompson, Daisy Ridley, Emma Watson and Keira Knightley. 2. There will be a brand new host Joanna Lumley will be replacing Stephen Fry, who has presented the ceremony 12 times in total, as master of ceremonies. The Absolutely Fabulous actress will be the first female host since Mariella Frostrup co-presented with Fry in 2001. Lumley received the Bafta Fellowship at the Bafta TV Awards last May and was met with huge cheers from the crowd. 3. Equality and sexual harassment will be a big talking point One of the big talking points from January's Golden Globes came when Natalie Portman highlighted on stage that everyone up for best director was male. This is echoed at the Baftas, with nominations going to Denis Villeneuve, Luca Guadagnino, Christopher Nolan, Guillermo Del Toro and Martin McDonagh. This year's ceremony could see stars using their platform to discuss issues of sexual harassment and also vocalise the growing debate on equal pay in the industry. 4. Three films will be competing for the top spot The Shape of Water received 12 nominations including best leading actress, best film and best director. It is closely followed by Darkest Hour and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, which have received nine nominations each. The most notable omission is The Post, starring Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks, which didn't receive any nominations, unlike at the Golden Globes and Oscars. 5. Two actors could walk away with a double Bafta scoop Get Out's Daniel Kaluuya and Call Me By Your Name's Timothee Chalamet are nominated for both best leading actor and EE's Rising Star Award. One of them could walk away with two awards, which would be a very rare feat in film ceremony terms. The Rising Star Award is the only category voted for by the public and both Kaluuya and Chalamet are currently enjoying their time in the spotlight - Kaluuya is starring in Black Panther and Chalamet also has a supporting role in Lady Bird. 6. Globes and Oscar-snubbed films could get their time to shine Gary Oldman won best actor in a motion picture at the Golden Globes for his portrayal of Winston Churchill in the Darkest Hour. He is tipped to do the same at the Oscars next month, but other British films have been snubbed by the American ceremonies. Lady Macbeth has two nominations - for outstanding British film and outstanding debut by a British writer, director or producer. Film Stars Don't Die in Liverpool received three nominations, with Annette Bening and Jamie Bell nominated for best actor and actress, while it has also picked up a nomination for best adapted screenplay.

"By Steven McIntoshEntertainment reporter The photograph of Damilola, dressed in his school uniform, smiling at the camera, is difficult to forget. The picture was released after he bled to death in a Peckham housing estate in November 2000 and dominated the newspaper front pages. ""It really shook people,"" says Levi David Addai, who has written the screenplay for a new BBC One drama about Taylor's murder and how his family coped. ""How could this happen? A primary school boy coming home got killed. Even today, just saying it, sounds impossible."" Taylor had been walking home from Peckham Library when he was stabbed in the leg with a broken glass bottle. He tried to walk the rest of the way home but collapsed in a nearby stairwell. Recalling Taylor's death 16 years on, Addai says: ""It really shocked the nation, seeing this young boy full of life and potential, and that was robbed. You can't compute that."" Actor Babou Ceesay plays Richard Taylor, Damilola's father, in the drama. He remembers being at university when he heard the news. Innocent boy ""The thing that struck me most was the fact that he was 10,"" he says. ""I was a young man and I was really quite taken by that aspect of it. When I realised his age it hit me really badly. ""Damilola was also innocent, he wasn't someone who was involved in gangs. Not that a teenager dying from being within a gang is better or worse, but we kind of hope that someone who is outside can avoid that kind of experience."" Four youths, including two brothers, went on trial for murder in 2002, but none were convicted. Speaking outside the Old Bailey after the case, Richard and Gloria Taylor vowed to continue fighting for justice - a moment which inspired Addai when writing the drama. ""I always remember Richard and Gloria on the steps of the court and their pictures being taken and then them disappearing into a cab, and I was wondering, what happened next?"" he says. ""What was discussed in that cab? What happened when they got home? What I thought would be interesting would be to go behind the headlines of the family."" Damilola: Our Loved Boy attempts to tell that story. The drama opens with a look at the lives the Taylor family were living in Nigeria before they moved to the UK. ""People aren't aware that Richard Taylor and his family were actually living a very good middle-class life in Nigeria,"" Ceesay says. Gloria Taylor, Damilola's mother, travelled to London with her 10-year-old son and his two older siblings - brother Tunde and sister Gbemi. Richard Taylor was working for the Nigerian Ministry of Defence at the time but planned to join the rest of his family in London at a later date. Writer Addai says: ""I came up with a rough idea for the drama that was very family focused, and with Richard, Damilola's father, trying to do the best for his family."" Richard Taylor was still in Nigeria when his oldest son phoned him to tell him the devastating news that his youngest son had died. Damilola's father quickly flew to London. He visited the spot where his son bled to death and spoke movingly about his ""lovely boy"" at a press conference the day before what would have been Damilola's 11th birthday. Ceesay says: ""I hope people empathise with a family going through that. There were five of them and now there's four, and the way in which they've lost probably the most effervescent member of the family, that's so tragic."" After Damilola's death, it took six years and three trials to identify and convict his killers. Brothers Danny and Ricky Preddie, who were aged 12 and 13 at the time, were eventually convicted of manslaughter in 2006 after new DNA evidence came to light. The drama was made with the consent of Richard Taylor, whose wife Gloria died in 2008. ""All of the film was inspired the conversations that were had with Richard, Tunde, other family members and friends,"" Addai says. For his role, Ceesay says: ""I was interested in Richard Taylor as a man, this persona that he's got of being completely dignified, which he is, and after playing the character I feel it even more strongly. However, what did he have to go through?"" The actor conveys the rage and devastation Richard Taylor felt in the aftermath of his son's death, while maintaining a dignified front. ""It's not the most flattering portrayal of him, and he's such a brave, dignified and actually surprisingly playful person,"" says Ceesay. But the actor did not meet Taylor until after filming. ""Before we started shooting, my instinct immediately told me I wanted to meet him, watch his mannerisms and so forth. ""But the director said, 'Actually, I think I'd rather see you put yourself through what he went through rather than trying to be Richard Taylor.'"" When Ceesay finally met Taylor, he says he found him ""compelling"", adding: ""I think he was aware that if he was there during the performance it would put a lot of pressure on me."" Addai confirms: ""Richard has been so supportive and is really delighted with the finished product."" A year after his son's death, Richard Taylor launched the Damilola Taylor Trust, which Ceesay praises for ""doing incredible work trying to connect with young people"". The work Damilola's father now does is one of the reasons Ceesay says he hopes viewers take a ""positive message"" from the drama, ""one of hope, one of trying to engage with young people"". Addai agrees: ""The fact that this family stuck together and were so dignified and held on together, that's what I'd love for people to take away. It's a story of hope.""

'Enjoy every minute' ""From the beginning of September, I'm definitely going to be doing 12 hours a week training but everybody says I'll have to do quite a few more hours than that,"" he said.

"By Mark SavageBBC music reporter The pastel-coloured, dance-heavy video was watched 101.1 million times in 24 hours after its release last Friday. That surpasses the previous record, set by fellow K-Pop band Blackpink, whose song How You Like That racked up 86.3 million views in 24 hours in June. Dynamite is also the first video to achieve 100 million views in one day. More than three million fans also tuned in to watch the clip's live premiere - almost double the previous record, also held by Blackpink's How You Like That. Dynamite is the first single from BTS to be sung entirely in English, and the band said they wanted it to convey ""positive vibes, energy, hope, love, the purity, everything"". The septet first teased the video in July, explaining that they were currently preparing an album for the second half of the year. ""[We] decided to first release a single because we wanted to reach our fans as soon as possible. Due to Covid-19, people around the world have been going through tough times and we wanted to share some positive energy with our fans,"" they said. The shimmery, pop-disco track was written by David Stewart and Jessica Agombar, who most recently teamed up for the Jonas Brothers' hit, What a Man Gotta Do. It has already topped the iTunes download chart in 104 countries, and could give the band their first UK number one single this Friday. According to the Official Chart Company, Dynamite notched up 1.7 million UK streams in its first 48 hours, and is currently 1,700 chart sales ahead of Joel Corry & MNEK's chart-topper Head & Heart. However, the song has so far failed to break Spotify's UK Top 10, which means the band's streaming numbers could count against them when the final figures are compiled later this week. Dynamite comes six months after BTS's last studio album Map of the Soul: 7, which was released in February; and the band are due to perform it live at the MTV VMAs on 30 August.

"The action movie, based on the '70s TV series, sees the Angels fighting crime on behalf of their mysterious boss. It's the second time the brand has been rebooted for the big screen, following a 2000 film (and 2003 sequel) which starred Lucy Liu, Cameron Diaz and Drew Barrymore. According to Benjamin Lee of The Guardian, this ""ramshackle action reboot goes at half throttle"". He gives it three stars, writing: ""There's intermittent fun to be had in this throwaway relaunch of the female secret agent franchise but the party is cut short by incoherent action and a clunky script."" The latest reboot is written and directed by Elizabeth Banks, who also guides the trio as the experienced former angel, Bosley. The movie's theme song, Don't Call Me Angel, is performed by Ariana Grande, Miley Cyrus and Lana Del Rey. Kenneth Turan of the LA Times suggested the Charlie Angels reboot was ""a concept in search of a movie"", adding it ""does not take flight"" (pun intended, presumably). ""Charlie's Angels wants to take the venerable franchise in a new direction,"" he wrote. ""The goal is exemplary, the execution nothing to write home about."" Variety's Owen Gleiberman said that Stewart - who plays the wild and rebellious Sabina Wilson - ""anchors"" the movie, which throws up a ""divertingly up-to-the-minute fusion of guns and poses"". ""Most reboots are meaningless (time to rev that franchise back up!),"" he said. ""But the new Charlie's Angels, whether it turns out to be a glittering hit or the latest expensive package to get tossed by the audience onto the trash heap of franchise fatigue, feels like a generational rite of passage."" IndieWire's David Ehrlich suggested it confirms Stewart's place as a new ""comedy icon"". Their writer David Ehrlich called it a ""hilarious"" and ""kick-ass reboot"". The new movie also features appearances Djimon Hounsou, Noah Centineo, Sam Claflin and Sir Patrick Stewart. The last edition of the film series - 2003 sequel Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle, which also starred Diaz, Liu and Barrymore, received similarly mixed reviews and failed to hit the heights of its predecessor at the box office. This time around, The Hollywood Reporter's Beandrea July seemed to enjoy the ""fresh, feminist spin"" on the story, which also highlights environmental issues. ""Banks brings Charlie's Angels into the modern age with flair, all while unapologetically raising a feminist flag, championing female friendships and subtly making a point about the urgency of the ongoing climate crisis."" Last but not least, entertainment website Perri Nemiroff of Collider called it ""one of the most enjoyable franchise reboots of 2019.

Wilson said the unnamed star's male friends had attempted to film the incident before she left the room. She complained to the film studio about the encounter, but says she was later ""threatened by one of the star's representatives"". The Pitch Perfect actress also recounted a second incident which she described as a ""hotel room encounter with a top director"".

"By Mark SavageBBC Music reporter Talk Talk may have been lumped together with synth-pop bands like Duran Duran and Spandau Ballet. But singer Mark Hollis, who has died after a short illness aged 64, possessed a lyrical depth and musical curiosity that set him apart. By their fourth album, Spirit of Eden, he'd abandoned pop formulas in favour of ambient textures and jazz structures - setting a blueprint for bands who want to outgrow their origins. From the outset, Hollis's tastes were eclectic. His first record was the Northern Soul classic Everlasting Love, which he bought at the age of 12, while his first concert was David Bowie. Speaking to Record Mirror in 1982, he cited his main influences as Burt Bacharach and counterculture icon William Burroughs. He also said the best live show he'd ever seen was a performance of Shostakovich's Symphony No 10 at London's Royal Festival Hall. Those facts aside, little is known about Hollis's early life - mainly because of his tendency to tell tall tales in interviews. Born in Tottenham in north London in 1955, he told one journalist he'd dropped out of school before his A-Levels, while informing another he had studied child psychology at the University of Sussex. Upon leaving education, he claimed to have worked as a laboratory technician - but music was always his first love. ""I could never wait to get home and start writing songs and lyrics"" he told Kim magazine in 1983. ""All day long I'd be jotting ideas down on bits of paper and just waiting for the moment when I could put it all down on tape."" Duran comparisons Hollis formed his first band, The Reaction, in 1977 and recorded a demo for Island Records that included a song called Talk Talk Talk Talk. The group split after one single, after which Hollis intended to pursue a solo career. After writing a new batch of songs, he recruited Paul Webb, Lee Harris and Simon Brenner to help him flesh out the arrangements in the studio. ""But we liked what we were doing so much that we decided to throw every penny we had into hiring a rehearsal room and practicing to go out and play in the clubs,"" he said. The quartet soon had a name, Talk Talk, and a record deal with EMI Records, who hoped to mould them into another Duran Duran. The company even hired that band's producer, Colin Thurston, to work on their first two singles, Mirror Man and Talk Talk. But the band were keen to shake off the ""New Romantic"" tag, even dismissing their keyboard player to make it clear they weren't a synth-pop band. ""It gets tiring to listen to the Duran comparisons"" Hollis told Noise! magazine at the time. ""I can't hear it myself. ""I get depressed about the whole thing [because] kids ought to know about music, not image."" The band deliberately took a year to craft their second album, It's My Life, and even recorded animal noises at London Zoo for the title track. The video for the song was compiled from rushes of the David Attenborough series Life on Earth. It's My Life went on to become Talk Talk's biggest hit. A cover by No Doubt reached the US Top 10 in 2003. The year 1986 saw the release of The Colour of Spring, which hinted at their musical ambitions. Based on the strength of the singles Life's What You Make It and Give It Up, it became the band's biggest album to date. A year later, Talk Talk settled into an abandoned Suffolk church to begin working on their fourth LP. When they emerged 14 months later, it was hard to believe it was the same band. Drawing on ambient textures, jazz-like arrangements and stunning orchestral arrangements, Spirit of Eden is a meditative, melancholy six-song suite that's as downbeat as it is breathtaking. ""It's an engrossing, modern 'head' album, the kind of recording that Pink Floyd never became heavy enough to make,"" said The Times in a typically enthusiastic review. ""I'd never heard music that dynamic while being organic,"" wrote Elbow's Guy Garvey, who named Spirit of Eden his favourite album in a recent edition of Q Magazine. ""It's such a brave record. To this day, I can hear its influence."" The record performed poorly with audiences, however. EMI deleted it after three months and promptly dropped Talk Talk from their roster. Re-signing to Polydor, the band released one further album - the equally ambitious Laughing Stock - before quietly dissolving. ""There was no big split,"" Hollis later told The Times. ""By the end, everything was so loose that walking away didn't seem like a wrench. We'd reached an end point."" Hollis waited eight years before releasing his first, and only, solo album. Self-titled, nuanced and delicate, it was recorded with just two of microphones strategically placed to capture the musicians' every inflection, from gently caressed guitar strings to the creaking of their chairs. It ends with two minutes of analogue tape hiss. Perhaps he was always travelling towards silence. ""Before you play two notes, learn how to play one note, and don't play one note until you've got a reason to play it,"" he said in 1998, shortly before retreating from public life altogether. But there's something uniquely inspiring about a musician who puts a full stop on their career. There are no second-rate comeback albums or awkwardly staged reunions to taint Talk Talk's legacy. And that's presumably the way Hollis wanted it. Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

"NUJ and Bectu union members had voted in favour of industrial action in a row over pay. The walkout was to have started at midday on 23 July and last for 12 hours. The NUJ said 77% of its members voted for strike action, while 79% of Bectu staff came out in favour. Three hours of talks attended by union officials and BBC director general Tony Hall saw an improved pay offer in a two-year deal. The BBC had offered staff earning less than £50,000 a year an increase of £650, with those earning more than £50,000 receiving £500. The new deal includes the same offer, but adds an additional £150 payment on 1 January 2015 with a 2.5% salary increase on 1 August 2015. ""We welcome today's movement from management which means we now have a significantly improved offer which we believe our members should have the opportunity to consider in a ballot,"" Bectu general secretary Gerry Morrissey said. ""The truth is we've seen more movement from management in these negotiations this week, than we have seen in pay talks over the past five years."" A BBC spokesperson said: ""We're pleased that the unions have suspended their strike action in order to consult their members and we hope that we will now be able to resolve this dispute. ""We are now concentrating on delivering the best coverage of the Commonwealth Games for our audiences."" Union members will now vote on whether to accept the new offer.",Strike action by BBC staff planned to disrupt coverage of the Commonwealth Games opening ceremony has been suspended after talks.
"Musgraves won the coveted album of the year and best country album for Golden Hour while Gaga got two prizes for Shallow, from the movie A Star Is Born won two. Gambino's powerful This is America won song of the year and record of the year. There was also some British success with Dua Lipa winning best new artist and Ella Mai winning best R&B song for Bood's Up. Here are some other stand out moments from the awards. Camila kicks things off in style Demonstrating the power and prominence of Latin Pop, the opening number was a huge, West Side Story-inspired extravaganza, starring Camila Cabello, Ricky Martin, J Balvin and renowned Cuban-American trumpeter Arturo Sandoval. Cabello got the party started, performing Havana in a mock-up of her grandmother's childhood home in a canary yellow two-piece dress. After an intricate piece of handkerchief choreography (yes, that's a thing) Cabello ceded the stage to Martin, who performed his 2006 hit Pegate, followed by international sensation Balvin, with his smash Mi Gente. Flanked by dozens of dancers and a full Cuban salsa band, the performance sizzled and sparkled - throwing down a gauntlet to every other artist on the bill. If only the Grammys had scheduled it a year earlier, when Cabello and Balvin's songs were current and award-eligible, it would have been a masterstroke. Kacey Musgraves tops the leaderboard For the dual crimes of being musically progressive and female, Kacey Musgraves was essentially frozen out by country music radio in the US, which makes her album of the year win at the Grammys all the more delectable. The victorious album, Golden Hour, is a sensual and emotionally-candid record, written as she fell for her now-husband, Ruston Kelly, who she says opened her mind ""to a kind of love I never really envisioned for myself"". Although the record flirts with other genres, incorporating elements of psychedelia and disco, it's the timeless songcraft that will have won over the voters. ""I would have nothing without songs,"" said the star. ""It's all about the songs."" Drake finally appears - and rejects the concept of awards shows Drake notoriously boycotted previous Grammy ceremonies, withholding his records from consideration because he felt he was being unfairly sidelined in the rap categories. This year, he declined to perform despite an invitation from producers, so it must have seemed like a coup when he agreed to turn up on stage to accept the best rap song (natch) award for God's Plan. Think again. ""I want to take a moment to talk to the kids who want to do music,"" he said. ""I want to let you know that you play in an opinion-based sport. This a business where it's sometimes up to a bunch of people who might not understand what a mixed-raced kid from Canada might have to say. ""The point is, you've already won if people are singing your songs word for word. If there's people who have regular jobs who are coming out in the rain and the snow to see your show, you've already won."" (There may have been more but he was cut off mid-speech.) I bet he puts the award on his mantelpiece anyway. Dua, Gaga and Kacey Musgraves get top Grammys Childish Gambino makes Grammys history In pictures: Grammy winners and performances Grammy Awards 2019: List of winners Women take centre stage Following criticism that women were sidelined at the 2018 Grammys, this year's ceremony established its feminist credentials right from the beginning. Host Alicia Keys invited ""my sisters"" Lady Gaga, Jada Pinket-Smith and Jennifer Lopez onto the stage, alongside Michaelle Obama, who towered over them all. They each told a personal story of how music changed their life, with J-Lo saying it ""kept me moving from the Bronx to the big screen and the even bigger stages."" When it came to her turn, the former First Lady was drowned out by applause, and had to restart her speech. ""From the Motown records I wore out on the South Side, to the Who Run The World songs that fuelled me through the last decade, music helps me tell my story,"" she said. ""Music helps us share ourselves, our dignities and our sorrows. Music shows us all of it matters, every story with every voice, every note in every song."" ""Put your hands back in the air, don't be lazy"" Once a diva, always a diva, forever Ms Ross. Dua Lipa and St Vincent get steamy The pop stars' erotically-charged, serpentine performance gave off more sparks than a toaster on the fritz. St Vincent took to the stage first, showing off her inestimable guitar skills on a solo version of Masseduction. When Dua emerged from the shadows, they tarried on an excerpt of Aretha Franklin's Respect, ending with the British star purring ""sock it to me"" and launching into One Kiss. St Vincent scrawled fuzztone guitar over the formerly-pristine club hit, and it all got rather hot under the collar. Though not too hot as to trouble the censors. Bebe Rexha manages to get a dress Two weeks before the Grammys, best new artist nominee Bebe Rexha publicly criticised a number of designers for refusing to dress her because she was ""too big"". In a candid Instagram video, the star said fashion houses wouldn't work with her because she's a size 8 (UK size 12). In the aftermath, she received offers from Karl Lagerfeld and Monsoori, who she wore on the red carpet on Sunday. ""I feel like a princess,"" she said. ""I just did the video because I was heart-broken and I was really bummed out. I love my body and I want other girls to love their body."" According to Google, Rexha's dress was the most-searched gown of the night. Alicia Keys shows off What's the point of hosting an awards show if you can't use it for ridiculous wish fulfilment. Alicia Keys opened the second half of the Grammy ceremony sandwiched between two grand pianos, (one black, one white) playing Scott Joplin's Maple Rag Leaf with one hand on each keyboard. ""I always wanted to play two pianos,"" grinned the irritatingly dextrous star, before playing some of the songs that have inspired her through the years, including Nat King Cole's Unforgettable, Roberta Flack's Killing Me Softly, Ella Mai's Boo'd Up, Lauryn Hill's Doo Wop (That Thing) and Kings Of Leon's Use Somebody. ""Who doesn't wish they'd written this song?"" she asked of each of song. ""And then finally, you write the song you wished you'd wrote,"" she added, launching into Empire State Of Mind, her hit single with Jay-Z. Cardi B makes history A former stripper and Instagram personality, Cardi B arrived at rapping late in the day - but she grasped the opportunity with both hands. After scoring major crossover hits with Bodak Yellow, I Like It and the Bruno Mars collaboration Finesse, she made history on Sunday by becoming the first solo female to win best rap album. As she says on the single Money - which she performed on Sunday - ""I heard that Cardi went pop / That's me bustin' they bubble"". Gaga chokes back the tears The first televised prize of the night went to Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper, whose song Shallow (from A Star Is Born) won best pop duet. Holding back tears, Gaga paid tribute to her co-star ""who's over at the Baftas in the UK"" - where A Star Is Born also won best music. ""I'm so proud to be a part of a movie that addresses mental health issues,"" the star added. ""A lot of artists deal with that and we gotta take care of each other. So if you see someone that's hurting, don't look away."" Dolly's all-star tribute A who's who of country music joined Dolly Parton, who's been named the Grammys' ""person of the year"". Kacey Musgraves, Maren Morris, Little Big Town, Katy Perry and Parton's goddaughter Miley Cyrus took the stage for a feel-good run-through of her biggest hits, including 9 to 5 and Jolene. The highlight was a cover of Neil Young's After the Gold Rush, with Parton, Cyrus and Morris harmonising flawlessly in a spine-tingling a capella breakdown. But why did no-one consider calling the segment ""Dolly's mixtures""? J-Lo's monstrous Motown mash-up With a stunning acrobatic display, Jennifer Lopez paid tribute to the iconic US record label Motown with a medley of hits, including Dancing In The Street, Do You Love Me and Papa Was A Rolling Stone. She was joined briefly by Smokey Robinson (for My Girl), Alicia Keys and Ne-Yo but this was entirely J-Lo's show, dazzling in a diamante leotard and a feather-trimmed dress, as she pulled off a series of death-defying lifts and kicks. ""This is the music we listened to, me and my mom and my sisters,"" she said, recalling how they used to dance around the house, pretending to be The Supremes. ""I grew up on Motown and the musicals. I think that's why I'm the performer I am today."" Chris Cornell's kids accept a posthumous award The late singer's children, Toni and Christopher, took to the stage early on in the evening to accept the award for When Bad Does Good which won best rock performance. Wearing a t-shirt with her famous father - who took his own life in 2017 at the age of 52 - Toni said: ""I never thought we'd be standing here without my dad, he'd be proud and honoured, he was many things, a rock icon, the godfather of grunge"". Christopher called his ""one of the greatest poets of his time, the voice of a generation"". Toni added; ""His voice was his vision and his music was his peace, this is for you daddy and we love you so much."" Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

"By Emma SaundersEntertainment reporter Especially because, wouldn't you know it, both understudies had fallen ill. But never fear - help was (literally) just around the corner. The general manager of Mamma Mia! had remembered that one of the show's previous stars - Steph Parry - was currently working as an understudy in 42nd Street, which was playing just down the road. He called Steph, to ask whether she could step in, and within just 18 minutes of Mamma Mia! being halted, she was on the stage playing Donna - the role made famous in the film of the same name by Meryl Streep. As a stand-in for two of 42nd Street's leading roles, she was sitting in the dressing room at the Theatre Royal on Drury Lane when she got the call. The theatre is a hop and a skip from the Novello Theatre, the home of Mamma Mia!. ""The general manager told the audience: 'I'm really sorry, unfortunately Caroline has injured herself and is unable to carry on in the show and we have no understudy - however, we do have a lovely lady who will be carrying on for her shortly,'"" Steph explains. When the understudies took charge ""At the time, I didn't know [the audience announcement] was going to happen. It meant they were totally on my side and any nerves just went. They were willing me on."" But how on earth did she remember it all - the steps, the blocking (where to move) and the songs? (Although to be fair, we could probably all manage the latter - this is Abba we're talking about). ""Last time I played the role I was on a cruise ship and it was the US version of Mamma Mia! - the blocking and choreography are different, even the script is slightly different,"" says Steph. ""I didn't have time to worry, I just needed a wee! I remember sitting on the loo thinking about the lines for the next scene. After that I had no need to think, I just had to trust that it was somewhere in the back of mind. It was worse, the more I thought about!"" She says the dancing was the biggest challenge. ""The choreography was the biggest wing in the whole of my life - I blagged it!"" she says, adding: ""The cast were great, I knew they were on my side."" And there were other challenges - she only knew one or two of the actors. ""Jacqueline Braun, who plays Rosie, I'd never met before. She came up to me just before I went on and said: 'I just have to say hello, we're about to play best friends of 20 years, nice to meet you!'"" So how has she managed to carve out a career as the go-to understudy? ""My whole career has been [like that] - on my second night in Wicked I had to go on as Madam Morrible. My costume wasn't ready and I didn't have a wig! ""Ten years ago I was in the Pyjama Game in the Union Theatre - the lead role Babe lost her voice on the afternoon of the opening night, they had asked me to understudy the role but not officially. ""So I had to go on with a script! The next day, the director said I had to learn my lines for that night because 'Time Out were in'."" And the jobs kept coming. ""You get known as someone who is reliable. I'd love to be a leading role, that's where I'd like to be. But what's great is you do get the moment to save the day. Moments like that are so special."" And last week's performance was a particular career highlight. ""It was like nothing I've ever experienced in my life. At the end of Winner Takes It All, I felt like Celine Dion!"" But Steph says she is genuinely surprised by all the media attention. ""I didn't think it was anything special, I just did what I did. The publicity has blown me away.""

"By Tim MastersArts and entertainment correspondent The famous art museum, based in a former power station on London's South Bank, is undergoing a £260m revamp. When it opens in June 2016 it will boast an additional 10-storey building with a panoramic roof terrace. Tate director Sir Nicholas Serota said he was ""absolutely confident"" the money would be found. The new building will open to the public on 17 June, 2016. A day earlier, 5,000 school children from across the UK will attend a special preview event. Announcing the opening on Tuesday, Sir Nicholas said Tate Modern had been a ""catalyst for change"" in the UK's attitude to arts. ""When Tate Modern first opened [in 2000] none of us could have foreseen the extraordinary growth of the audience for contemporary art or the profound changes in the way that the audience would interact with the museum and indeed with art,"" he said. He said he expected the transformed Tate Modern to receive some six million visitors a year. In 2014-15 it received a record 5.7m people through its doors. The new development will provide 60% more display space and a ""complete rehang"" of the gallery's artworks will showcase more than 250 artists from about 50 countries. New acquisitions to be shown for the first time in 2016 include an installation of human hair and car bumpers by Sheela Gowda and an immersive multi-screen film by Cannes prize-winner Apichatpong Weerasethakul. Tate bosses describe the gallery's £260m revamp as ""one of the largest cultural fundraising campaigns ever launched"" with money coming from the Government, the Greater London Authority and private foundations and individuals."" In 2006, it was projected that the new building would cost £215m at 2012 prices. The rise in costs is attributed in part to renovation works on the existing building. ""They say that in London property is so expensive that you are better off building an extension to your house - so that's exactly what we did,"" said Lord Browne, chair of the Tate trustees. Sir Nicholas admitted he'd had ""plenty of sleepless nights"" because of the complexity of the construction project. ""We still have about £30m to raise. Both I and the trustees are absolutely confident that we will raise those funds. We've got a pretty good record of completing the fundraising for projects that we set out on."" Tate had record-breaking visitor figures of 7.9 million for the year 2014-2015. The figures - revealed in Tate's annual report - apply to its four galleries: Tate Britain, Tate Modern, Tate Liverpool and Tate St Ives. The figures mark a resurgence after 2013-2014, when visitor numbers fell to 7.03m from 7.74 million.","Tate bosses are confident they can raise £30m to complete funding for the new-look Tate Modern, which will open next year."
"Criticising the show's popularity in the US, he accused it of ""cultural necrophilia"" and of pandering to ""cliches"" about British stately homes. ""Downton serves up a steaming, silvered tureen of snobbery,"" he wrote in Newsweek magazine. Creator Julian Fellowes has previously defended the drama against such claims. Responding to people who accused the show of using anachronistic language and etiquette, he said ""the programme is pretty accurate"". ""The real problem is with people who are insecure socially, and they think to show how smart they are by picking holes in the programme to promote their own poshness and to show that their knowledge is greater than your knowledge,"" he added. Schama, who is professor of history at Columbia University, also blasted the show's stock characters such as stoic butler Carson and Dame Maggie Smith's overbearing matriarch, Violet, Dowager Countess of Grantham. ""The series is fabulously frocked, and acted, and overacted, and hyper-overacted by all the Usual Suspects in keeping with their allotted roles,"" he wrote. ""All the main plot lines were anticipated a long time ago by Upstairs, Downstairs."" 'Not history' Schama also took Fellowes to task over his portrayal of World War I in the most recent series. ""The abbey's conversion into convalescent quarters did indeed happen in some of the [stately homes],"" he wrote. ""But if Fellowes were really interested in the true drama... the story on our TV would be quite different. ""Instead of being an occasional suffragette, [Lady] Sibyl would have turned into a full-on militant. ""[And] Lord Robert, whose income from land and rents would have collapsed with the long agricultural depression, would be unable to service his mortgage."" His criticisms were targeted at the US, where the second series is currently showing. But the historian's description of the ""American craving for the British country house"" is reflected in US TV ratings. Downton Abbey remains the most popular British drama on US TV, regularly attracting more than four million viewers - significantly more than homegrown shows including Mad Men or Game Of Thrones. It also won a Golden Globe for best miniseries on Sunday night. Producer Gareth Neame defended the programme, saying it was not intended to be an historical documentary. ""Downton is a fictional drama,"" he said. ""It is not a history programme, but a drama of social satire about a time when relationships, behaviour and hierarchy were very different from those we enjoy today. ""As with any popular TV drama series, [it] offers an alternative to our own life experience.""","Historian Simon Schama has launched a scathing attack on Downton Abbey, accusing it of improbable storylines and historical inaccuracies."
"By Will GompertzArts Editor It starts with a disgruntled England, which has made a cataclysmic decision to break with an imperfect but effective Europe-entwined institution that has been the basis for the country's social, economic, and political life. We'd be better off without 'em, is the feeling. The Irish and Scots are not so sure, but the will of a group of charismatic and self-righteous metropolitan politicians prevails, and people are warily readying themselves for a collective leap into the dark. The population is divided on the matter, split like a pair of cheap trousers. The fact is this scepter'd isle is going to be run differently from now on. We stand poised. It is mid December. But we are not in 2017. We are in 1649 and, like it or not, the country is going to be a republic. The old monarchical system along with its network of tactical intercontinental marriages is over. Oliver Cromwell and his New Model Army rule, OK. Which brings us to the first painting in the show where we meet Charles I shortly before his execution, commissioned, apparently, by Cromwell and his chums. The incarcerated King looks wizard-like, nonchalant, and inwardly majestic. It is a respectful seated portrait suggesting the God-fearing Parliamentarian was uncomfortable doing away with a man widely believed to be hot-wired to God. It didn't stop him, though. As we see in an explicitly detailed image called The Execution of Charles I. This gory print became an instant blockbuster; a bloodthirsty hit both at home and throughout an intrigued and amazed Europe. Alongside it is a copy of a small book with a big title, Eikon Basilike: The Pourtraicture of His Sacred Majestie in His Solitudes and Sufferings. This is important. It is basically a mix of memoire, prayer, and personal statement, probably - but not definitely - written by Charles I shortly before his public beheading at Whitehall. What is certain is the date of its publication 10 days after the event, when it quickly became a bestseller and in-turn a cunning piece of beyond the grave Royalist propaganda. Maybe the King wasn't so bad after all. Maybe he was a martyr. And look at that lovely little woodcut image of him blessing his divine son as his chosen successor. The Restoration had begun in people's minds less than two weeks into the new Commonwealth. The exhibition then jump cuts to 1660 and the return of the exiled Charles II. Backed with parliamentary cash, the soon-to-be crowned King has been out on a shopping spree to replace all the regalia and formal royal tableware Cromwell had melted down and flogged off. It is a fine line the young man has to walk. His purchases need to be glitzy enough to impress and cement his status and legitimacy. But they can't be as flashy as the stuff his French cousin Louis XIV buys because: a) it might go down badly with the public and cost him his head, and b) he can't afford it. He opts for silver gilt, which nearly 360 years later still looks magnificent. The craftsmanship and quality of the plates, candlesticks, chalices, and salts are impressive. As is an exquisitely embroidered bible given to the newly restored King, signalling a more liberal, post-Cromwellian, era. The brakes are off. Theatres are re-opened. Charles II takes on a coterie of lovers (including the saucily depicted actress Nell Gwyn), and poses for a huge portrait by John Michael Wright. What the painting lacks in terms of technique - which is quite a lot - it more than makes up for with size and visual impact. It is designed to establish the new King as the top man. We see him sitting in an elevated position, wearing the crown of state, and sporting his Order of the Garter costume under Parliament robes. He is holding his newly acquired orb and sceptre. The idea is to hark back to Tudor and Elizabethan styles to imply stability through continuity. Frankly, he looks ridiculous; like an aging rock-star who has been allowed to rummage around in the royal dressing up box. It sums up what quickly becomes apparent in this show, which is Charles II was not blessed with the same curatorial eye as his late father. OK he acquired some wonderful drawings by Leonardo, Michelangelo and Holbein - some of which are on display. But when it came to the task of retrieving the great paintings Cromwell sold off, or commissioning new pictures, he comes up short. He did make a few decent purchases. You'll see a very good Pieter Bruegel the Elder painting called The Massacre of the Innocents. Although, it is slightly odd in so much as there are no innocents being massacred. There were originally, but when the Habsburg Emperor, Rudolf II, owned the painting he recognised the occupying troops as his own (specifically depicted as such by Bruegel, who was making a political point) and had all the dead babies painted out. The upshot is a scene in which women are bent over, crying their eyes out over loaves of bread and various poultry. If you're after an exhibition stuffed to its royal gunnels with painterly masterpieces, the chances are you'll be underwhelmed by Charles II: Art & Power and should wait until January when the Royal Academy will do what he didn't and reunite much of his father's collection. If, however, you are in the market for a richly told, thought-provoking history lesson that feels surprisingly relevant in today's Brexit Britain, with the added bonus that its central protagonist looks like Brian May from Queen, then you might consider the £11 ticket price as money well spent. Charles II: Art and Power is at The Queen's Gallery, Buckingham Palace, London SW1A.",There is something hauntingly contemporary about this exhibition.
"By Kev GeogheganArts and entertainment reporter So claims the mysteriously-named Emo of Californian R&B merchants Emotional Oranges ahead of their first UK show. Alongside his equally mysteriously named singer V, Emo fronts the musical collective, who are number 78 in our Newbie Tuesday list and who released their debut EP The Juice Vol I earlier this year. While the band don't make any attempt to hide their faces à la Daft Punk or Slipknot, very little has been written about who they are outside the sweaty four-piece who fill out a sweaty venue in east London with sweaty people who know every word of their sweaty, sultry pop songs. So why bother with all the mystery? ""I mean, in all honesty, I came from a genuine place of like wanting to live a normal life. I have a girlfriend, our singer I actually met through my best friend, they were dating at the time,"" explains Emo. ""My co-producer, he's a coder in his day job. Our guitar player's a teacher. It's not like you come to the show and you don't see our faces, like, it's pretty clear. If you're in the first three or four rows, you'll see my face. ""And I'm not gonna lie, a few people have found our personal Instagram accounts, like die hard kind of cult fans after they've seen the shows. But we're never going to be like, 'Oh my God, here are the people behind Emotional Oranges'."" Emotional Oranges are far from the first band to try to keep their real lives and often their actual faces, away from prying eyes. Daft Punk's Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo are rarely pictured without their famous robot helmets, while Slipknot never perform without their grotesque rubber masks. And DJs DeadMau5 and Marshmellow wouldn't be caught dead without their signature disguises. ""You mention Daft Punk. I think that's a really great example of, you know, their anonymity is their protection,"" says Emo ""There are people that are doing it that I'm not really a fan of but I'm not even gonna put the negativity out there,"" he adds. ""You want to do it in a timeless way so that in 20 years, when all of us have kids, and we're older, it's like, we look back, and we're proud of what we've done."" If their private lives remain shrouded in mystery, their music has been gathering pace thanks, in part, to their track Motion, which was selected as the official theme song for Ru Paul's Drag race in 2018. Its laid back 80s soul groove occupies a similar space to artists like Canadian R&B chartbuster The Weeknd and British neo-soul collective Jungle. Their track Hold You Back, about a bisexual love triangle, sees Emo and V sing back and forth, sounding for all the world like The xx if Romy and Oliver swapped their guitars for synths. ""I think, when you look at R&B music, it's extremely difficult to find a male and female duo,"" says Emo. ""I'm re-mixing a song right now by Groove Theory, you know, their classic Tell Me and that's like the last time I remember and it wasn't even two singers it was a singer and a rapper. It's exciting and hasn't been done for a while. According to their official biog, EO met a couple of years ago ""when Adele's vocal coach and Drake's engineer met at a bar mitzvah"". And apparently Michelle Obama is a fan. Emo describes the band's inspirations as ""everything from The 1975 to Anderson. Paak to Frank Ocean"". ""There's two sides to us, there's the DJ side, some of the house influences and old school R&B, and there's the live side which all four of us participate in. ""Our singer went to theatre school and when you hear her singing like that, that's what it sounds like live, if not better. Her dancing and her choreography... yeah's she's brilliant."" Emo is keen to point out EO are more than just a band, the term ""collective"" is more appropriate. He even has a ""creative guy"". ""He's done everything from Gallant to now working with Travis Scott, and Frank Ocean has commissioned a couple of pieces from him. ""It's just an eclectic group of people that do different things.""

"The Wolf Hall author will be presented with the Bodley Medal for outstanding achievement in literature on 24 March. Mantel drew criticism this week over a lecture she gave earlier this month in which she made observations about the Duchess of Cambridge. ""Princess Kate"", she said, resembled a ""mannequin"" with ""a plastic smile"". ""Kate Middleton, as she was, appeared to have been designed by a committee and built by craftsmen,"" Mantel said during a speech given at the British Museum on 4 February. The reporting of her comments prompted Prime Minister David Cameron to say she was ""completely misguided"", though some claimed she had been quoted out of context. Actor Rupert Everett, art critic Brian Sewell and former Labour cabinet minister Jack Straw will also appear at this year's festival, which runs from 16 to 24 March. Children's author Philip Pullman will receive the festival's honorary fellowship, an accolade given in previous years to William Boyd, Kazuo Ishiguro, and PD James.","Two-time Booker winner Hilary Mantel will be honoured once more next month at the 2013 Oxford Literary Festival, organisers have announced."

"By Emma SaundersEntertainment reporter As the third - and final - series goes to air, writer Stefan Golaszewski says age wasn't a barrier to creating the Bafta-winning series. ""I'm 38, the age thing doesn't really matter, or gender... things like race, religion, sexuality, they're all just the circumstances - what I'm interested in is the individual,"" he says. The subtle comedy revolves around the life of suburban mum Cathy (Phantom Thread's Lesley Manville) as she grieves for her recently deceased husband and subsequently embarks on a will-they-won't-they relationship with family friend Michael (Tyrannosaur's Peter Mullan). ""What interested me was the things Cathy's going through - the experiences of women, the societal expectation of them, it's so much more demanding,"" says Golaszewski, who also created BBC Three sitcom Him & Her. ""That creates immediate tension in the character. Cathy's story is a search for freedom and individuality."" Cathy is certainly the put-upon traditional mum, who is often taken for granted by her nearest and dearest - not least her son Jason (Sam Swainsbury) and his girlfriend Kelly (Lisa McGrillis), who are infuriating and hysterical in equal measure. Manville invites the viewer to peel back the layers and discover there's a lot more to Cathy than meets the eye. ""She's very patient and non-judgemental with a huge sense of humour and a twinkle,"" Manville says. She was attracted to the part by Cathy's story, which the Oscar-nominated actress describes as ""a quiet unravelling... there's not a lot said"". Golaszewski's sparse dialogue is the result of a painstaking exercise, he explains. ""I know the narrative... then I just start writing quite quickly... then it's a process of rewriting... until it doesn't look like it's written, it's just people chatting. The words are just part of the setting, like the costumes etc. [I want] to have as few [words] as possible."" The role has found Manville a new audience, as she was previously best known for her theatre career and film collaborations with Mike Leigh. ""I get clocked for Mum more than anything. The response is always quite gentle. It's been quite remarkable,"" she says. ""It's a story about middle-aged people falling in love and looking like teenagers and that's not dealt with very much. It's real, normal, unglamorous. It's very refreshing."" Mullan, who recently starred in Ozark, also applauds Golaszewski's writing: ""Film and TV are almost indistinguishable now, technically and in terms of the audience. When the writing's as strong as this, obviously you say yes."" The first two series of Mum each chronicled a year, with the drama taking place in the family home in Chingford. Golaszewski says this ""seemed appropriate with what she [Cathy] was going through [following her husband's death]"". But it's all change for the final series, with the action taking place as the family - plus Michael - gather at a fancy holiday home hired by Cathy's snobby sister-in-law Pauline (played by Dorothy Atkinson). And this time, the season charts the events of just one week. ""It required a shorter timeline,"" Golaszewski says. ""The journey Cathy goes on would be harder to go on in her house, with ghosts in every corner."" That journey is the tentative yet tender relationship that has developed between Cathy and Michael and Manville says it's had an emotional impact on the actors as well as the audience. ""In series two, when Michael comes in to tell Cathy his mother's died... it was hard for all of us, you get drawn in... Peter was so heartbreaking in that moment, you can't help it. ""It's been a big deal this job. It feels very significant because of all the ingredients being so good, the writing, directing... and extraordinary actors. That cocktail is quite rare,"" Manville says. ""It's part of a great wave of comedy. I think it's just a great time we're in. How great to make you laugh one minute and cry the next. It's very close to my heart."" The quiet, slow-burning BBC Two sitcom Mum may be about to shout a bit louder - this weekend, the series is nominated for three Baftas, having picked up a Bafta Craft award for best comedy writing in 2017. Whether it wins or not, fans will be sad to see the series draw to a conclusion. Being careful not to give anything away, Mullan says: ""I think it finishes as it should. The ending felt very natural, not forced or contrived, it doesn't tie everything up."" Manville concurs: ""There's a feeling that life goes on.""

"The Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Choir's song A Bridge Over You topped the chart ahead of Bieber's Love Yourself. The choir overtook Bieber after he had urged his 72 million Twitter followers to buy the charity single. He tweeted: ""Just heard the news. Amazing. That is what Christmas is all about. @Choir_NHS congrats! Very cool."" Johnson, who had been the bookmakers' favourite, could only manage 12th position. Her cover of Bob Dylan's Forever Young dropped three places since entering the chart last week - meaning it is likely to be the first X Factor winner's single to fail to reach the top spot. Instead, the NHS Choir's mash-up of Simon and Garfunkel's Bridge Over Troubled Water and Coldplay's Fix You emerged as the popular favourite in the run-up to Christmas. The choir, which features physiotherapists, porters and administrators as well as doctors and nurses, were runners up on Gareth Malone's BBC Two show Sing While You Work in 2012. They recorded A Bridge Over You to celebrate the work of the NHS, and all proceeds from the sales will be shared between charities including Carers UK and Mind. ""We are absolutely overwhelmed and couldn't be any happier,"" they said in a statement released by the Official Charts Company. ""It's a brilliant celebration for the NHS across the country so well done and thank you everyone for downloading and streaming. A massive cheer for the NHS, thank you."" The Official Charts Company said it was the closest Christmas number one race since Rage Against the Machine beat X Factor winner Joe McElderry in 2009. The choir were trailing Bieber in the chart race earlier in the week, but pulled ahead of the Canadian pop star after he asked his fans to support their cause. He told them to ""do the right thing"" and help A Bridge Over You win, conceding that ""for one week it's OK not to be number one"". He added: ""This is what it's all about. Merry Christmas."" In the end, the NHS Choir achieved 127,000 sales, while Bieber's Love Yourself had sales and streams equivalent to 97,000 copies. Official Charts Company chief executive Martin Talbot said: ""What a fantastic result for the NHS Choir to claim the 2015 Christmas number one. ""There will be thousands of NHS staff across the country working through Christmas Day, while the rest of the nation is putting its feet up - this success is for them. There couldn't be a more deserving group of winners."" Christmas classics Despite missing out on Christmas number one, Bieber still has three tracks - Love Yourself, Sorry and What Do You Mean - in the top five. At number four, Adele's Hello is also in the top five, while grime artist Stormzy has reached number nine with Shut Up. The Christmas classics in this week's chart are led by Mariah Carey's All I Want For Christmas at number 11, with The Pogues' Fairytale Of New York at 13, Wham's Last Christmas at 18 and Shakin' Stevens' Merry Christmas Everyone at 26. Elsewhere in the top 40, Wizzard's I Wish It Could Be Christmas Every Day is at 27, Chris Rea's Driving Home For Christmas is at 29 and Band Aid's Do They Know It's Christmas is number 38.","A choir of nurses, doctors and other NHS staff have beaten Justin Bieber and X Factor winner Louisa Johnson to the UK's Christmas number one spot."
"By Mark SavageBBC Music reporter The court upheld a 2015 verdict against the stars, which means Gaye's family will get to keep a $5m (£3.5m) payout. In addition, the family will receive 50% of future royalties from Blurred Lines. Yet one judge dissented from the verdict, saying the two songs ""differed in melody, harmony and rhythm"". Circuit Judge Jacqueline Nguyen added that the ruling ""strikes a devastating blow to future musicians and composers everywhere"". In the original 2015 trial, a jury found that Blurred Lines had copied Gaye's 1977 hit Got To Give It Up - despite many observers claiming the songs were only similar in feel, rather than composition. Thicke, Williams and rapper TI, who contributed a verse to the track, launched an appeal in 2016 and were backed by 212 fellow songwriters, among them John Oates, Jason Mraz and members of Linkin Park. They argued the verdict ""threaten[ed] to punish songwriters for creating new music that is inspired by prior works."" But the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals largely upheld the decision, while clearing TI - real name Clifford Harris Jr - of any copyright infringement. The judges rejected Williams and Thicke's request to order a new trial, saying Gaye's copyright was entitled to broad protection. They also accepted the original judge's decision to instruct the jury to reach their verdict based only on the sheet music to the songs and not the recordings. You can see the full ruling here. Wednesday's decision prompted a strong dissent from Circuit Judge Jacqueline Nguyen. She said the decision let the Gayes ""accomplish what no one has before: copyright a musical style"" and expanded the potential for further copyright litigation. ""The Gayes, no doubt, are pleased by this outcome,"" she wrote. ""They shouldn't be. ""They own copyrights in many musical works, each of which (including Got To Give It Up) now potentially infringes the copyright of any famous song that preceded it. ""That is the consequence of the majority's uncritical deference to music experts."" 'A victory for musicians' Howard King, a lawyer for Thicke and Williams, said Judge Nguyen's comment ""enhances the prospects"" his clients might prevail in an appeal. ""These are two entirely different songs,"" he said. Two of Gaye's children, Frankie and Nona, called the decision ""a victory for the rights of all musicians."" Their mother Jan added it was a ""wonderful recognition of Marvin's creativity and the lasting value of one of his greatest songs."" Musicologists have reacted with disappointment to the ruling, saying it might hinder creativity in the future. Joe Bennett, a professor at Berklee College of Music, wrote a note-by-note comparison of the two songs in 2014 and concluded they only shared a groove. ""What they have in common is indicative of the time period,"" he told Forbes this week. ""If my favourite artist uses a cowbell and I use one too, can you copyright the cowbell? Both are arguing that their side is good for creators. ""That's why so many of the young songwriters are concerned. What's the threshold? How much can I be influenced by my favourite artist?"" 'Horrible precedent' Since the Blurred Lines trial, there have been a number of similar cases against such artists as Bruno Mars, Ed Sheeran, Madonna and Miley Cyrus. Others have sought to pre-empt any copyright claims - including Taylor Swift, who gifted Right Said Fred a writing credit on her single Look What You Made Me Do after noticing a passing similarity to their hit I'm Too Sexy. Meanwhile, Thicke, Williams and TI issued a joint statement about Wednesday's ruling, claiming it set a ""horrible precedent"". ""Blurred Lines was created from the heart and minds of Pharrell, Robin and TI and not taken from anyone or anywhere else,"" they said.

"Known by her fans as the ""Queen of Suspense"", Ms Clark sold more than 100 million books in the US alone. In a career spanning decades, she wrote best sellers such as A Stranger is Watching and The Cradle will Fall, both of which were adapted into films. Her publishing company Simon & Schuster said she died peacefully ""surrounded by family and friends."" Ms Clark was born in 1927 in New York City. She briefly worked as a Pan Am flight attendant, leaving the job after a year to marry Warren Clark and start a family. The couple had five children together. However, Mr Clark died suddenly when she was 35. In order to support her family, Ms Clark began writing short stories and radio scripts. But her agent persuaded her to turn her attention on novels. Her books have been translated into 35 languages. Her first book, titled Where are the Children?, was reprinted 75 times. Many of her storylines were drawn from news stories. She attended murder trials and discussed medical terminology with doctors, according to the Washington Post. In 2000, her publishing company awarded her a $64m (£48m) contract for her next five books, making her at the time, the highest-paid female author in the world. ""Nobody ever bonded more completely with her readers than Mary did,"" her editor Michael Korda said in a statement. ""She understood them as if they were members of her own family. She was always absolutely sure of what they wanted to read - and perhaps more important, what they didn't want to read - and yet she managed to surprise them with every book.""","Bestselling author Mary Higgins Clark has died aged 92, her publisher confirmed."
"Arts Council England said the ENO must now improve its business model or face funding cuts. It said it would review the ENO's finances over the next two years and ""set rigorous milestones"" for progress. ENO's chairman and executive director both recently stepped down. Martyn Rose's departure was announced in January, with Henriette Gotz resigning a few days later. 'Commercial programming' Althea Efunshile, acting chief executive of Arts Council England, said: ""No one is doubting that ENO is capable of extraordinary artistic work but we have serious concerns about their governance and business model and we expect them to improve or they could face the removal of our funding."" Last year the organisation had its annual funding cut by 29% as part of a shake-up of how the Arts Council distributes its money. The ENO is moving towards more commercial programming that will see it stage musical theatre productions, among them Sweeney Todd with Bryn Terfel and Emma Thompson. Analysis: Will Gompertz, Arts editor The Arts Council's decision to eject the English National Opera from the National Portfolio is a big deal. It's way beyond the naughty corner, and to extend the school analogy, it has been put in to special measures. I can't think of another instance where there has been such a dramatic move made that imperils one of Britain's major arts institutions. The problem, as I understand it, is the ambitions of the artistic director are not aligned to what Arts Council England believes is achievable with its budget. They are demanding a different mix in programming, a strong chief executive and serious consideration as to the whether a full-time orchestra and chorus are required. The ""special funding"" represents what the ENO would have received in the first two of the three years of funding it would have been given had it remained in the national portfolio. The acting chair of ENO, Harry Brunjes, said it was ""very grateful"" to Arts Council England and would ""continue to work closely with [it] to inspire confidence in our future plans"". The ENO, which operates out of the Coliseum in London, will receive £30.5m over the next two years - annual core funding of £12.38m, plus additional transition grants amounting to £6.55m. Arts Council England said the money would ""enable [ENO] to operate and make changes to its business model"". ""All companies offered national portfolio status must demonstrate their business plans and their governance are robust enough to ensure the organisations are sustainable over a three-year funding term,"" it said in a statement. In the case of ENO, it said, ""the Arts Council has continuing concerns which it wants to see addressed"". Earlier this year, the Sunday Times published the contents of a letter in which Martyn Rose called for the sacking of John Berry, the ENO's artistic director. Originally named the Sadler's Wells Opera Company, the ENO adopted its current name in 1974, six years after making the London Coliseum its home. The company describes its mission as one of ""creating new audiences for opera through English language performances which are affordable and accessible to everyone"".","The English National Opera (ENO) has been dropped from the Arts Council's national portfolio of organisations for 2015-18 and placed ""under special funding arrangements""."
"By Ian YoungsEntertainment & arts reporter From marriage break-up to literally losing the shirt off his back, the character Goss plays in The Loss Adjuster is put through pretty much every misery that can be thrown his way. ""He's truthfully at the limit of his life in the sense of what he can take,"" says Goss of Martin, a hollow-eyed insurance assessor. He points out The Loss Adjuster does become an uplifting story and is a comedy. ""A dark comedy in some ways,"" he adds. ""But I know how that feels, as most men do, where they've gone to that point where there's that moment of crisis within their own prowess, financially or in their work or whatever, and it's a moment of reinvention."" Goss has reinvented himself as an actor in Los Angeles since the days when he and twin brother Matt ruled the pop world as boy band Bros in the late 1980s and early 90s. Luke now has 60 film credits to his name, including Blade II, Hellboy II: The Golden Army and now The Loss Adjuster. ""It's a movie about, by standing a little taller, having some self-belief and being very candid in regards of wanting to be an authentic self, you can find a victory or two, and I think that might be needed right now,"" he says. Flirting with Joan Collins The film also stars Kym Marsh, Martin Kemp, Lorna Fitzgerald and Dame Joan Collins. Indeed, just about the only good thing to happen to poor Martin on his way to rock bottom is being hit on by Dame Joan's glamorous widow. ""Listen, any man who doesn't want to get hit on by Joan Collins is a fool,"" Goss laughs. ""She's beautiful and she's so professional."" Perhaps the best that can be said about the film is that it has some poignant, heartwarming and humorous moments. It's a bit of a departure for Goss, who has had more success as an actor in action films. Yet he bristles at the suggestion that he hasn't flexed his feelings on screen. ""Some of the roles I've done have involved such a lot of tears,"" he says. ""I think it's very important to show tears in a man because we do cry, and one can also recover."" When was the last time he cried in real life? ""About four days ago,"" he replies after a short pause. ""I miss my family. I miss my best friends. I don't have family in Los Angeles, and Matty's in Vegas. ""So when you've had two hours sleep for a week and a half, and you've got the noise of life, and you don't see people… I might go and sit on the balcony at three in the morning and just let a couple of quiet ones fall out."" He was attracted to The Loss Adjuster by a philosophical metaphor at the start of the film, about a man who falls out of a plane and is stripped of all his clothes and belongings on his way down but ends up with a smile on his face. ""It's what got me when I read the script,"" Goss says. Has he felt like that man? ""I'm there now,"" he says. ""I know what's important."" It is two years since Goss was seen telling viewers of the Bros documentary After the Screaming Stops about how he had gone ""from superstar to both broke and deemed as useless"". He recounted the journey from being chased by hordes of screaming girls to having his two cars towed away three days after leaving the band, and having to ask his wife for her engagement ring to raise the money to keep the family going. Brothers 'closer than ever' The documentary also captured the tense build-up to Luke and Matt's stage comeback in 2017. Their bickering, pearls of wisdom and underlying brotherly love made the film a cult hit - and a source of mirth for some. But there was ""no down side"" to taking part, Goss says. The twins are now ""closer than ever"" with ""a loving relationship"". ""And now Bros is back in the sense that we're planning the new album,"" he continues. It will be the first Bros album for 30 years. ""We're coming up with our individual songs that we're going to mush together,"" he expands. ""The definitive Bros album is coming up. We're working on it next year. And that might not have happened before [the documentary]."" In After the Screaming Stops, Luke was also seen discussing how he felt the UK had turned on him when the band fell apart, and how ""Bros has never been something that the country has been proud of"". The documentary helped heal that scar too, he says. ""I always hoped there was a magic pill out there where I could get on with my countrymen and that there would be great support. ""Who would have thought a documentary would fix family issues, but it did. It was a magic pill for the country for us, and a magic pill within our creative communication. It was a big, big, big benefit for our lives."" The new Bros album isn't likely to bear much resemblance to the group's original clean-cut pop. Goss, wearing his favourite Foo Fighters T-shirt, hopes it will sound like ""a soulful [Led] Zeppelin"". He has been writing music on his own, using Instagram to post occasional songs that he strums on his balcony. Before Bros go back into the studio, Luke will release a rare solo single titled Free on 11 December. After knowing what it's like to reach rock bottom, it's another moment of reinvention. ""I'm very proud of this music,"" he says. ""It's the first music I've ever made that is entirely my taste without compromise, so it's a big statement. It's me being me.""

"By Mark SavageBBC News entertainment reporter All five attended the launch of the ""jukebox musical"" Viva Forever! which features hits such as Wannabe and Stop. Written by Jennifer Saunders, it tells the story of a girl band who pursue stardom on a reality TV series. After the show, the Spice Girls took to the stage, where Mel C thanked the ""wonderful"" cast, saying: ""I think they've done a pretty good job."" Although Sporty Spice (aka Melanie Chisholm), Scary (Melanie Brown), Baby (Emma Bunton), Posh (Victoria Beckham) and Ginger (Geri Halliwell) do not appear as characters in Viva Forever, the plot - in which four friendships are tested by fame - resonates with the Spice story. The band achieved global fame almost overnight with the release of Wannabe in 1996, but within two years, Halliwell had quit, saying through her lawyer: ""This is because of differences between us."" The quintet have since reconciled, staging a comeback tour in 2007, but Halliwell admitted that watching the show ""does bring up a lot of feelings"". ""I felt a little bit tearful,"" she told the BBC. Beckham, who watched the performance with her husband, David, and three sons, thanked Saunders for the script, and paid tribute to her family. ""I love you all,"" she said, before gesturing to her bandmates. ""And well done the girls."" Viva Forever! shares much of its DNA with Mamma Mia! - the hugely successful ABBA musical which has taken more than £1.2bn at the box office since in 1999. Both shows were produced by Judy Cramer, and both feature a strong female cast, in this case led by Hannah John-Kamen in the role of aspiring pop star Viva, and Sally Ann Triplett as her adoptive mother. Where the two shows differ is in the strength of the band's back catalogue. While Mamma Mia! opens up with a triptych of sing-along classics, the Spice show begins with Let Love Lead The Way and Right Back At Ya, two songs from the band's little-loved third album, Forever - the one without Ginger Spice. In fact, it takes almost 30 minutes to get to a bona fide hit - the Motown pastiche Stop - with most of the big numbers reserved for the second half. Early reviews in the Guardian and the Independent have both focused on the lack of showstoppers. ""The lyrics are required to drive the action on,"" noted Alexis Petridis in the Guardian, ""and the lyrics of Spice Girls songs are appalling"". Nonetheless, the audience for the premiere - which included Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber, Joan Collins, Cilla Black, Holly Willoughby, Dawn French and Graham Norton - was enthusiastic, with the best reception reserved for a 10-minute megamix performed during the curtain call. Halliwell noted: ""It's mind-blowing when you see something that we wrote in a little, tiny cold studio over 14 years ago, and then this West End cast is singing our songs. We're so proud."" Speaking after the show, Saunders said she ""was very pleased"" to see it come to fruition after three years of work. ""It's a relief but I hope it won't stop now, because I've enjoyed it so much. I'll probably still call in every couple of weeks and hope they still know who I am."" The cast, meanwhile, said performing in front of the original Spice Girls had been ""nerve-wracking and exciting"". ""We all stood at half time peering out of the curtains, working out where everybody was,"" said Hatty Preston, who had all the show's best comedic lines as Minty, a ditzy PA on a reality TV show. The actress, making her West End debut, said she had grown up listening to the Spice Girls. ""I still hadn't really reconciled myself to the idea that they're actually real people,"" she told the BBC. ""I think, in my head, they were always just these superheroes that exist somewhere else. And they are the nicest, chilled out, lovely group of girls. It was very overwhelming."" That's exactly the sort of reaction the producers of Viva Forever! will be banking on from their paying customers, if they hope to see the show spread as far as Mamma Mia! - which now has productions in more than 16 different languages. Outside the Piccadilly Theatre, many of them had turned up to see their idols arrive - chanting ""we want Spice"" and singing the chorus to Mama over and over again. Speaking to the BBC, Chisholm said the band's lasting appeal had a simple explanation. ""We were really honest, and we really spoke from our hearts. We loved working together and writing music together, and we feel really lucky that people identified with us.""",The Spice Girls have reunited in London for the world premiere of a West End show based on their hits.
"It will be the second feature film for the director, who rose to fame under her maiden name, Taylor-Wood. She previously helmed 2009's Nowhere Boy, the account of John Lennon's youth starring her husband Aaron Johnson. The 50 Shades trilogy by author EL James has sold more than 70 million copies around the world. The novels tell the story of the sadomasochistic relationship between billionaire businessman Christian Grey and ""unworldly, innocent"" literature student Anastasia Steele. ""I am excited to be charged with the evolution of Fifty Shades of Grey from page to screen,"" Taylor-Johnson said. ""For the legions of fans, I want to say that I will honour the power of Erika's book and the characters of Christian and Anastasia. They are under my skin too.""

"WARNING: This story contains spoilers. It was the most-watched television programme on Tuesday night, beating Channel 4's Great British Bake Off. Suranne Jones reprises her role as Gemma Foster, which earned her a Bafta. The new series sees the GP's cheating ex-husband Simon - played by Bertie Carvel - return to his former home town with his new wife. The BBC One show drew an average audience of 6.3 million viewers - slightly higher than Bake Off's average of six million viewers. Channel 4's figures include those watching on +1. The Independent Sean O'Grady says Jones is in contention for another Bafta and praises Mike Bartlett's ""skilfully rendered"" script. He says the set pieces, including a ""wedding party debacle"" and a ""surprise Interflora package"" with a rude message were ""all done stylishly"" and that the title sequence ""drew us delicately into this middle class emotional hellhole"". O'Grady has problems with Gemma's nemesis, Kate however. He writes: ""I hate to say it, but Doctor Foster was also a bit compromised by the fact that the older (40 or so) woman is actually at least as attractive, smart and elegant as the younger (25 years old) usurper, Kate, played with well-calibrated naivety by Jodie Comer, who has only chronology on her side."" The Guardian's Lucy Mangan says she was gripped. ""An hour of the five in and I've already had so much fun I can barely type,"" she writes. ""Simon drives up to the front door in a shiny new car. He smirks more smirkingly than anyone has ever smirked before to find her there, before delivering the most perfect pass-agg speech ever penned (I mentally prostrated myself at the feet of writer Mike Bartlett then and never really rose thereafter)."" Viewers of the show were also quick to take to Twitter. Many were questioning the loyalty of Gemma's co-worker Ros, who promised not to go to ex-husband Simon's wedding party but was later outed. One fan describes Gemma's colleague Ros as a ""snake"". Simon was also at the wrath of social media users - with many describing him in terms too colourful to publish.

"The untitled DreamWorks film is being produced by Spielberg who is also said to be considering a directing role, according to Variety. Hanks and Spielberg have previously teamed up for Saving Private Ryan, Catch Me if You Can and The Terminal. The new project is about real-life US lawyer James Donovan, who was enlisted by the CIA during the Cold War. Hanks will play Donovan, who had to negotiate the release of a pilot captured when his U2 spy plane was shot down over Russia. DreamWorks has declined to comment, but the film is thought to be one of several directing projects being considered by Spielberg, who is already producing the film along with Marc Platt. Other possibilities are Robopocalypse and the historical drama Montezuma, from American Gangster and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo writer Steve Zaillian.

"The play, which was adapted from the hit 1997 film about hard-up Sheffield steelworkers, opened on 20 February and was due to run until 14 June. But its last performance at the Noel Coward Theatre will now be on 29 March. Producers producers David Pugh and Dafydd Rogers said ""not enough of a West End audience"" had bought tickets. The show was recently nominated for an Olivier Award for best new comedy and had also received glowing reviews from critics. In a Facebook post on Sunday, actor Kenny Doughty, who plays Gaz, wrote: ""I'm devastated and heartbroken. ""Yesterday, on the day we had two full houses and two standing ovations, in the week our play got an Olivier nomination, we were given the shocking news that the play is being pulled. ""We were summoned to a full company call on stage immediately after curtain call - you could still hear the whoops and cheers from the audience behind the curtain as the producer gave us our two weeks notice. ""I am utterly devastated not only for myself but for every single soul that has given their all for this play. I am so incredibly proud of this play and everybody in the Full Monty company. ""We delivered night after night. The audiences loved it. We got amazing reviews. An Olivier nomination... We deserved better."" 'A certified smasheroo' The news puzzled some critics, who expected the play to be a hit. The Stage newspaper's Mark Shenton wrote that he was ""amazed"" by the announcement. ""I'm not saying that it was any kind of theatrical masterpiece, but it had all the ingredients for what I imagined would make it a certified smasheroo: an already beloved title, a smashing production, and the titillating promise of a bit of male nudity. What could go wrong?"" In his review in The Telegraph on 25 February, critic Charles Spencer wrote: ""If ever a show had 'big hit' written all over it then it is this wonderfully entertaining and deeply touching stage version of the successful British film The Full Monty."" Even The Guardian's Michael Billington, whose two-star review described it as ""a missed opportunity"", also declared: ""I've no doubt it will go on to make a packet."" The play originated at Sheffield's Lyceum theatre in February 2013 before going on tour. It went on to win the UK Theatre Award for best touring production. A statement from David Pugh and Dafydd Rogers said: ""It is with great sadness that this show will close despite having played to packed houses on its UK tour. ""Simply not enough of a West End audience shared in the excitement of this terrific production."" 'Disappointed' A further UK tour will go ahead, beginning in Manchester on 11 September, they added. Sheffield Theatres chief executive Dan Bates said: ""We are disappointed that, despite glorious reviews in Sheffield and London, The Full Monty will be closing earlier than planned in the West End. ""However, we're proud to have produced such an exceptional show."" The Full Monty's demise follows recent early closures for other new West End shows. Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical Stephen Ward, about the figure at the centre of the Profumo scandal in the 1960s, will shut on 29 March after less than four months. Sir Tim Rice's latest project From Here to Eternity will also close on 29 March after a six-month run, with Sir Tim saying ""we haven't had the numbers of audience that we'd hoped for"". Last summer, the curtain came down on Spice Girls musical Viva Forever after six months following poor sales and damning reviews.","The West End version of The Full Monty is to close after five weeks, two-and-a-half months earlier than planned, due to poor ticket sales."
"By Mark SavageBBC music reporter Writing on Instagram, the star criticised ""female writers"" who have attacked her for ""glamorising abuse"". She said her lyrics often talked about ""the realities"" of emotionally abusive relationships, and argued there should be a place for those topics in music. ""I've been honest about the challenging relationships I've had,"" she said. ""That's just how it is for many women."" ""I think it's pathetic that my minor lyrical exploration detailing my sometimes submissive or passive roles in my relationships has often made people say I've set women back hundreds of years. ""There has to be a place in feminism for women who look and act like me,"" she continued. ""The kind of woman who says no but men hear yes; the kind of women who are slated mercilessly for being their authentic, delicate selves; the kind of women who get their own stories and voices taken away from them by stronger women or by men who hate women."" Del Rey also called out double standards, noting that stars like Ariana Grande, Cardi B and Beyonce could sing about ""being sexy, wearing no clothes [and] cheating"" without facing criticism. Del Rey's lyrics have frequently addressed unhealthy relationships, and being seduced by controlling or foreboding characters. Her break-out hit and signature song, Video Games, described a lover who was distant and dismissive, but for whom she professed undying love. 'Romanticising domestic abuse' Later songs followed a similar theme. ""My old man is a bad man,"" she sang on Off To The Races; while her boyfriend on Ultraviolence ""used to call me DN - that stood for deadly nightshade, because I was filled with poison"". In recent years, the singer has distanced herself from some of her earlier lyrics, and even removed a song called Cola from her live show because of its references to a Harvey Weinstein-like figure. Speaking to Pitchfork in 2017, she recoiled at the mention of the line ""he hit me and it felt like a kiss"", also from the track Ultraviolence. ""I don't like it. I don't sing that line any more,"" she said. ""Having someone be aggressive in a relationship was the only relationship I knew. I'm not going to say that that [lyric] was 100% true, but I do feel comfortable saying what I was used to was a difficult, tumultuous relationship, and it wasn't because of me. It didn't come from my end."" Nonetheless, accusations of glamorising abuse have continued to haunt the singer. A typical criticism came from journalist Isbella Castillo, who wrote an essay saying Del Rey's music was ""full of outdated, anti-feminist ideas"". ""Whether it was her intention or not, romanticising domestic abuse is dangerous territory when you have an audience of young, impressionable listeners, or any listeners at all for that matter,"" she wrote. Others took a more sympathetic view - with music critic Lindsay Zoladz arguing Del Rey's portrayal of a woman who stumbled, fell and picked herself up again was a more realistic alternative to ""empowerment as the default aspiration of the pop star"". In her Instagram essay, Del Rey picked up this theme, insisting she was writing ""about the realities of what we are all now seeing are very prevalent emotionally abusive relationships all over the world"". She added that her success had given other women the freedom not to sing about being happy,"" and to just be able to say whatever the hell they wanted to in their music - unlike my experience where, if I even expressed a note of sadness in my first two records, I was deemed literally hysterical as though it was literally the 1920s"". Closing her statement, the star said she'd be exploring these themes further in two forthcoming books of poetry; and announced a new album, due on 5 September. That record will be the follow-up to 2019's Norman [Expletive] Rockwell, which was nominated for album of the year at the Grammys, and topped the BBC's ""poll of polls"" for the best-reviewed record of 2019.

"It has had its share of talking points - here are some of the controversies, catwalk looks and revealing outfits that attracted attention in the French capital. Stella McCartney's George Michael tribute Stella McCartney paid tribute to George Michael during the unveiling of her autumn/winter collection. Her show saw a group of models walk out to a remixed version of Faith, complete with a dance routine at the end. Many of the audience members got up to dance, including the designer's sister Mary McCartney. Anti-fur protests Three women wearing animal masks staged a protest by the Eiffel Tower to protest against some designers' use of fur. They held placards which translate as ""I am not leather"", ""I am not wool"" and ""I am not fur"" during the demonstration, organised by animal rights group Peta. Balenciaga's models controversy Balenciaga hit the headlines last week after they fired their casting agency over accusations of malpractice. The agency was accused of mistreating 150 models who were left waiting on a staircase for three hours with no access to food or a bathroom. James Scully, a prominent casting director, drew attention to the issue after alleging on social media that models had been subjected to ""sadistic and cruel"" treatment at the hands of the agency. The fashion house tried to put the spotlight back on the clothes on Sunday with wrap-around skirts inspired by rubber car mats.

Nicki Minaj sat in the front row of the Haider Ackermann show, sandwiched between Caroline de Maigret and Lou Doillon.

"By Ian YoungsEntertainment reporter, BBC News Many fans spent hours trying to access ticket websites and phone lines, which buckled under ""unprecedented"" demand. SJM Concerts managing director Simon Moran said a record one million tickets were sold in one day. ""We coped with it in the best way possible,"" he said. Ticket agency Ticketmaster also said sorry for the ""frustrating delays"". Robbie Williams will rejoin his bandmates on the road for the first time in 16 years when they play at least 25 stadium shows in the UK and Ireland next summer. In a statement, the band said they were ""speechless"" and ""truly and utterly shocked"" at the speed of the sales. ""To sell one million tickets in a day is mind blowing and we think we'll be in shock for a few days,"" they said. ""We want to thank everyone who has bought tickets today and look forward to seeing them next year."" More fans will watch the Progress Live tour than any other tour in UK and Irish history - beating the group's previous record set in 2009. Mr Moran, who is responsible for staging the shows, told BBC News that the technical problems were ""unfortunate"". ""But it's due to the absolutely unprecedented and never-before- seen demand for these tickets to watch Take That,"" he said. ""We're over 950,000 tickets sold which is far in excess of [what] anyone's ever done in one day. So it's a case of coping with it as best we're able to."" Although the official ticket agencies regularly updated their ticketing systems, they ""didn't work today"", he admitted. ""We did our best to ensure we used all of the major ticketing platforms,"" he said. ""They're the market leaders. It's unfortunate but we have sold 950,000 tickets so people have bought them over the course of time."" The website for Ticketmaster, one of the ticket agencies selected, received 20 million page views on Friday. That was ""far in excess"" of the number seen when tickets for Michael Jackson's planned comeback concerts at the O2 arena in London went on sale last spring, the company said. Ticket agents ""struggled to cope with the sheer volume of people"", Ticketmaster admitted. ""We had planned for the demand for Take That tickets to potentially exceed anything we'd ever experienced before at Ticketmaster, and believed that we would be able to respond,"" a statement said. ""But we have undoubtedly seen an unparalleled level of demand today and whilst hundreds and thousands of tickets have been sold, we know that many of our consumers have experienced frustrating delays in securing their tickets. ""We apologise for these problems and acknowledge that this is far from the experience we usually deliver."" The band's tour will include seven nights at the City of Manchester Stadium and a further seven at Wembley Stadium. They will also stop in Sunderland, Cardiff, Glasgow, Dublin and Birmingham. Many dates are now sold out. Thousands of people also queued at venue box offices, while BT said the national phone network received between three and four times the normal number of calls on Friday morning. Meanwhile, hundreds of tickets appeared on eBay and other secondary websites at inflated prices. Police have warned fans not to buy from unofficial agencies, which they said may not fulfil orders and may use personal details in identity theft.

"Sachs, who had been suffering from dementia for four years, died on 23 November and was buried on Thursday. On his role of Manuel, he told the BBC in 2014: ""It was just a part I was playing and people seemed to laugh."" Fawlty Towers star John Cleese called Sachs ""a delight"", while show co-writer Connie Booth said Manuel was ""iconic"". The BBC changed its schedule on Friday to broadcast the Fawlty Towers episode Communication Problems, featuring Manuel's famous ""I know nothing"" line. Manuel was one of the most imitated comedy characters of the 1970s. The waiter, who famously hailed from Barcelona, often said little more than the word ""Que?"" to generate laughs, but arguably his most famous line was ""I know nothing"". The waiter was regularly shown being hit by Cleese's hotel manager character, Basil Fawlty. ""I never got upset when he hit me,"" Sachs said in 2014. ""He's my friend, I must say yes, yes [it hurt], several times, more than once."" Cleese, 77, who was also the co-creator of Fawlty Towers, paid tribute to Sachs in an interview with the BBC. He described his co-star as ""a very nice, sweet man and just a brilliant farceur"". Cleese added: ""He was just a delight, and if you met him, you'd never for a moment think he was a comedian. ""You'd think he was a bank manager, possibly retired. But then you stuck that moustache on him and he turned into a completely different human being."" Fawlty Towers co-writer Booth, who played hotel maid Polly Sherman in the series, said Sachs ""spoke to the world with his body as well as his mangled English."" She said he was a ""universally beloved figure"", saying it was ""a privilege and an education to work with him"". Writing in the Guardian, she also compared the pairing of Cleese and Sachs to that of Abbott and Costello or Laurel and Hardy. She wrote: ""People say that nobody but John could have played Basil; it's just as true that nobody but Andrew could have played Manuel."" Booth added: ""The character became iconic."" 'Sachsgate' Sachs, who was born in Berlin in 1930 but fled Germany for London in 1938, had dozens of other acting roles, both serious and comic - including stints in TV's two biggest soaps. In 2009, he played the role of Ramsey Clegg, half-brother of Norris Cole, in ITV's Coronation Street and in 2015 he briefly joined the BBC's EastEnders as Cyril Bishop. He inadvertently became the subject of headlines in 2008 when he received a series of lewd answerphone messages from Russell Brand and fellow BBC Radio 2 presenter Jonathan Ross during a radio show, which related to Sachs's granddaughter. The so-called Sachsgate affair resulted in Brand and the controller of Radio 2 resigning. Ross was suspended from broadcasting for three months and a review was held into the way BBC output was vetted. Sachs's friend, Blackadder actor Tony Robinson, told BBC Radio 5 Live that Sachs had been ""very modest"" and said that ""it really came as a surprise to him that he had the success that he did"". ""People know him for that one comedy performance, but he was actually a magnificently talented man in a number of fields,"" he said, adding that Sachs had been ""a very fine photographer"" and ""a very accomplished playwright"". He said: ""He's worked in radio for very many years and in a way, given how shy and retiring he was, it was a good form for him. ""His face wasn't shown, he could work a lot but he didn't have to be a celebrity - and then suddenly he was thrown into the limelight."" Comedian Omid Djalili tweeted: ""Sad to learn of the passing of Andrew Sachs. Fond memories sharing a dressing room with him & Bill Bailey at We Are Most Amused in 2008."" Samuel West, whose mother Prunella Scales starred alongside Sachs in Fawlty Towers, tweeted: ""Creator of one of our most beloved EU migrants.

"The first series of the Netflix drama told the story of Hannah Baker, a teenager who took her own life, leaving behind a box of cassette tapes explaining why. It was praised by some for raising awareness of issues including rape, bullying and self-harm, but there were also concerns that it glamorised suicide and went into too much detail about how Hannah killed herself. In the second series, a civil lawsuit is filed against the school for failing to protect Hannah. ""There's a lot of dragging through the same stuff all over again,"" said The Guardian. ""But this time without the framework of the tapes and the reasons. ""It's like being locked in a room with a bunch of self-obsessed teens, occasionally saying things like 'the truth can free you if you let it'. ""As drama, this is pointless, cumbersome, baggy, badly written, ponderous and boring."" Before the season premiere, Netflix was criticised for launching it at the time many of its young viewers would be studying for exams. Helen Rayner of the Royal College of Psychiatrists told The Guardian: ""It's well known within children's services that there's an increase in completed suicides and suicide attempts during the exam season. This could cause an increase in suicide rates."" A warning has been added in which cast members tell viewers the show ""may not be right"" for those struggling with issues such as sexual assault, suicide or substance abuse. In its one-star review, USA Today said: ""We don't need 13 more reasons. ""The second season of Netflix's 13 Reasons Why is a tawdry, unnecessary exercise, a blatant grab for the headlines the teen suicide drama garnered last year. ""The new season tries to make a point about rape culture, slut shaming and sexual harassment, but its depiction of these complex topics has all the subtlety of a sledge hammer. ""If it's meant to start a conversation, as the creators insisted that the first season was, it certainly isn't going to be a very nuanced one."" You may also be interested in: NME said: ""For all that season two gets right, there are as many things it gets wrong."" But, it added: ""Ultimately, season two does enough to justify its existence and you'll likely binge-watch it faster than the first. ""Those who say it's run its course are missing the point. 13 Reasons Why was never about one girl's suicide. It's about endemic problems with society and shining a light on the [issues] young people have to deal with on a daily basis."" Entertainment Weekly also found some positives. ""Though 13 Reasons Why can sometimes be as exasperating and melodramatic as teenagers themselves, the second season nets out as a success,"" its critic said. ""It finishes season two as a show you don't so much enjoy as endure and appreciate later - much like adolescence itself."" Deadline said: ""With the exception of a solid performance again by the talented Dylan Minnette, the Brian Yorkey-showrun adaptation has run out of gas and source material. ""The return of the young adult drama based on Jay Asher's bestselling 2007 novel is really only justified in Netflix's desire to bulk up inventory and attract and maintain subscribers."" The Hollywood Reporter said: ""The second season of Netflix's teen suicide drama is a frustratingly unnecessary mess of bad courtroom antics, stale mysteries and clumsy efforts to bring back Katherine Langford. ""Unfortunately, the season's execution is frequently dismal. And although I didn't feel that the first season engaged in sadness porn or exploitation, I can't say the same for the second. It wallows, especially in later episodes."" But IndieWire defended the show. ""13 Reasons Why features no shortage of missteps. But it's a show that so deeply feels for its characters, so deeply feels these scenarios, that it's hard to be mad at it. ""At its core, it's a show about young people on the cusp of discovering everything good that the world has to offer them, more often than not are slapped down by life's toughest realities.

"The Department of Justice has sued Mr Lowe and his wife Lauren, alleging ""recurring inhumane treatment and improper handling"" of tigers and lions. Mr Lowe hasn't commented but has previously accused the government of making ""false accusations"" against him. He took over the Oklahoma zoo from his ex-business partner Joe Exotic in 2016. Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park, which housed more than 230 tigers and lions, has been targeted in a series of inspections by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Mr Lowe has said the agency had bowed to pressure from animal rights charity Peta, and that his park had become a target for ""every nutjob and animal rights loon in the world"". On Thursday, the Department of Justice (DoJ) said it had filed a civil lawsuit against Mr and Mrs Lowe, accusing them of ""illegally taking, possessing, and transporting protected animals"" including a grizzly bear and ring-tailed lemurs as well as tigers and lions, and ""placing the health of animals in serious danger"". In a statement, principal deputy assistant attorney general Jonathan D Brightbill said the couple had failed to provide ""basic veterinary care, appropriate food, and safe living conditions for the animals"". The lack of adequate care resulted in untimely death ""in some cases"", the DoJ said. ""Animals were not provided with sufficient quantities of appropriate food and were underweight and suffering from nutritional deficiencies, making them susceptible to fractures, unable to stand or walk, and exhibiting neurological problems,"" they added. ""Inspectors also found foul-smelling, partially burned and decomposing big cat carcasses and a broken-down refrigerator truck containing rotting meat."" In June, a court ordered Mr Lowe to vacate the zoo and hand the premises to Carole Baskin, who Joe Exotic was convicted of trying to have killed. Mr Lowe shut the park in August and has since moved 160 big cats to a new zoo in Thackerville, 60 miles south. ""The Lowes have made public statements that the new Thackerville facility will be named 'Tiger King Park' and will operate as a film set for television shows and other video content,"" the DoJ said. The DoJ said it would seek unspecified damages from the Lowes and attempt to seize ""certain animals"" from them. Exotic, real name Joseph Maldonado-Passage, is currently serving a 22-year sentence for his involvement in the murder-for-hire plot and animal abuse. Netflix has reportedly secured the rights to a second season of Tiger King - but the show's popularity means there are already a number of spin-offs on the way, including an eight-part series starring Nicolas Cage as Exotic.

""Cynicism has become the default position for so much of daily structure and daily intercourse,"" Hanks told reporters. ""Why? Because it's easy, and there's good money to be made."" He added: ""Cynicism is a great product to sell, and it's the perfect beginning of any examination of anything. And part of that is conspiracy theories and what have you. ""But I think when Fred Rogers first saw children's programming, he saw something that was cynical, and why would you put something that is cynical in front of a two or three-year-old kid? That you are not cool because you don't have this toy? That it's funny to see someone being bopped on the head? ""That's a cynical treatment of the audience, and we have become so inured to that, that when we are met with as simple a message as 'Hey you know what, it's a beautiful day in the neighbourhood!' we get slapped a little bit. We are allowed, I think, to feel good. There's a place for cynicism, but why begin with it right off the bat?"" A Beautiful Day In The Neighbourhood serves as the title of the Rogers film, which is directed by Marielle Heller - well known for the Oscar-nominated Can You Ever Forgive Me? Heller has explained that, because Mr Rogers (as he was known) had such little conflict in his life, he was not an obvious protagonist for a movie, and his career alone wouldn't have served as a strong enough storyline. Instead, A Beautiful Day In The Neighbourhood follows the relationship between Mr Rogers and a journalist for Esquire magazine, who wrote a profile of the entertainer in 1998. The journalist who wrote the original piece, Tom Junod, possessed by trade just the kind of cynical personality Hanks refers to. But when he met Mr Rogers, he found a more complex character than he was expecting. Over a series of sittings, he and Mr Rogers developed a friendship. The entertainer won Junod over with his seemingly unrelenting kindness and empathy, helping him examine his own issues and find a deeper appreciation for life. lt is, frankly, an outstanding film - one of the best seen so far at the Toronto Film Festival and undoubtedly an awards season contender. ""Marielle Heller excels at pulling heartstrings from sturdy foundations, injecting smart and insightful details into material that could easily default to sentimentality,"" wrote Eric Kohn in IndieWire. ""Hanks isn't just good - he's transporting,"" added Variety's Owen Gleiberman. ""He takes on Mr Rogers' legendary mannerisms and owns them, using them as a conduit to Rogers' disarming inner spirit. He makes you believe in this too-nice-for-words man... [the film] is a soft-hearted fable that works on you in an enchanting way."" The Hollywood Reporter was more sceptical: ""It is a sympathetic and yet entirely predictable in its dramatic trajectory of making a believer of an angry, cynical journalist. Still, the lure of the Hanks/Rogers match-up looks to stir some reasonable commercial returns."" More from Toronto: The script for A Beautiful Day in the Neighbourhood had been floating around Hollywood for some time before production began. Hanks even passed on the role several times - but then ended up saying yes once director Marielle Heller became attached to the project. The pair had been looking to work on a film together for some time and Hanks said he felt she was the right person to deliver it to the screen. Matthew Rhys, who plays the journalist, said the film taps into a vulnerability which men in particular often keep hidden under the surface. ""Marielle talked about giving men in general a greater emotional vocabulary, or working towards articulating their emotions, and not just generally men, I think society in general would benefit from it,"" he said. ""And I think it was instantly relatable that someone was so desperately wanting to be seen, but hiding behind this castle that he built for himself, and I think it's a message of hope."" Mr Rogers, who died in 2003, isn't well known in many international territories, however, in the same way he is in the US. Therefore, while a Tom Hanks movie can generally be expected to draw the public to the cinema, the distributors may have a struggle on their hands to market it in some international territories. But by the time it reaches UK cinemas, the awards season buzz it is generating may well be enough to carry it to significant box office success.",Tom Hanks has said the increasing level of cynicism in society is partly what led him to take a role as a loveable children's entertainer.

He told the Radio Times he hoped to raise the 12-minute programme above its current ""two dimensional nothingness"". Evans added that he hoped the live game show would be the beginning of more prominent roles on weekend TV screens. He described the current National Lottery programme as ""barely a show"". Evans fronted hit shows TFI Friday and Don't Forget Your Toothbrush for Channel 4 in the 1990s, The 47-year-old currently hosts a weekday BBC Radio 2 breakfast show as well as BBC One's Friday evening edition of The One Show. 'Safe hands' Evans also presented The Big Breakfast and the BBC Radio 1 breakfast show in the 1990s, before moving to Virgin Radio and later buying the station. The 47-year-old presenter, who has attracted 9.75 million listeners as Terry Wogan's early-morning successor on Radio 2, said he could now be regarded as ""a veteran consummate broadcaster"". ""The thing is, when you're young, you're allowed to mess up. You are allowed to start lots of things and not necessarily finish them,"" Evans told the magazine. ""You can leave a wake of success, mediocrity and destruction. And you can sort of, professionally, get away with it. It's a rite of passage.

"Cleese, who co-starred with Brooke-Taylor in the 1960s and 70s, said he was ""a great performer and companion"". Fry described him as ""a hero for as long as I can remember"", while Mitchell said ""the world has been robbed"". The former member of 1970s trio The Goodies died on Sunday after contracting coronavirus. Cleese, who met the comedian at Cambridge University and went on to appear with him on stage and screen, said the news meant he had ""just lost the will to be silly"". Fry added that Brooke-Taylor was ""gentle, kind, funny, wise, warm, but piercingly witty when he chose to be"". Mitchell, who appeared alongside Brooke-Taylor on BBC Radio 4's panel show I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue, described him as ""a wonderful comedian and a really lovely man"". The surviving members of The Goodies mourned their co-star. Bill Oddie remembered him as ""a true visual comic and a great friend"", while Graeme Garden said he was ""terribly saddened by the loss of a dear colleague and close friend of over 50 years"". The madcap sketch show began in 1970 and ran for 12 years, bringing the trio prime-time TV success. Brooke-Taylor had previously starred with Garden, Oddie and Cleese, among others, on BBC radio comedy I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again in the 1960s. That later led to Radio 4's long-running I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue. Brooke-Taylor appeared on the first edition in 1972 and remained a regular guest. The show's host Jack Dee said Brooke-Taylor was ""a delightful man and never anything but great company"". He said: ""Tim brought a unique quality to Clue. He was a proper team player, very generous as a performer, never egotistical and always more than delighted to set himself up as the butt of the joke. ""For me, his great comedy gift was playing the injured innocent and he did it with brilliance and a characteristic lightness of touch. ""It's always heartbreaking to lose a loved one, but these times have created the cruellest of circumstances for that to happen in and my thoughts are with his wife Christine and all his family.""

"The broadcaster was speaking to BBC Radio 2's Chris Evans in his first interview since losing his job over a ""fracas"" with a producer. He said leaving the show had ""left a huge hole"" in his life ""that needs to be filled"". Clarkson admitted he had taken phone calls from broadcasters who wanted to poach the Top Gear team but said: ""I'd be a fool to jump into something."" ""I have been at the BBC for 27 years. When you emerge after 27 years, you find the world is changed. ""When you learn how the world works, you can start to work out what to do,"" he continued. ""In the meantime I'm getting really good at tennis. My forehand has improved immeasurably."" Later on Thursday, Clarkson will launch what he called a ""badly organised world tour"" with his former co-hosts Richard Hammond and James May in Belfast. He said the production was Top Gear in all but name - but the team were now ""able to make their own films"" for the big screens ""without any meddling"" from the BBC. ""It's broadly the same thing it's been for the last 10 years,"" he added. Petition Clarkson was suspended, then dropped, by the BBC in March following a ""fracas"" with a producer at a hotel. Producer Oisin Tymon suffered swelling and a split lip in the assault by Clarkson on 4 March and visited a hospital A&E department for his injuries. Following an internal investigation, the BBC announced on 25 March Clarkson's contract on Top Gear would not be renewed. At the time, a BBC spokesman said: ""Jeremy's contract has not been renewed on Top Gear but he isn't banned from appearing on the BBC."" More than a million fans signed a petition to reinstate the presenter, but BBC director general Tony Hall said ""a line has been crossed"" and ""there cannot be one rule for one and one rule for another"". 'Very sad' Top Gear is watched by some 350 million viewers worldwide and is one of the BBC's biggest properties, with overseas sales worth an estimated £50m a year. Speaking to Chris Evans, Clarkson said the show was ""very much my baby, I absolutely adored it. I worked all through the night and paid attention to every tiny bit. ""And then suddenly you are not asked to do that any more... I was very sad."" But the presenter said he did not harbour any resentment towards the BBC. ""There are some dreadful people in it,"" he said, ""but there are also some really talented, brilliant people. I will never complain about it."" The BBC plans to relaunch Top Gear with new presenters. Evans, a noted car enthusiast, had been linked to the reboot but has ruled himself out.","Jeremy Clarkson has said being dropped from Top Gear ""was my own silly fault""."
"General Manager Peter Gelb was speaking to BBC Radio 3's Music Matters programme about the Met's current funding issues. He proposed cutting 16% of its $200m (£119m) labour costs by changing work rules for the orchestra and chorus. Gelb also defended spending $169,000 (£100,000) on a poppy field stage set for the opera Prince Igor. Unions have already threatened strike action over the proposed pay cuts, which are up for debate before the players' current contracts expire at the end of July. ""What's at stake, ultimately, is the future of the Met Opera,"" Gelb told Music Matters' presenter, Tom Service. ""I'm just trying to address this problem a few steps before the edge of the precipice instead of waiting until we are actually on the precipice."" He continued: ""Even if I was the worst manager in the world, if two thirds of the cost structure is going to the unions, clearly that's an area that has to be cut."" He hopes to change rules that currently guarantee members of the orchestra and chorus get paid for at least four performances a week, when they usually perform less. Expensive productions Answering criticism that the company's productions cost too much, Gelb said they had saved ""enormous amounts of money"" through co-productions. When probed on the issue of the expensive poppy field he replied: ""Well it's a very large poppy field, and in fact it was the entire scene. ""A hundred and sixty-nine thousand dollars for an entire scene of an opera is not a lot of money. It was the main visual component of the piece and, in fact, Prince Igor was acclaimed by critics as perhaps the greatest production of the Met season."" Gelb added: ""Putting on productions is expensive. What we have to do it make it less expensive - not by going back to the stone ages of opera theatre and having productions that no-one will want to see, but by cutting down on the labour costs."" Gelb said the Met's shrinking audience was partly to blame for the shortfall in funding. ""The box office has not increased, it's been flat which represents a shrinking playing field for opera - it's not a secret in the US that the frequency of opera going is going down. ""The Met Opera house has 3,800 seats, far larger than any European opera house,"" continued Gelb. ""We are getting a newer audience, a younger audience, but there aren't enough new audience members to replace the old audience members who are dying off."" Lack of education Gelb said he no longer thought the company's live cinema broadcasts were encouraging people to stay away from real opera houses - and cited studies which showed local screenings were allowing older opera fans not to miss out. ""At a cinema in America showing opera, 75% of them [the audience] are over 65, and 30% of them are over 75. ""Those are people who are so old they can't make it to the Met any more, so instead they're getting a chance to extend their opera going in these cinemas."" He said the HD broadcasts had been a huge hit globally, with Germany the opera house's second biggest audience, with 30-35,000 tickets sold for one Saturday performance alone. However, Gelb lamented the lack of opera and arts education in schools in the US and elsewhere. ""Children are brought up to be tech wizards and to have the attention spans of mice. How do you educate new audiences to like opera which takes three or four hours and is in foreign languages? ""We're trying. As long as governments are not interested in arts education, I think we are in a Catch-22 situation. ""How can we possibly hope to create new audiences for this art form if we are not introducing them or educating them?""

"The bombshell comes from a new court filing in an increasingly bitter battle between the actor and his ex-managers. He's suing them for mismanaging his money and they're countersuing him. Among their claims about his spending, they say he paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to employ a sound engineer to read him his lines on film sets. The actor has used the method ""for years to feed him lines during film production"", according to a court document that was filed on Monday. ""Depp insisted that this sound engineer be kept on yearly retainer so that he no longer had to memorise his lines,"" according to the papers, written by attorney Michael Kump on behalf of The Management Group's Joel and Robert Mandel. Details of the court document have been reported by The Hollywood Reporter, Variety, Deadline, the New York Post and others. A lawyer for the movie star responded by describing the allegations as ""psychobabble"". A statement from Adam Waldman said: ""This is how guilty people respond when confronted with the detailed results of a nine-month legal and forensic investigation conducted by four firms."" In the new document, The Management Group (TMG) said the Pirates of the Caribbean star may have ""compulsive spending disorder"" and needs ""a mental examination"". He originally sued them for fraud, but in an amended complaint filed on Monday, the firm said they ""did everything possible to protect Depp from his own irresponsible and profligate spending"" before he fired them in March 2016. 'Hush money' According to the reports, they claim he spent more than $75m (£58m) to acquire and improve on 14 residences, including a chain of islands in the Bahamas, multiple houses in Hollywood and a 45-acre chateau in the south of France. They also say he bought 45 luxury vehicles, 70 collectible guitars and enough Hollywood memorabilia to fill 12 storage facilities. Depp spent up to $1.2m (£930,000) a year for a ""personal on-call physician"" and ""millions more to employ an army of attorneys"", they allege. They say the lawyers bailed him out of legal crises and made a series of ""hush money settlements"" - details of which will be revealed if there is a trial. And they dismissed as ""laughable"" a claim by a lawyer for Depp that he spent $30,000 (£23,300) a month on wine as an ""investment"". ""Depp would be hard pressed to find a single bottle of wine that he purchased during his tenure with TMG that he or his various companions have not yet consumed,"" they said.

Ticketing website See Tickets had earlier apologised to customers on Twitter for ""technical difficulties"". The site, which had been managing the sale of tickets for Glastonbury, wrote that the issues had led to ""a very difficult half an hour"" before the site stabilised, later adding that it was selling 3,000 tickets a minute. Prices for the 2014 event had been increased by £10 to £210, plus a booking fee, but festival-goers could pay a deposit of £50 before settling their bill in April. For the first time, coach packages were available three days earlier, with all 15,000 tickets selling out in half an hour. A statement by the father and daughter Eavis team, Michael and Emily, was posted on the festival's own Twitter feed, saying: ""We genuinely try to make the ticket system as fair as it can be, but when demand outstrips supply, it is an unfortunate inevitability that some people will be left disappointed.""

"The Sunday Times reported American writers will be eligible to enter for the first time from 2014. At present the literary prize only considers works by writers from the Commonwealth, Ireland or Zimbabwe. Booker organisers said ""some changes to the rules"" would be announced on Wednesday. ""The information which is currently in circulation is incomplete,"" said a spokesperson on Monday. According to The Sunday Times report, ""the organisers increasingly believe that excluding writers from America is anachronistic. The Booker committee believes US writers must be allowed to compete to ensure the award's global reputation"". The writer and broadcaster Lord Bragg was quoted as saying he was ""disappointed... though not that surprised. The Booker will now lose its distinctiveness. It's rather like a British company being taken over by some worldwide conglomerate"". Howard Jacobson, who won the prize with The Finkler Question in 2010 told The Telegraph it was the ""wrong decision"" but declined to expand on his comments. Of the six authors announced last week on this year's Man Booker shortlist, four live and work in the United States. Jim Crace, nominated this year for Harvest, told The Independent: ""If you open the Booker prize to all people writing in the English language it would be a fantastic overview of English language literature but it would lose a focus. ""I'm very fond of the sense of the Commonwealth. There's something in there that you would lose if you open it up to American authors."" But Kazuo Ishiguro, who won the Booker in 1989 for Remains of the Day, told The Independent he was in favour of the move. ""It's sad in a way because of the traditions of the Booker, and I can understand some people feeling a bit miffed, but the world has changed and it no longer makes sense to split up the writing world in this way."" Next March the newly-created Folio Prize will hand out its first accolade. The £40,000 prize will be awarded to a work of fiction written in the English language published in the UK - including American authors. The Folio Prize was first announced in 2011 amidst a row in literary circles about the decision by Booker judges that year to focus on ""readability"", but organisers have denied it is a rival to the Booker. It is backed by a 100-strong academy of authors and critics which includes Margaret Atwood and Philip Pullman. Speaking to The Bookseller last week, Booker Prize director Ion Trewin said the organisers had discussed changing its entry requirements in the past year, but would stick with the existing rules ""for the moment"". He said: ""The problem of non-simultaneous publication between the UK and US is one of the reasons why [we limit geographic submissions], because we are a contemporary prize making the award in the year the books are published. Admitting any writer who writes in English isn't easy while - even with e-books - still there is often a gap between the US and UK. It's the reason we haven't taken that step.""

""We would like to thank BP for their generous support of the RSC since 2011,"" they said. In a statement, BP said it was ""disappointed and dismayed"" its partnership had been brought to a ""premature"" end. ""Over the past eight years our sponsorship has enabled 80,000 young people to see RSC performances at reduced rates,"" it continued. The company said it shared ""many of the concerns that apparently contributed to the decision"" and was committed to making energy ""cleaner and better"". ""The increasing polarisation of debate, and attempts to exclude companies committed to making real progress, is exactly what is not needed,"" it continued. Last week, a group of students said they would boycott RSC productions if it continued to accept funding from a company they accused of ""actively destroying our futures"". ""BP's influence is nothing but a stain on the RSC,"" they wrote in a letter. Earlier this year, Sir Mark Rylance, a long-standing critic of the sponsorship agreement, resigned from his post as an RSC associate artist. In his resignation letter, the Oscar-winning actor said he did not ""wish to be associated with BP any more than I would with an arms dealer [or] tobacco salesman"". Greenpeace UK said it was ""time other oil-sponsored institutions took note"".

"The country's film censorship board said Hustlers' naked breasts, erotic dances and scenes featuring drugs made it ""not suitable for public screening"". Square Box Pictures, the company distributing Hustlers in Malaysia, confirmed the ban on social media. The film is currently riding high in both the US and UK box office charts. In Hustlers, a group of exotic dancers set out to fleece their wealthy clients. The film, which also stars Constance Wu and Julia Stiles alongside Lizzo and Cardi B in smaller roles, is based on a true story and was inspired by a New York Magazine article that went viral in 2015. The BBFC (British Board of Film Classification) gave the film a 15 certificate due to its ""sexualised nudity, strong sex references, language [and] drug misuse"". Earlier this year gay sex scenes in Rocketman were censored in Malaysia ahead of the Elton John biopic's release there.

"By Mark SavageBBC Music reporter As a member of the US girl group Fifth Harmony, she'd sold millions of records and scored global hits with the slinky R&B of Worth It and Work From Home. But the band were burned out, forced into a punishing work schedule and recording songs they didn't believe in. ""It's overwhelming to have your whole, entire life planned for something you don't feel passionate about,"" Jauregui told the LA Times in 2017. ""You're not seeing your family, your friends. You're not doing anything for yourself. It was depressing, draining and sad."" Camila Cabello was the first to quit, allegedly on bad terms. The rest of the band struggled through one last album before announcing an ""indefinite hiatus"" last March. All five members have since released solo material, with Jauregui's fierce-yet-vulnerable Expectations among the best of the bunch; showcasing the 22-year-old's husky voice against a simple guitar riff. But she only managed to record it after a confusing and painful period in the musical wilderness. ""The industry clouds your soul,"" Jauregui tells the BBC. ""They make you feel like you have to be a certain way to be accepted, and I got lost in that. ""I had been pushed a psyche [mindset] of what successful music sounded like - so I had this backwards concept of what I thought was good for me, commercially."" The situation became so bad that the musician stopped writing, and even listening to, music. ""Then, as soon as the group dissolved and we started to go our separate ways, it cleared a lot of blockages from my heart,"" she says. ""I started getting back into music that I actually liked."" She delved into the albums that inspired her as a teenager - The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, Amy Winehouse's Back To Black, Songs In A Minor by Alicia Keys - and began to figure out her own sound. ""Last year was super-challenging in the sense of ripping away all the things that weren't me any more and allowing myself to come through that. ""I was like, 'Do you know what? I have to pull back. I like more organic sounding things, I like live instruments, I like writing lyrics that come straight from the heart.'"" One of the first songs she wrote in that frame of mind was Expectations, which quickly established itself as the perfect debut single. ""I went on tour with Halsey - and that was one of the songs I had in my setlist. When I sang it for the first time in Sao Paolo, it was completely unreleased [but] by the end of the song they were singing the words back to me. ""English isn't their first language in Brazil, so I was floored by the response. That's why I chose it."" Mighty Aphrodite Jauregui started 2019 by following Expectations up with More Than That - a sassy, assertive takedown of a wannabe lover. ""You gon' have to come stronger than this liquor/ Wanna take me home, better be more convincing / It'll take more than that to get to me,"" she sings over a slick trap beat. Hammering home her messages of feminine power and self-worth, Jauregui recreates Botticelli's iconic 15th Century painting The Birth of Venus in the artwork. The video, meanwhile, sees her playing Aphrodite, who comes to earth and visits a strip club (stick with us here) in a celebration of womanhood. ""It's about taking that kind of rap video imagery and empowering the women who do this work,"" she explains. ""They're stripping, but each woman's spirit is captured in a way that's revering her strength and her sensuality."" Having dreamt up the video concept and cast the models, Jauregui found herself in awe of their athleticism. ""It was amazing. The number of hours they were doing these tricks and twirling and carving the pole. You'd think they'd be all oiled up - but they have to be completely dry, with chalk on their hands, so they can do their work. ""I was grateful we could capture that and really highlight them. They're the centrepiece of the video for me."" And did she pick up any tips? ""Any tips?!"" she laughs heartily. ""Well, yeah, just by watching them. The way they used their bodies is so mesmerising."" Fighting 'hate rhetoric' Jauregui, who was born in Miami to Cuban parents, came out as bisexual in a powerful column for Billboard magazine in 2016, which she wrote as an angry response to Donald Trump's election victory. ""If I could tell every Trump supporter two things, it would be to travel and read a history book,"" she wrote. ""Realise that your white skin is the result of immigration from Europe, that the only true 'Americans' are Native Americans. None of us belong here but all of us deserve the right to feel safe and live our lives in peace."" Two years into Trump's presidency, she's still exasperated (""every day something ignorant comes out of his mouth"") but determined to turn her anger into something more positive. ""We're all becoming aware of how atrocious the hate rhetorics are, and how destructive they are to humanity but instead of just trashing what's going on - which I did for a while - I've shifted my focus into a more productive energy, of how can I convince people to get together and uplift each other."" Outside of her music, she's leveraged her 10 million social media followers to campaign for gun reform and LGBT rights; and partnered with Amnesty International's Write For Rights campaign, encouraging people to contact government officials in support of female human rights activists who find themselves in danger. Was she warned against making political statements when she was in Fifth Harmony? ""Of course people advised me against it,"" she says. ""When you're working in any industry that has to do with making people like you, they're going to advise you against saying things that would turn anyone off. ""But I just happen to have a very powerful voice. I articulate myself well when I write and when I speak, so if God gave me that power, I have to use it."" Her beliefs have permeated her music - most notably on Strangers, a tumultuous LGBT duet from Halsey's Hopeless Fountain Kingdom album - but Jauregui says her debut album will be more personal than political. ""That's just who I am. I'm a deeply emotional thinker, so a lot of my music is reflective of coming of age and finding yourself and clearing out the clutter in your heart. ""But I think that's ok. I want to be someone who is about love and acceptance, no matter where you come from, no matter how you look, no matter what your story is.

"By Lucy ToddEntertainment reporter in Lisbon Eurovision proved once more that it embraces the outsider, the person who doesn't fit in. It follows Conchita Wurst's victory in 2014 and, before her, that of Dana International in 1998. Netta told BBC News that she came to realise that she was ""different"" because of her size and found out that ""different is often not accepted"". This is why, as she lifted her winner's trophy, she said: ""Thank you for choosing different."" Netta stood out in this year's competition right from the beginning. In the weeks leading up to the contest all the buzz was about the Israeli entry. But in the past few days, her star seemed to have waned in favour of Cyprus' hair-flicking Eleni Foureira. Certainly among the press, Netta had been almost written off - with Cyprus, France, Ireland and Italy thought to be the more credible acts. By the half-way point in the scoring, though, the national juries had confounded this and she was in a strong third position. And then for the public vote - where the 25-year old gained enough points from viewers at home to move into first and take the Eurovision crown. They had seen someone who was fun and quirky but who also carried a meaningful and substantial message of accepting who you are. Not even close In 2018, Netta's victory feels particularly deserved following the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements. Eleni - all credit to her - was perhaps just too beautiful, too slick and too mainstream. In the end, the vote wasn't even that close: Eleni's 436 points to Netta's 529. Netta said the competition wasn't against Eleni, but was about challenging herself. ""I'll keep competing with myself till I die,"" she said in an interview following her win. Aside from Netta's win, outside the Altice Arena all fans wanted to talk about was the stage invasion during SuRie's performance for the UK. SuRie had her microphone snatched out of her hand as she was mid-song, leaving her unable to perform for 15-20 seconds. In response, Eurovision fans rallied around SuRie, giving her the biggest cheer of the night, and imploring her to carry on. And that she did gamely, finishing her song powerfully, but visibly shaken. She was offered the chance to perform again, but declined. Portuguese colleagues tell me they felt ashamed at that moment, that they had let SuRie down, after months of her preparing for these three minutes on stage. Nothing political Whether or not the event had any effect on the vote is hard to tell. The jury votes are already cast the night before the grand final, so this hitch would not have been taken into account at all. Perhaps the UK gained a few more votes from the televote, but it was still to be 24th place out of 26. Swedish commentator and Eurovision 2016 organiser, Edward af Sillen, told me that it's nothing personal or political against the UK. ""It's all about the song,"" he says. ""This year's entry (Storm) was not the best, but the BBC is moving in the right direction. ""It's never too late,"" he says. ""We are just waiting for you to enter the right song, and when that happens Eurovision will be so happy for you."" One of the major upsets of the night came in the guise of Austria's Cesar Sampson, which the UK jury was the first of many to award 12 points to. There had been no buzz around this act whatsoever. Nobody But You is a nice enough song, and Cesar has a rich, warm voice - but it just didn't seem to stand out among the other entries. And yet. And yet it led at half time, once all the jury votes were in. Sampson himself said he couldn't believe it. Once all was said and done it ended up in third place - an incredible result, although Sampson actually came second last year when he performed as a backing singer for the Bulgarian entrant. I don't think he'll be too upset though. Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

"By Sabrina SweeneyEntertainment reporter, BBC News Having met Scorsese ""by accident"" in 1963, the duo have produced some of the most critically acclaimed films of the past 30 years, including Raging Bull, Goodfellas and The Aviator. Scorsese also introduced her to her late husband, the British film director Michael Powell, whom she was married to for six years until his death in 1990. The BBC caught up with Schoonmaker, 72, to hear about her experience working with one of the greatest filmmakers of the 21st Century, and their side project to restore the classic films of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger to their original Technicolour glory. You obviously bring a mass of technical skill to your job as editor, but working with the same director - one as significant as Scorsese - for more than three decades, presumably you've built up a very personal relationship with him. All great directors or anyone who has a strong vision like Scorsese needs to have a lot of support around them. I think from the very beginning - when we met each other - he realised he could trust me to do what was right for his movies. [Rather than] making a name for myself, I would be hand in glove with him in terms of carrying through what he tries to lay down when he shoots. He says I bring out the humanity in his films. I don't think that's really true - he lays it down there - but I think as a woman, perhaps I'm more tuned in to emotional things in the films that maybe I pull out more. We work as a team and I understand what he is trying to do and what he approves and disapproves of in terms of acting. He has this thing about eyebrows. He thinks [they] are too easy a thing for actors, so he discourages the use of eyebrows too much. That's the kind of depth and it's that kind of thing that - over the years - you learn. Scorsese's work with actors often involves giving them the freedom to improvise and deviate from the script, so does this complicate your job? The film we're filming now is called Wolf of Wall Street and it's filled with improvisation. He's being very brave in the way he's using improvisation and the actors are having a hell of a time coming up with great original humour. He loves working that way; taking this rich ore and mining it and shaping it as they're shooting. Then I have to deal with all the problems that causes because things don't match. But that's not important, what's important is to get the power of the scene across and don't worry about whether things match, or find another way to get around it. It's such fun! What was it about Powell and Pressburger's 1943 film The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp that made you and Scorsese feel it deserved to be brought back to life? We've both seen the movie over and over again and we both feel so deeply about it. It's a very unusual film, you never know what's coming next. It portrays people and the way life buffets them in an extraordinary way. You go through the main character understanding very early in his life that he's lost the woman that he loves because he doesn't realise he loved her until too late. She gives him the signals but he waits too long and another man marries her. That sadness and sense of loss pervades the rest of the film but not in a way that makes you feel bad. It's examining something that many people feel in life all the time. What did Scorsese bring to the project? Scorsese was so deeply influenced as a film maker by [Powell and Pressburger] and the fact they were so unusual and never cliched or sentimental. His commitment is to restore every film that needs it. My husband said the first time he met him he couldn't believe this young director knew every shot [he'd] ever taken and the blood started to run in [his] veins again. They had a wonderful friendship and [Scorsese] brought him back to the world. You were involved with the project to remaster The Red Shoes, Powell and Pressburger's classic 1948 film. What challenges are associated with restoring old films renowned for their mastery in Technicolor cinematography? Some of the film was covered in mould, a common problem that occurs in archive. The mould was actually eating into the emulsion of the film. But the result [of the restoration] is that Blimp has become alive, it's so vivid. That vividness has brought the humour to the fore, a loving examination of bureaucrats and the strange people who made up that world at the time. Instead of just being plainly satirical or savage, it's an understanding portrayal of what these people were like at this time. Despite making influential films through the 1940s and 1950s, Powell and Pressburger were lesser known than their contemporaries such as Alfred Hitchcock. Their films were very unusual, every film was different and my husband said the reason critics didn't support them as well as they should have was because they had to go in and engage with the film, they had to experience something new and when they were writing eight reviews a week, it was a bit annoying. Now, [their films] are considered masterpieces, but at that time people thought they might have been a little too weird, too emotional. The other thing is they never spent any money on self publicising themselves. They were too busy making movies. David Lean and Hitchcock had big Hollywood publicity machines behind them. A special restoration edition of The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp is available now on DVD and Blu-ray.","The name Thelma Schoonmaker may not ring a bell with everyone, but as Martin Scorsese's three-time Oscar winning editor, she is one of the most trusted names in film editing."
"Amol RajanMedia editor@amolrajanon Twitter Comcast's winning £17.28-a-share bid for Sky smashed the £15.67 Disney were prepared to go up to. Why were Comcast prepared to pay so much? Because they are desperate and Sky is too juicy to ignore. Let's take those in reverse order. Sky's remarkable valuation, at £30bn, is the loudest endorsement of a British media company in recent history. As Lex notes, ""the premium Comcast is offering over the Sky market price just before [Fox's offer for the 61% it doesn't own, in December 2016] is an incredible 124%."" Sky has around 27 million subscribers across Europe. Crucially, this means that it is not primarily an ad-funded broadcaster, and has data about its customers' interests. Think of Netflix, the most valuable and fastest growing TV and film company in the world. You don't see adverts on Netflix, and the company doesn't have a daily schedule to fill, with peaks and troughs according to different times of the day. It just buys in or makes programmes and films, and then charges you for it. Charging customers obviously allows you to grow revenues just by growing your base, rather than haggling with advertisers. It also means that by gathering a trail of data about their tastes, and quite possibly where they live and when they generally watch shows, you can target them with stuff you know they'll like. This is the huge advantage that Sky have over ad-funded terrestrial broadcasters. TV advertising is relatively stable just now, but as eyeballs shift online, so too are advertising dollars (often to just two companies, Google and Facebook). Better and safer in the long-term to rely on subscription income - with the mine of rich data that brings. The other, often neglected aspect of the deal is technology. Brian Roberts of Comcast relayed with glee an anecdote about visiting a Sky store in Westfield Shopping Centre in West London, where he saw a demonstration of the Sky Q kit. He was impressed by the user experience, and his gut instinct was to pursue the company. This creates the interesting situation in which an American media company will treat the technology of a British one as an education. Sky has had a strong couple of years, with growing revenue, earnings per share, and EBITDA; a series of major sports rights deals; and significant partnerships with BT Sport, Netflix, and Spotify. It is also creating world-class, slick productions with the world's most sought-after names. Benedict Cumberbatch's performance as Patrick Melrose came at a useful time. And Sky is a media mega-power in a territory, Europe, which various US giants feel exposed in. Comcast is currently America's biggest provider of cable and broadband services. It is unheard of in much of Europe. Buying Sky transforms it from US giant to international giant at a stroke. Provided, that is, they can make it work. Investors are sceptical. Comcast shares fell 8% - the most for three years - on worries that Roberts had overpaid. Has he? We won't know for a while. But back to that gut instinct. The final bid made for Sky, in a dramatic finale to this deal, took place in an environment which was not altogether conducive to sober contemplation. Mr Roberts and his senior team spent Saturday in a 5-star hotel. They were surrounded by bankers from Evercore, Bank of America and Robey Warshaw. It would be interesting to know if these financial wizards, whose advice was so precious to Mr Roberts, dined together on Saturday evening, once they'd won. Such a tense and intense atmosphere can foster over-zealous behaviour. Particularly when you throw in the egos involved. As this analysis in the Murdoch-owned Wall Street Journal makes clear, Roberts and Murdoch have had an at-times fraught relationship. Roberts and Bob Iger of Disney have been arch-rivals for years. And who could forget that in 2004, Comcast made a hostile bid for, yes, Disney - which ended in ignominy. As Simon Duke wrote in the also Murdoch-owned Times, ""For Brian Roberts, landing Sky will be a moment of sweet revenge. The Comcast boss has seen his ambitions thwarted twice before by Disney."" Perhaps pinching Sky from under the mouse's nose was a case of unfinished business. The main driver of the three American bids for Sky (from Comcast, Disney and Fox) was of course the mad scramble for eye-balls in an industry ripped asunder by technology giants such as Netflix and Amazon. Their enormous budgets, and fast-swelling customer bases, are re-shaping the sector. Their rivals need to grab as much land as possible while they can. But the adrenaline-fuelled nature of the final bid, the clashing egos involved, the backstory of Comcast's pursuit of Disney, and above all that share price slide yesterday suggests that for all the immense merits of Sky, it will take a superhuman performance to justify the final price.

"By Sarah Jane GriffithsEntertainment reporter, BBC News Dressed all in black on a rare sweltering summer's day in London, the singer is feeling reassured about the release of her second album, Halcyon, in October. New single Anything Could Happen got what she calls ""a good reaction"" after its first play on Radio 1 - the 25-year-old's name trended worldwide on Twitter. ""I was nervous, understandably, because it's been such a long time here since anyone's heard anything original,"" she explains. Goulding has just jetted in from the US where she's been spending ""a lot"" of time. ""Pretty much on and off for a year and a half,"" she says. ""People think I've moved there!"" It seems her home from home is pretty keen too, with the title track from her 2010 debut Lights currently at number two in the US Billboard chart. ""It's going really well out there. Nobody expected Lights to be anywhere near number one. It's really old, I wrote it way before my first album came out in a hotel in Brighton. It's been on a really crazy journey."" Released as the album's sixth single here, it failed to reach the top 40, peaking at number 49 last March. but it has been rising up the US charts for several months. ""Maybe there's something to do with the lyrics or the melody that has appealed more to an American audience?"" suggests Goulding. ""It didn't do anything here. If I had made it and thought 'this is quite a strong song, it might do well in some commercial capacity'... but I didn't. ""I mean I love it, obviously, I wrote it. You've got to love your own songs otherwise it defeats the object, but I can't explain it."" A support slot on Katy Perry's tour and the 'Royal Wedding effect' - she sang her cover of Elton John's Your Song for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's first dance - have no doubt helped boost her US profile. But now she must focus on her new album. Goulding swapped the Bromley bedroom where she recorded her debut for the English countryside and the home studio of producer Jim Elliot, who has previously worked with Kylie and Ladyhawke. She reckons the more experimental and ""darker record"" is a big risk, but it seems there is no getting away from a certain subject. ""I was determined to make it not about love, because the last one was so much about that,"" she explains. ""But when I did start writing it, I went through a break up and it was really difficult, and so the record ended up being about that. ""I couldn't help it. Every time I went to the studio I ended up writing quite sad songs. But even when I'm in quite a happy state of mind, I like writing really sad songs. I think a lot of people do,"" says Goulding. After splitting from Radio 1 DJ Greg James, she is now dating US dubstep producer Skrillex - a ""good person"" who was himself tipped in this year's Sound of 2012. Clearly he has also had an influence on the record's glitching, electronic sounds (the couple also happen to have cute matching haircuts). ""Yeah, it's something that I can't explain very well,"" admits Goulding. ""But I guess Anything Could Happen is about that, because I didn't know what was around the corner"". Goulding says Anything Could Happen is probably the happiest song she has ever written in her life. ""I think being close to someone who is also a musician, and one I really respect and I'm a big fan of, all it does is motivate me and makes me want to work harder and be better,"" she says. Despite being championed by the BBC and the Brits before even releasing an album, Goulding still feels she has done things ""the hard way"". ""It took time to really build myself a reputation as a good live performer, a musician and an artist,"" she reveals. ""I think around the time I played Glastonbury was a turning point. Then I started getting quite a lot of respect as a musician as opposed to just someone who'd had lots of hype and won things."" Goulding has made no secret of her initial struggles with fame and success, which caused her to suffer panic attacks that felt ""like having a heart attack"". ""It's a really scary, solitary, lonely thing. So I just want other people in that to know they're not alone,"" she says. But Goulding agrees she is not exactly the ""no personal questions"" type of artist. ""I just don't like going, 'I don't want to answer that'. I think I'm just too nice,"" she explains. ""I find it hard not to be honest. I can't imagine making a record and people not knowing the back story. ""Maybe one day I'll make a record that's really mysterious and no one knows where it came from or what I wrote it about. But thus far, I've just wanted to explain everything properly."" With the back story to Halcyon explained, Goulding's now preparing for what her manager tells her will be ""the busiest couple of years of my life"". But unlike last time, she is ready. ""I used to make my manager Jamie not tell me where I was going to be the next day, because I was so afraid of flying and of anything,"" she says. ""But now I love flying, I love working hard, I love being around the world. So much has changed, I think it's going to make a big difference."" However, she is glad to be stationed back in London before touring starts in December. ""Rehearsals are the most important thing in my world at the moment. The live show is going to be bigger, crazier, so we've got a lot of work to do. ""I'm just thinking about it now and suddenly I'm really stressed out!"" It is just as well she has put her old training regime, running and working out for two hours a day, on the back burner. ""It's not as crazy. I used to train a lot, really hard,"" she admits, before an injury forced her to slow down. ""I feel like maybe I went too hard too soon and now I need to chill out a bit? ""But I was on the treadmill watching the Olympics the other night and it couldn't be a bigger motivation for me. I saw Bolt win and just suddenly upped my speed!"" Anything Can Happen is out on 30 September. Halcyon follows on 8 October.","After winning the BBC's Sound of 2010, Ellie Goulding delivered a UK number one album and turned Royal Wedding singer. Now she's back with an ""experimental break-up album"" and an unexpected US chart hit."
"The reboot of the comic book series, which opened last Tuesday, has now taken $140m (£90m) domestically in its first six days. The new origin film stars British actor Andrew Garfield as the superhero and Emma Stone as love interest Gwen Stacy. It comes five years after Spider-Man 3, starring Tobey Maguire in the lead. Distributor Sony said the latest film has generated $341.2m overall, including worldwide box office receipts. ""This was never modelled or was never meant to be Spider-Man 4,"" said Rory Bruer, Sony's head of distribution. ""This was always a relaunch with a new cast and different stories to tell, and quite frankly, it succeeded beyond our imaginations."" Last week's number one film Ted - about a man and his foul-mouthed talking teddy bear - slipped to number two taking $32.6m (£21m). Pixar's Brave remained at three, bringing its US total to $174.5m (£112.6m). Oliver Stone's drug-war thriller Savages was the highest new entry at four. With an ensemble cast featuring Salma Hayek, John Travolta and Benicio Del Toro, the film tells the story of two friends who face off with members of a Mexican drug cartel. Male stripper movie Magic Mike, starring Channing Tatum and Matthew McConaughey, fell three places to five. The other nationwide release, pop star Katy Perry's behind-the-scenes film Part of Me, was at eight with $7.1m (£4.6m). After opening on Thursday, it has taken $10.3m (£6.6m). However the figure is considerably lower than other recent concert movies - 2008's Hannah Montana & Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert, opened with $31.1m (£20m), while last year's Justin Bieber: Never Say Never, debuted with $29.5m (£19m). Meanwhile, Disney has become the first film studio this year to reach $1bn (£645m) in domestic grosses, according to Variety . The success has been due to the release of blockbuster The Avengers - which has taken $611.1m (£394.6m) alone - Pixar's Brave and film flop John Carter.","The Amazing Spider-Man has spun its way to the top of the US box office chart, taking $65m (£42m) in its opening weekend."
"By Kev GeogheganArts and entertainment reporter The play co-stars John Simm, Keith Allen, Ron Cook, Gary Kemp and John Macmillan. Chan plays Ruth, the wife of Teddy, the eldest and most successful of three sons who has returned to London from the US where he is greeted by his physically and mentally abusive father and his brothers and uncle. Gemma - this play is quite an intense experience for the audience and, we suspect, the cast? Yes it's full on, it doesn't let up at all - you can't drop your concentration for a second. It's a wonderful play because there's no fat on there. In every moment there is something going on, the power is shifting or the dynamics of the scene. I've not watched it from the outside but when you're in it, it's very full on. It's been 50 years since it was written, does it still resonate? It's wonderful writing and Pinter, in a way, these characters he created - particularly the male characters and their attitudes and the way they behave - it's still quite shocking. I can't imagine how shocking it would have been in 1965 but I think he created characters that are still incredibly interesting. The traits that you see in certain characters you can still see in society today. I still think the play's got something to say and I love my character - she's been fascinating to explore and try and understand where she's coming from. A lot of people think she's controversial and ask why she behaves the way she behaves, and it's been really interesting trying to work that out. There's a great deal of ambiguity in the role of Ruth. There is a lot of ambiguity with the character and in [Pinter's] text, but as you work on it you have to make choices and decide what your truth is. It was interesting to work with [director] Jamie [Lloyd] and the other actors to say: ""What is the truth with these characters, what's happened between Teddy and Ruth and their marriage?"" And could that change after you start doing more performances? It could well change. We've got three months to go and I have my own ideas of what she might do next and I'm looking forward to getting to grips with that. What about getting to grips with the text? With Pinter everyone says it's as much about the pauses as the lines of dialogue. I've loved it. I love a pause and a silence so I will happily milk those. But Jamie said to us when we were rehearsing: ""You've got to explore why the pause might be there, they're not just there by coincidence."" He's put them there for a reason - sometimes it might just be because he thinks there will be a laugh, other times there's something going on between the characters and you have to allow that to be alive on stage. It's been really technical but once you have examined it forensically, you can then just enjoy what he's written. You're the only actress in the cast - most of the actors are a lot older than you, have they shared their experiences? I'm the same age as John Macmillan (who plays amateur boxer Joey) but I can't compete with their anecdotes during rehearsal, they have a few between them. They have been wonderful - there are quite a few personalities in there but I can honestly say that we didn't fall out once, which was great. All the drama was in the scenes, there's been a lot of laughter. Your career is very much taking flight right now with the success of things like Humans on Channel 4, what's next? I don't know, I haven't really got a master plan. After this, I have to do Humans series two and that's five months of next year. Then I'm open to to anything interesting that comes up. Humans was a big success, tapping into our fears in our tech-obsessed age, was that something you recognised? Absolutely, I have a love/hate relationship with technology. It's frightening how much we rely on it but how little we understand it and when it breaks, we're screwed because we don't know how to fix it. I hate that but at the same time, I couldn't live with without it. I think the show's resonated with people because of their dependence on and wariness of rapidly advancing technology. Have you seen the scripts for series two? Do you know where its going? I haven't, I've heard some rumours but they are keeping me in the dark too. Where would you like to see it heading? I'd love to see it expand and to see what's going on in other parts of the world. I'd love the characters to be moving on and exploring, particularly my character. I've heard that the scripts are very good though. The Homecoming runs at the Trafalgar Studios until 13 February.","Humans star Gemma Chan is the sole actress in a 50th anniversary production of Harold Pinter's Homecoming, a darkly ambiguous look at issues including masculinity, abuse and repression surrounding the return of one of three brothers to his father's London home."

"It wasn't very good. The actor, who died on Wednesday aged 103, had optioned the rights to Howard Fast's novel - and the film would go on to become Douglas's best-known movie. The star originally enlisted the author to adapt his own work for the big screen, but Fast was not used to writing screenplays and struggled with the format. Douglas urgently needed someone to rescue the script before the historical epic went into production. That sparked a sequence of events which helped end the so-called Hollywood blacklist - the 1950s ban on scriptwriters and film-makers with alleged communist sympathies. When it came to producing movies, Douglas was a perfectionist. ""He was a person who had integrity,"" Tim Gray, senior vice president at Variety magazine, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""He'd be the first to admit that he wasn't easy to work with, but he was always fighting to make a better film."" Douglas hired Dalton Trumbo to rewrite the script for Spartacus, which Trumbo did in just two weeks. But Trumbo had been a member of the Communist Party in the 1940s, so was blacklisted by Hollywood at the end of the decade. He and nine other writers and directors, collectively known as the Hollywood Ten, were jailed for contempt of Congress in 1950 after refusing to co-operate with authorities, who were on the hunt for communists and sympathisers. A pamphlet circulated at the time identified 151 professionals in the entertainment industry who were thought to be communists. Those named could no longer work in Hollywood - at least not using their real names. And if they did keep working under pseudonyms, they had to do so at very cheap rates. In his 2012 memoir I Am Spartacus!: Making A Film, Breaking The Blacklist, Douglas wrote about hiring Trumbo, who planned to rewrite the script under the name Sam Jackson. ""I gave my new friend 'Sam' a copy of the book and he promised to read it right away,"" Douglas said. ""I had been thinking a lot about the day when the blacklist would end."" 'A tremendous risk' It became widely known in Hollywood that Trumbo had written Spartacus. A gossip columnist, Walter Winchell, ran an item in March 1959 outing him as the screenwriter. That perhaps paved the way for what Douglas did next. Douglas said he told Trumbo that once the film was finished, ""not only am I going to tell them that you've written it, but we're putting your name on it"". In August 1960, the studio Universal-International announced that the writer would receive a full screen credit as Dalton Trumbo. The blacklist was effectively broken. ""The masquerade was over,"" Douglas later wrote. ""All my friends told me I was being stupid, throwing my career away. It was a tremendous risk. But the blacklist was broken. ""I wasn't thinking of being a hero and breaking the blacklist. It wasn't until later I realised the significance of that impulsive gesture."" In fact, Douglas claimed to have first broken the blacklist nine months earlier by requesting that Universal Studios issue a parking pass for Trumbo - which was significant because it was issued under the writer's real name. Either way, Rebecca Keegan, senior film editor at the Hollywood Reporter, told BBC Radio 5 Live that Douglas's actions were ""pretty extraordinary"". ""It was a radical thing to do at the time, it was a huge statement,"" she said. ""Douglas put his real name in the credits. It was one of the most significant acts in ending the use of the blacklist, which had had such an oppressive effect in Hollywood."" Keegan says Douglas used his star power to make sure Trumbo got the credit he deserved. ""The fact that Hollywood was using these blacklisted screenwriters, paying them pennies on the dollar, and not allowing them to use their real names, he thought that was absurd,"" she explained. ""And he had enough power at that point that he could make a decision like that and have a profound impact on the industry."" Later in his career, Douglas revelled in telling people how he had broken the blacklist. But some have argued that he overstated the part he played. Trumbo's daughter, Melissa, said that when his 2012 book was published, she ""threw it across the room"". In 2002, Trumbo's widow Cleo wrote a letter to the LA Times saying ""no single person can be credited with breaking the blacklist"". Nonetheless, Douglas became the public face of the blacklist rebellion, which would have taken some courage in itself, even if just as one member of a growing movement. Speaking to the Jewish Chronicle in 2012, Douglas said: ""I have been working in Hollywood over 60 years and I've made over 85 pictures, but the thing I'm most proud of is breaking the blacklist.""

"The piece, which is a dialogue about umbrellas between two unnamed sunbathing gentlemen, was part of a revue at Nottingham Playhouse in 1960. Pinter's widow Lady Antonia Fraser told The Guardian she had been ""completely unaware"" it existed. The British Library acquired Pinter's papers a year before his death in 2008. But Umbrellas was uncovered by researchers delving into the Lord Chamberlain's collection. The 10-minute piece featured in a show called You, Me and The Gatepost. Before 1968, copies of every work intended for performance had to be submitted to the state office for licensing and were retained in its archives. The show was given the green light without any cuts and considered to be an ""excellent entertainment"". Lady Antonia called the sketch - which has been reproduced in full in The Guardian - ""fun"" and said that her family had been acting out the sketch, in which the two protagonists are simply called 'A' and 'B'. ""I want to act B, which is the better part, but so far I've only managed to act A. ""We're really waiting for some really good actors to do it,"" she added. Jamie Andrews, head of English and Drama at the British Library, said the sketch offered ""an exciting and important opportunity for all lovers and scholars of Pinter to study a piece of writing that even the writer himself had not retained"". The piece is punctuated by a series of pauses, which are considered to be a hallmark of Pinter's work. At the time of The Umbrella's performance, Pinter, then aged 29, was enjoying success with a West End production of his play The Caretaker. The sketch's rediscovery coincides with the opening of the newly-rededicated Harold Pinter Theatre in London. Actress Thandie Newton is making her West End debut in Death and The Maiden, the first production in the renamed Comedy Theatre. Pinter, whose other stage plays include The Birthday Party and The Homecoming, was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature in 2005.",A short sketch written by playwright Harold Pinter more than 50 years ago has been found in archives at the British Library.
"By Alex TaylorEntertainment reporter So sang Britney Spears on her 2004 single My Prerogative. More than 15 years on, in the week that a new documentary, Framing Britney Spears, aired in the US, those words are echoing once again. The New York Times film turns the spotlight on the singer's treatment by the press before her public breakdown in 2007 and the ongoing dispute over her conservatorship - an arrangement that means she doesn't control many aspects of her own life and career. The documentary has led to renewed criticism about her treatment within the bubble of 00s celebrity culture, and has sparked some soul-searching in the media. ""We are all to blame for what happened to Britney Spears,"" read an apology from Glamour magazine to the pop star on Instagram on Tuesday. Blogger Perez Hilton has similarly said he is ""so sorry"" for how he behaved. Speaking on his podcast this week, he said: ""My words and actions were wrong. I was nasty, mean, cruel, inconsiderate, awful. I have apologised to Britney not just publicly, but privately."" Amid this reckoning, Spears' treatment at the hands of the entertainment media machine feels outdated in today's climate - but has the celebrity experience really changed? 'A laboratory experiment' It's hardly unusual for celebrities to face intrusion and a loss of privacy at the height of their fame. However for Britney, as a young woman who had carried a manufactured 'girl next door' image of sexualised innocence since her teens, the glare of the spotlight felt especially intense. ""We can see Britney within a long line of women artists - from Marilyn Monroe to Whitney Houston and Amy Winehouse - who have been judged, not so much for the work that they produce but for the way in which they have been represented by the press,"" says Lucy Robinson, culture historian at the University of Sussex. Nowhere was this clearer than during Britney's 2003 television interview with US journalist Diane Sawyer. ""She's like a laboratory experiment in the insulating power of relentless fame,"" the broadcaster told viewers. ""Remember, no high school or college life to practise dating, no anonymity for trial and error and embarrassing choices."" Despite this apparent understanding, the tone of her questioning, which was persistent and accusatory in its focus on Britney's relationships and sex life, left the then 21-year-old in tears. At one point, Sawyer suggested the singer had ""disappointed a lot of mothers in this country"". Double-standards? The interview also pointed to another pressure - speculation over Britney's personal life. As a clean-cut teen role model, she had sworn herself to chastity until marriage, but made headlines when she admitted to breaking this pledge with pop star boyfriend Justin Timberlake. When the couple split, Timberlake sparked rumours of Britney's infidelity by including a cheating lookalike in his video for Cry Me a River. Sawyer pointedly questioned her morality on both counts in her interview, leading Britney to become emotional. ""The obsession with Britney's virginity absolutely highlights the sexual double standard between men and women, but more than that highlights how institutional the sexual exploitation and objectification of young girls is at the heart of the media and pop industry,"" says Robinson. ""There is no space in that context for younger women to own their own sexuality or explore it with agency. Instead they become responsible for adult men sexualising them, in the industry and in the audience."" Timberlake spoke freely about taking her virginity in radio interviews as he launched his solo career. After moving on from Britney, he famously appeared to grope Kylie Minogue's bottom on stage at the 2003 Brit Awards, earning him the nickname Justin Trousersnake, and was involved in Janet Jackson's infamous ""wardrobe malfunction"" at the 2004 Super Bowl. 'Lack of empathy' Meanwhile, the intense speculation around Britney's private life continued as her marriage to dancer Kevin Federline - the father of her two children - collapsed. The very public breakdown followed in 2007, with Britney shaving her head in full view of cameras, acting erratically and eventually being taken to hospital in an ambulance and sectioned after being deemed a danger to herself and others. Her father Jamie Spears has been her conservator, or legal guardian, since 2008, due to concerns about her mental health. The intense media coverage of the breakdown underscored ""the real lack of empathy that was shown towards Britney"", says The Guardian's deputy TV editor Hannah Davies. ""A clear dehumanisation took place. A sense that Britney's actions were seen as existing in a parallel universe to all of the stresses and pressures of being in the spotlight. ""The judgement towards her was so socially acceptable too - think of all of the merch that mocked her breakdown, greetings cards and mugs about Britney surviving 2008. It feels so cheap to me, looking back."" Jen Offord, writer and co-presenter of the Standard Issue podcast, feels society has traditionally been ""socialised not to believe women, or take their health problems seriously"". ""I'm roughly the same age as Britney, so I don't think it occurred to me until around the time of the shaved head incident that the media was particularly tough on her,"" she says. ""It became painfully obvious to me how ill she was, and yet the public discourse around it was relentlessly unkind."" Part of the subsequent shift in mindset stems from an increased understanding around mental health and the media's role within in it - particularly following the death of Love Island presenter Caroline Flack last year. ""In the aftermath of her suicide, the public were suddenly extremely concerned about kindness in the media, but we as the public consume the very articles she was hounded over - they would not be written without our interest in the sometimes very obviously declining mental state of the central subjects. ""Kindness should not only be retrospective."" A new era? So, does this mean the treatment of celebrities is softening? Commentator Mic Wright says the positive response to Jesy Nelson's departure from girl group Little Mix last year, citing the need to protect her mental health, suggests the the media understands it can no longer be as ""nakedly brutal"". ""The tabloids know they need to pay lip service to mental health concerns and the right to a private life, but they still become obsessed with particular stars and put them under an enormous amount of pressure,"" he says. But despite increased awareness, Hannah Davies isn't entirely sure the celebrity ecosystem is necessary kinder - but simply evolving into a ""new industrial complex"" between traditional and new media. ""I think we have a much better understanding of mental health now, but even so - watching Britney being harangued by paparazzi and seeing those headlines isn't something that's unique to the late 2000s. ""We're still seeing celebrities used and abused by the media, and the advent of reality TV and social has only made that surveillance more constant, and increased this conveyor belt of people whom the tabloids can support and then turn on. ""The BBC series Celebrity: A 21st Century Story showed how the relationship has grown and changed through social media, including Instagram and YouTube."" But while the power of these platforms can be destructive, as Nelson frequently discussed prior to her departure, they can also be empowering for celebrities. 'Take control' Would it have helped Britney in the early 00s? Indirectly, it already has. The legal battle around her conservatorship has been played out against the backdrop of the online #FreeBritney movement, led by fans who believe Spears is being controlled against her will. ""Social media has allowed celebrities to take control of their truth and rebut claims quickly,"" says The Independent's head of audience Beth Ashton. ""When someone instantly challenges a claim and shares it with their millions of followers, it's impossible to ignore. ""The story changes and the headlines change too."" And, after the documentary came out, Britney, now 39, took to social media to say the public cannot know what life is like for ""the actual person living behind the lens"". ""Would early noughties Twitter and Instagram be kinder to Britney than the media industry?"" asks Ashton. ""I'm not sure, but at least, as her posts during her conservatorship battle and after the documentary have shown, it would have given her a voice.""

"By Tim MastersEntertainment correspondent in Toronto The upbeat message emerged during a special Brexit debate at the Toronto International Film Festival on Friday. ""As an industry we are born problem solvers,"" said Robbie Allen of Creative Scotland, adding that there was ""time to plan"" for the ""bump in the road"". Isabel Davis, of the British Film Institute, said ""nothing changes"" until after what would be a long process. Ms Davis, head of international at the BFI, explained that it had set up a ""screen task force"" to look at threats and opportunities presented by the result of June's EU referendum. She said the film industry was keen to preserve its relationship with Europe and that no changes were imminent during the exit process. ""We are talking about a period of time that is going to be rather extended,"" she said. ""This is a very complicated process, it's a marriage that is going to take quite a lot of time to untangle. ""In the meantime, the key message is nothing changes whatsoever. Until those negotiations are concluded, we are exactly as we have always been."" 'Bad dream' Her assessment was echoed by Oscar-nominated producer Paul Webster, whose credits include The English Patient and Shakespeare in Love. ""I still wake up every morning thinking [the referendum result] was a bad dream,"" said Mr Webster, who owns Shoebox Films in partnership with director Joe Wright and producer Guy Heeley. He pointed out that tax credits for film-making and international co-productions would be unaffected by Brexit. ""As a producer about 80% involves working with American companies,"" he said. ""But independent film does rely heavily on European partners - that's the area of key concern."" He said he'd not noticed any change in the amount of private equity being used to fund films. ""We live in a global economy, where there's an enormous amount of money washing around,"" he noted. ""Europe is not our only partner,"" added Mr Allen, as the Brexit debate drew to a close. ""It's going to be a bump in the road but it's a bump in the road we can see coming. There's time to plan.""

"By Emma JonesEntertainment reporter Figures published by the Directors Guild of America showed that in 2013 and 2014, 6.4% of Hollywood films were made by women, while just over 1% of movies were made by women from ethnic minority backgrounds. Arnold, who has won an Oscar, two Baftas, and four prizes at Cannes Film Festival since she started directing 18 years ago, says she saw the statistics recently, and ""was so shocked at the amount of women directors"". ""The figures were so small. We actively have to employ more females, perhaps we need to at this point. There are a lot of capable women out there."" 'Mainly male stories' Arnold's latest film, American Honey, follows an African American heroine, Star, as she travels across the US with a road crew selling magazine subscriptions. It won the Jury Prize at this year's Cannes Film Festival, and is showing at this year's BFI London Film Festival. The director believes that ""we've grown up mainly on male stories, and most of the films have been written and directed by men - and that's only half of the human race"". ""I remember going to a women's film festival and feeling a slight amount of trepidation, but actually it was fantastic. Some of the films made me cry because they really spoke to me,"" she recalls. ""It was then I realised up till then I had mostly been spoken to by men in cinema."" All of Arnold's four feature films are centred around a female story, and three are set, including American Honey, during the teenage transition to womanhood. It's a time Arnold calls "" very precious, and very interesting - there are a lot of hormones flying. And I always wanted to do a girl's road trip story, a coming of age"". The desire to make the film had been with Arnold, she says, since she saw a New York Times article some years ago detailing the so-called ""Mag Crews"", itinerant young people who travel across the US, sleeping in camper vans, and going door to door, scratching a living by selling magazine subscriptions. To research and write it, the director took her own road trip, starting off from Salt Lake City, Utah, ""as the sun came up, with the freeway ahead of me, and Spirit in the Sky on the radio. 'Intense poverty' ""We're all fascinated by America, aren't we? We've all grown up with the idea of it."" ""I wasn't trying to subvert the American Dream with my story but it's complicated - this belief that you can have whatever you want, as long as you stick at it,"" she says. ""It depends how well you started in life - and if you started in poverty, without proper parenting, how easy is it to find the self-confidence to do what you want to do? ""And if you don't do it, that's doubly hard - you are stuck with a sense of failure."" Arnold's journey took her through some states, where she says ""I didn't fully understand how intense the poverty would be"". She describes driving through a town in Oklahoma ""where everything was shut - the whole high street, the factories, everything"". ""There were people there, but nothing for them. I suppose that's when certain political messages get appealing - when you can't even access a doctor or a dentist. It made me profoundly grateful for the NHS, actually."" The film stars Shia La Beouf as the crew leader, Jake, and a 21-year-old Texan, Sasha Lane, who was ""discovered"" by Arnold and her scouts. ""It was Spring Break and we were on a Florida beach,"" Arnold recalls, ""and there were 20,000 teenagers on that beach. At first she was careful, because there were actually people out there recruiting for pornography films too. ""She just had a certain something - she was very awake and alive, she was very present with us when we spoke to her."" Arnold also employed first-time actors in her previous films, Wuthering Heights and Fish Tank, and admits: ""I like it because they provide a faithful representation of the world that I am seeking to portray. Shia LaBeouf 'mucked in' ""It's often easier to use 'real' people; you can genuinely believe it's the life they have led just by looking at their faces. Sometimes I feel I am making life difficult for myself, as they never do quite what you expect them to do. ""But they never repeat themselves, they bring something different and no take is the same."" Shia LaBeouf, she adds, ""just mucked in with everyone, we got on really well from the first moment we met"". ""He strikes me as an actor looking to do things in a different way. He was up for the adventure and stayed for the duration of the whole trip, as I wanted him to. There was no flying in and out, just staying in the same motel rooms as the rest of the crew."" Arnold often drove her cast from one location to another, and early on, sent them to try and sell magazine subscriptions for real, ""or how else would they have the experience? So I sent them off, and the first time was OK, we had a 'Mag Manager' come and teach them the craft, and they even made some money. 'We lived together for two months' ""However the next time we did it again, on a housing estate in Nebraska, the police were called and we got chased away - I think the residents were more protective. ""The people in my film are very much like the real magazine crew that I read about and met. ""It was a huge experience for all of us, I think - we lived together for two months. They say road trips change everyone and at the end of that period, I sensed a great deal of sadness from them, that it would all come to an end.""

"Stars from the original series including Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher joined newcomers including John Boyega and Daisy Ridley. The plot of the film remains a closely-guarded secret and a media embargo on reviews is in place until Wednesday. But some reviewers did post positive, if brief, comments on Twitter. Adam B Vary, senior film reporter for Buzzfeed, tweeted: ""Rest easy: TheForceAwakens is 100% StarWars"", while LA Times film writer, Rebecca Keegan, wrote: ""Story, characters, design, humour - StarWars fans, this is the movie you're looking for."" Her colleague Steve Zeitchik tweeted: ""From comedy to costumes, fights to fx to overall feel, JJ Abrams has created a thoroughly old-fashioned movie."" And actor Rob Lowe was also enthusiastic, tweeting: ""There's a new hero in town, in a movie that DELIVERS. Cried like a baby, whooped like a teen!"" Actress Elizabeth Banks, who attended the premiere, was also impressed. She tweeted: ""StarWarsForceAwakens totally delivers no spoilers I repeat no spoilers again no spoilers just wow."" According to Matthew Belloni, executive editor at Hollywood Reporter and Billboard, one man was forcibly removed from the premiere. Fans had been camping out for days outside the TCL Chinese Theatre, which along with other LA venues screened the seventh Star Wars instalment. Security was tight, with a giant tent shrouding the red carpet. The TCL Chinese Theatre - formerly known as Grauman's Chinese Theatre - showed the first Star Wars movie in 1977. More than 150 fans lined up to buy tickets for the first public screenings of Episode VII on Thursday but they got a surprise when they were all invited into one of the three cinemas showing the premiere. But two fans, Australians Caroline Ritter and Andrew Porters, turned down the offer because they are getting married on the forecourt of Hollywood Boulevard on Thursday and will be watching the film with their friends and family afterwards. Mr Porters said: ""They invited us in. We declined. It's part of our wedding reception with friends so we passed to see it on Thursday. It was hard but it is the right decision."" Ms Ritter will walk down the makeshift aisle in a white dress accompanied by Darth Vader, while Mr Porters will wear a traditional suit but with a Stormtrooper bow tie and braces. On the red carpet: BBC News entertainment correspondent Lizo Mzimba Fans, many in costume, camped out for days for the chance to see the stars on the red carpet for what is probably the most eagerly awaited film of the decade. The size and scale are a reflection of the enduring popularity of this sci-fi saga, and of the anticipation surrounding this latest instalment. The red carpet here is around half a mile long, under a huge marquee which stretches the length of four blocks of Hollywood Boulevard. The world premiere itself has taken over three different cinemas, and 4,000 guests are expected. Security has been tight with everyone entering the area around the event subject to bag searches and metal detectors. There is a huge degree of excitement surrounding what is rivalling the Oscars as the film event of the year. Disney, the studio behind the film, is hoping this will all give this new Star Wars movie a stellar launch. They paid more than $4bn (£2.6bn) for the rights to the franchise. Anticipation for the film has been huge, and in October some cinema websites collapsed under the weight of demand for tickets. Stormtroopers joined robots C-3PO and R2-D2 on the red carpet as the human stars arrived at Tuesday's world premiere. ""Now we have to live up to what the first films delivered,'' said Ford, who has returned to his role as Han Solo. Star Wars creator George Lucas was spotted laughing and chatting with The Force Awakens director and co-writer JJ Abrams on the red carpet. Lucas said the latest movie is ""a film about families and what one generation leaves behind another generation has to deal with"". Abrams, who has also directed two Star Trek films, said he was not trying to put his own mark on the franchise. ""I don't look at the things I do from a vantage point of putting a stamp on it, I'm trying to service the master of the stories and the characters,"" he said. Ford said he was not feeling the pressure after so much anticipation. ""It's not my fault, we can blame it on JJ. I just work here,"" he joked. The Force Awakens will have its UK premiere in London on Wednesday.","The hotly anticipated latest addition in the Star Wars franchise, The Force Awakens, has had its world premiere in Los Angeles."
"Outrage has flared after a video of the director speaking in 2013 re-emerged. In it, he admitted he did not fully prepare Maria Schneider before shooting the infamous ""butter scene"" because he wanted her to feel real ""humiliation"". He has now insisted she knew about the scene in advance and that her ""rape"" by Marlon Brando's Paul was simulated. The scene from Bertolucci's 1972 film sees Brando's character use butter as a lubricant while forcing himself upon Schneider's Jeanne. In a 2007 interview, Schneider said she had felt ""humiliated"" and ""a little raped, both by Marlon and by Bertolucci"". The actress, who died in 2011, blamed the film, the reaction and her instant fame for her subsequent drug abuse and suicide attempts. In the 2013 video that reignited the controversy, Bertolucci said he and Brando came up with the idea of using butter on the morning the scene was shot. He said he had been ""in a way horrible to Maria because I didn't tell her what was going on, because I wanted her reaction as a girl, not as an actress"". The video shows him admitting he felt ""guilty"" but that he did ""not regret"" how he went about filming the scene. Schneider ""hated me for her whole life"" as a result, he continued. Evan Rachel Wood was among those to express outrage at his comments, calling the situation ""heartbreaking and outrageous"". ""The 2 of them are very sick individuals to think that was ok,"" the Westworld actress wrote. ""To all the people that love this film - you're watching a 19yr old get raped by a 48yr old man,"" actress Jessica Chastain tweeted. ""The director planned her attack. I feel sick."" ""I will never look at this film, Bertolucci or Brando the same way again,"" wrote Captain America star Chris Evans. ""This is beyond disgusting. I feel rage."" Schneider 'not upset by violence' In a statement on Monday, the 76-year-old director said he wanted ""for the very last time to clear up a ridiculous misunderstanding"". ""We wanted her spontaneous reaction to this improper use [of the butter],"" he said. ""The misunderstanding arises from this. ""People thought, and think, that Maria was not informed of the violence she was to suffer. False! ""Maria knew everything because she had read the script, in which it was all described. The only new thing was the idea of the butter. ""It was this, I learned many years later, that upset Maria, and not the violence that was in the scene and was envisaged in the script of the film."" 'I was crying real tears' In her 2007 interview, Schneider said the scene in question ""wasn't in the original script"". ""The truth is it was Marlon who came up with the idea,"" she told the Daily Mail. ""They only told me about it before we had to film the scene and I was so angry. ""I should have called my agent or had my lawyer come to the set because you can't force someone to do something that isn't in the script, but at the time, I didn't know that. ""Marlon said to me: 'Maria, don't worry, it's just a movie,' but during the scene, even though what Marlon was doing wasn't real, I was crying real tears.""

"The bill would modify the definition of harassment in California to include photographing or recording a child without the permission of a guardian. Berry is expected to testify in Sacramento, California, on Tuesday. The legislation specifically mentions photography involving ""following the child's activities or lying in wait"". It also refers to targeting a child because of a parent's line of work. The Academy award-winning actress was seen shouting at photographers taking pictures of her family after arriving at Los Angeles International airport in April with her partner Olivier Martinez and her young daughter. Senator Kevin de Leon, who wrote the bill, also wants to protect the children of public officials, including judges and law enforcement, from harassment, said spokesman Greg Hayes. A first conviction under such new legislation could result in between 10 days and one year in jail, as well as a fine of up to $10,000 (£6,472). Senator de Leon explains in an author's statement, published on his website, that he wishes to amend the original legislation, which was passed in 1994 ""to address the increased harassment faced by the children of health care facility employees where abortion procedures were performed"". ""Although [the bill] has been on the books for nearly 20 years, children continue to fall prey to intentional harassment because the law provided for relatively weak penalties,"" he continued. ""By setting mandatory minimum terms and authorising fines of up to $10,000 for repeated violations, [the amendment] will have a significant deterrent effect."" The Motion Picture Association of America is among several groups that oppose the legislation, saying it infringes upon free speech protections. Jim Ewert, general counsel for the California Newspaper Publishers Association, told the LA Times there were already enough laws preventing harassment and he was concerned it could criminalise legitimate journalism. ""It's what journalists do,"" he said. ""They take pictures."" Other organisations in opposition include the National Press Photographers Association and the California Broadcasters Association. Supporters include the California Police Chiefs Association and the Los Angeles District Attorney's Office.","Halle Berry is to testify in favour of new legislation which would limit the paparazzi's ability to photograph stars' children, the LA Times reports."
"By Sabrina SweeneyEntertainment reporter, BBC News ""I collect stories,"" says singer Aluna Francis. ""A couple of the songs are a story that [bandmate George Reid] has told me, a couple are friends and stories they've told me. ""People tell me a lot of stuff and I find it really fascinating."" Francis' friends will be listening closely when the pair's debut album comes out later this year. Some banter ensues as Reid suggests his partner is ""exploiting"" people's stories. Not so, says Francis, who seems ever ready to put a positive spin on things. ""Hey, you wouldn't like your story made into a song?"" she asks, smirking. ""Sometimes you think no-one cares and no-one's listening to what your saying. But actually, they've been inspired by your story and written a song about it. All's fair in life."" It is not just their friends who will be listening closely - Aluna and George's combination of glitchy R&B with futuristic (yet sweetly melodic) electro-pop has led critics to predict a bright future for this duo. As well as second place on the Sound of 2013 list, they were also nominated for the Brit Awards' Critics' Choice prize. ""It's absolutely incredible, we're loving it,"" enthuses Francis about the response. ""It makes a massive difference about how we feel about going into the year and getting out there."" They have always been ""quite tricky to please"" and quick to put pressure on each other (""in a nice way"", says Reid), but the reaction is a ""warm validation"" that has confirmed their sound is ""not just good to our ears,"" he says. ""There is a little bit more pressure now because people expect a certain level or certain feel to the music, but that pressure is a massive blessing,"" he says. AlunaGeorge formed in June 2009 while Francis was in another band, the London-based synth-pop quartet My Toys Like Me. Getting together with Reid - who was remixing a My Toys Like Me track - ignited a spark that could not be ignored, the pair say, and they began working on their own material. Francis is nonchalant about cutting her losses with her former bandmates. ""The stuff me and George made was too enticing. I was too curious to know what it was we could do together to give it up for something I had already worked on for long enough to know it wasn't going to move on."" After bonding over Radiohead and Michael Jackson, ideas flowed as the pair took a ""very collaborative"" approach in the studio. ""We take it in turns to inspire each other to finish off an idea that might have started with [Reid's] beats or something he's written, or something I've messed around with on the piano,"" says Francis. Since releasing their debut EP You Know You Like It in June, the pair have been described as ""thrillingly futuristic"" by The Guardian and ""lustrous"" by Pitchfork. ""We take [our music] to its bare bones,"" the singer says. ""We've got good beats that are either sexy or dancy and then songs on top."" So, what is the back-up plan if the stories run out or they are unable to meet the challenge? It turns out neither has one. ""You can't have fall back plans in this game,"" insists Francis. ""They're pointless. No fall back plans will ever make up for you not getting to the point you want to get to in the dream job."" Reid is a little less emphatic: ""They're wise to have, but I dug myself into a hole so deep with music. I didn't get much education after college, so it kind of needs to work out"". 'Tricky' journey A former guitarist in math-pop band Colour, Reid admits the journey to this point has been ""tricky"". ""Although the public perception may be that it's been a quick rise, it hasn't been fast or necessarily easy."" ""Nothing comes easily,"" interrupts Francis. ""But I've enjoyed every second getting to this point, because it's all meant something to me personally. ""If you've got the motivation for something, it makes the ups and the downs part of this cool journey."" A little more upbeat, Reid adds: ""We've been really fortunate to be on a steady slope upwards, and if that continues we'll be very happy.""","The BBC Sound of 2013 list showcases some of music's most exciting emerging stars, selected by more than 210 leading critics, bloggers and broadcasters.

"The book, published in 2001, was originally billed as one of Harry Potter's Hogwarts textbooks. Warner Bros chief Kevin Tsujihara persuaded author Rowling to adapt the book for the big screen. Last week, he told the New York Times there would be a trilogy of films based on the book, which follows a ""magizoologist"" named Newt Scamander. Scamander is the author of a guide to magical creatures. Set in New York, the book is neither a sequel nor a prequel, but an ""extension"" of Harry Potter's ""wizarding world"", Rowling said. Last month, Rowling told actress Emma Watson, who played Hermione Granger in the Harry Potter films, that she completed the draft script in 12 days. Rowling herself told the newspaper that it was Tsujihara - who took over the role of CEO at Warner Bros last year - who persuaded her to adapt the book. ""We had one dinner, a follow-up telephone call, and then I got out the rough draft that I'd thought was going to be an interesting bit of memorabilia for my kids and started rewriting,"" she told the New York Times. ""When Kevin got the top job, he brought a new energy, which rubbed off. He's a very engaging person, thoughtful and funny."" The project, which was first announced in September 2013, will be produced by Harry Potter regular David Heyman, whose recent successes include Gravity. ""I always said that I would only revisit the wizarding world if I had an idea that I was really excited about and this is it,"" said Rowling when the film was announced last year. The book was written by Rowling between the publication of the fourth and the fifth books in the Harry Potter series. It is set 70 years before we first meet Harry. More than 450 million copies of Rowling's seven Potter books have been sold worldwide. Aside from Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, she also wrote the short book Quidditch Through the Ages - another of Harry's schoolbooks. They were published in aid of Comic Relief.

"By Mark SavageBBC Music reporter It's the strongest line-up since 2004 - when Britney's Toxic went up against Jay-Z's incendiary 99 Problems. Both lost, however, to Outkast's irresistibly technicolour clip for Hey Ya! This year's contenders span a similar gamut, encompassing everything from searing political commentary to Latin American melodrama. Collectively, they illustrate how videos have become an extension of the artist's vision, fundamental to the message of the song rather than a throwaway piece of fluff. Any of the shortlisted six songs could win - although Kanye's presumably got his money on Beyonce. Here's a refresher on the videos in contention for a Moonman. ARIANA GRANDE - No Tears Left To Cry No Tears Left To Cry was Ariana Grande's first single after a terrorist bomb claimed the lives of 22 fans outside her concert in Manchester last May. The shape-song reflects the star's turbulent emotions, and her determination to persevere, as it cuts between elegiac gospel harmonies and a defiant dancefloor shuffle, never quite settling into a single mood. The video continues the theme, thrusting Grande into an Inception-style cityscape that constantly topples over and throws her off balance. ""We wanted to explore was the disorientation that you go through in life, and the quest we all go through to find the ground again,"" explained director Dave Meyers (who won last year's best video award for Kendrick Lamar's Humble). ""We sort of flirt with the ambiguity of whether you need to find the ground or whether the ground's just what you make of it."" Touchingly, in the video's final moments, a bee flies towards the screen - serving as an emblem for Manchester and a tribute to the victims. CHILDISH GAMBINO - This Is America This video contains language and images some people may find offensive. The clear front-runner for this year's best video award is Childish Gambino's shockingly brutal but utterly compelling clip for This Is America. Tackling America's gun epidemic head on, it sees the performer (aka actor Donald Glover) dancing gleefully while violence breaks out all around him. He's frequently the perpetrator - in one scene gunning down a choir, in a likely reference to the 2015 massacre at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in South Carolina. But the story is deliberately ambiguous. Are we supposed to recoil from the violence or be entertained by it? The video provides no easy answers, forcing the viewer to confront the two contradictory roles offered to black Americans - gangster or entertainer. ""People are dying in This Is America, but all they want us to do is sing and dance,"" wrote Tre Johnson in a critique for Rolling Stone magazine. ""It's an upsettingly vivid illustration of the Faustian bargain that black America makes on a regular basis, trading our bodies for our expression and freedom."" CAMILA CABELLO ft YOUNG THUG - Havana Another Dave Meyers production, Havana is a marvellously camp melodrama complete with a steamy dance breakdown. Camila says she took inspiration ""from music videos like Thriller"" that blur the lines between fantasy and reality; as she plays Karla, a bookish wallflower who finds escape in her favourite TV shows, imagining herself in the starring roles. There's an autobiographical thread to the story, she told E! News. ""Karla is my first name, Camila is my middle name. Long story short, my family always called me Camila but when I came to school in the United States, I was really, really shy, and the teachers started calling me Karla."" As in the video, Karla/Camila found herself through a combination of music and hard graft. ""In my life, I've pushed myself to do a lot of things that make me uncomfortable,"" she said. ""That's how I started dancing and that's how... I gained that confidence and [became] a video vixen. They're both over exaggerated personas of me, basically."" THE CARTERS - Apes**t This video contains language some people may find offensive. The Carters, in case you hadn't noticed, are hip-hop power couple Beyonce and Jay-Z; and they make an ostentatious show of that power in the video for Apes**t, by taking over the Louvre for an elaborate, symbolically-laden music video. There's enough imagery here to fill a textbook; but the essential point is that they are inserting themselves into a traditionally white environment and claiming their place, not just as as African-Americans, but as creators and consumers of art. It's a radical, visually-lavish video that subverts art history's erasure of black culture. One particularly potent scene focuses on the 19th Century portrait of the Parisian socialite Juliette Recamier. Director Ricky Saiz positions two black dancers, posing as servants, at the woman's feet - adding what the original artist, Jacques-Louis David, left out. ""The overall point is powerfully put,"" wrote Will Gompertz in his review for the BBC. ""The game is up for those institutions - be it Hollywood, Broadway or the Louvre - which have ignored black artists."" DRAKE - God's Plan The most-watched video of the year to date, God's Plan has a simple concept but the execution is beautiful. Directed by Karena Evans, it follows Drake around Miami while he hands out the video's entire $999,631.90 (£785,149.69) budget to those in need. He pays one student's $50,000 (£39,275) university fees, and gives the same amount to a homeless shelter for women. Drake even stops by a supermarket to help out with the groceries. ""Everything you guys want inside the store is free,"" he beams into a megaphone, prompting one customer to stockpile Nutella. It's an undeniably joyous and heart-warming story - although some have questioned the star's motives. ""I don't know the last time I saw a four-minute montage of 'Look at all the nice things I do,'"" said influential New York DJ Peter Rosenberg, who claimed the video was exploitative. It prompted a furious call from the Canadian star who, Rosenberg later recalled, told him, ""this is the most important thing I've ever done"". BRUNO MARS ft CARDI B Finesse (Remix) Bruno Mars's Grammy Award-winning 24K Magic album is a love letter to 1990s hip-hop and R&B - artists like New Edition, Boyz II Men, Heavy D and Mariah Carey. His adoration for the decade is on full display in the fun and funky video for Finesse, which riffs on the opening titles to iconic 90s sketch show In Living Color. Created by Keenen Ivory Wayans, the series rode a wave of black music and comedy at the start of the decade - and helped launch the careers of stars like Jennifer Lopez, Jamie Foxx and Jim Carrey. Mars, who co-directed the video, clearly had fun recreating In Living Color's paint-splattered opening credits; deliberately shooting the footage in low-resolution, a non-widescreen format for that vintage feeling. Giving the clip a modern twist, he also gender-swapped some of the roles - with Mars dancing on a roof like a Fly Girl (the show's all-female dance troupe) and guest star Cardi B recreating Wayans' paint-flinging antics. ""I had sooo much fun doing this video,"" tweeted the star after the video premiered. ""It felt like a BBQ."" Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

"By Mark SavageBBC music reporter We don't need asking twice. For the 4,000-strong audience, this is the first chance we've had to see live music in more than a year. As it's a pilot event for the post-Covid era, masks have been removed and drinks have been drunk. The air is feverish with anticipation but no-one's anticipating a fever: we've all had negative Covid tests. As eight o'clock approaches, the lights dim, the titles roll, the crowd goes nuts. And then... wait, what? It's a pre-recorded performance of Coldplay, on a pontoon in the Thames, playing their new single. That's right. After a year of being forced to watch live music on a screen, The Brits is opening by... er, making us watch some live music on a screen. It's hard to fathom what the organisers are hoping to achieve here. Perhaps they want to ease us in with something familiar? Or maybe they're worried that an actual band playing actual instruments will make everyone spontaneously combust? Instead, whatever sparks the warm-up had ignited are instantly doused. In the section in front of me, two people stand up to dance. Then one thinks better of it and shuffles back into his seat. It's an inauspicious start - but luckily Dua Lipa is just around the corner to save the day. She struts out of a Tube station on to the stage, racing through a slick and thrillingly choreographed hits medley that encompasses more than half of the songs on her recent album, Future Nostalgia. From there, the show finds its footing. Host Jack Whitehall delivers his jokes with just enough edge and charm to sneak past the censors - taking aim at Piers Morgan and Laurence Fox, before introducing Olivia Rodrigo to the stage with the memorable line: ""In the words of Tiger Woods: 'Driver's License, take it away...'"" Rodrigo casually proceeds to cement her status as pop's most promising newcomer with a flawless performance of her ubiquitous ballad, accompanied by several thousand swaying phone lights. Later, Headie One brings together some of UK rap's leading names - including AJ Tracey and Young T & Bugsey - for a searing rendition of Ain't It Different and Princess Cuts, whose modified lyrics took aim at the demonisation of drill music and black youth. ""What else can a drill youth rap about part from my worst days,"" rapped the star, whose real name is Irving Adjei. ""You see me on stage but I was in jail for three of my birthdays. ""Two black Brits stand here at the Brits but still we ain't seen as British"" Powerful and well-received in the arena, it is clearly aiming for the impact of Dave's performance of Black at last year's awards - but the stars' quickfire delivery obscures some of the most effective lines. Elsewhere, Rising Star winner Griff marks out her territory as one-to-watch with a commanding version of her single Black Hole (performed from inside a black hole, in a victory for literalists everywhere); while Olly Alexander and Sir Elton John give a dramatic reading of It's A Sin, reflecting the impact of the Aids epidemic. Theirs is another pre-taped performance, as is The Weeknd's rain-soaked rendition of Save Your Tears, but to cut the organisers some slack, a normal show is simply not possible in the current circumstances. 'Back to normality' While the audience are free to mingle without masks and social distancing, the backstage area still has to adhere to strict Covid rules. That means no dressing rooms and minimal crew, making it almost impossible to stage quick-turnaround performances of the scale we've become used to (many of the acts, I'm told, have had to put on their outfits in a nearby hotel, drive to the venue, then leave again as soon as they come off stage). ""I was mad Elton John wasn't here in person but otherwise it was brilliant,"" says Christy Black, who's come to see the show from Bow in London. ""Honestly, the emotion you feel when you hear live music is like no other. You can't get that from Spotify. You can't get that from YouTube. When you're around people and you're all enjoying it together, it can't get any better."" ""It's nice to be back to normality,"" says Ashley Singh, a college worker from Stratford. ""I've missed live music massively. It's such an important part of our lives. ""To be back here was a real punctuation mark to the end of this pandemic. Next month, hopefully, things will go back to normal."" The majority of the audience are keyworkers, and every mention of their efforts during the Covid crisis receives an instant standing ovation. Dua Lipa leads the charge, backing Dame Elizabeth Anionwu's campaign to give higher wages to nurses. Harry Styles, Rag 'n' Bone Man and Little Mix add their voices to the chorus, too. Even Taylor Swift, who normally lives in LA, praises the ""help and support we got from the NHS"" over the last year. ""To hear Taylor Swift say the words NHS just blew me away,"" says Gemma Fagan, an NHS dietician who specialises in intestinal failure. ""And Dua saying Boris should give us a pay rise? I couldn't cope."" ""We worked so hard during the lockdown without time off,"" says Crystal Ihenachor, a physioptherapist from Leyton. ""Our annual leave was cancelled and some of us even lost our patients. So the fact that they thought of the keyworkers was amazing."" In the end, the actual awards are almost a sideshow - but it's worth noting that, for once, the Brits largely got it right. Dua Lipa's intergalactic disco opus Future Nostalgia is the big winner, scooping album of the year. Billie Eilish is named best international female, confirming her position as the current queen of pop. Taylor Swift is named a global icon because, well, she is one. The Weeknd, so mystifyingly snubbed at this year's Grammys, takes home best international male - and receives a eulogy from Michelle Obama. ""In a tough year, he's provided a light that's pretty blinding and given us all a reason to dance,"" she observes. Meanwhile, Little Mix correct a historic wrong by becoming the first girl band to win best British group. They dedicate their win to all their overlooked predecessors - sending thousands of journalists to Wikipedia to check who beat the Spice Girls in 1997 (Manic Street Preachers, which isn't as bad as it could have been, given that Kula Shaker were also up for the prize). The audience greet every twist and turn with uproarious applause, clearly giddy at being allowed to hear loud music again without the neighbours banging on the walls. ""I'm not going to lie: Prior to this event I was so nervous and anxious about coming out,"" says Shanelle Nwanebi, a marketer from London. ""But once we were in the arena, it just came naturally. It didn't feel like we'd been locked down for a whole year. The whole ambience and environment, I absolutely loved it."" Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

"By Mark SavageBBC 6 Music News A group of fans have spent the last year creating a DVD of the gig by piecing together footage shot by 14 audience members. The band allowed it to be released on the condition that proceeds went to Oxfam's Haiti emergency fund. The film was made available online over Christmas, and has already raised more than $11,500 (£7,300). Radiohead, who are based in Oxford, played the impromptu Oxfam benefit concert at Hollywood's Henry Fonda Theatre, but no official recording was made. But Dr Inez Rogatsky, a fan from New York, attended the gig and ""taped a little bit of video"". After several more fan films found their way onto YouTube, she and another fan Andrea, who lives in Italy, came up with the idea of creating a full-length concert film. ""Collecting the footage took a while - maybe two or three months,"" she told BBC 6 Music. The video was then passed to a third fan, Devin, a civil engineer in California, who began the painstaking nine-month editing process in his spare time. ""It was totally done on weekends, a few hours at a time,"" he said. The film has little of the shaky camerawork and obscured views traditionally associated with fan videos . As Dr Rogatsky explains, that outcome was never guaranteed. Honesty box ""Fourteen separate video recordings doesn't mean that there were 14 people standing there with professional equipment,"" she said. ""Some of the recordings are a few seconds shot on an iPhone. On some of the songs I wish we had better coverage than we did."" ""I'm pretty pleased with the outcome of a lot of the them. There's a sequence in Morning Bell where, in the beginning of the song, Jonny [Greenwood - guitarist] is walking slowly around the stage,"" said Devin. ""He just has a kind of 'caged animal' feel. He's just waiting to unleash."" Dr Rogatsky contacted Radiohead's manager after ""a lot of procrastination"". ""I heard back within two days that it was a great idea. He mentioned that the band wanted us to get donations for Haiti. I suggested a few organisations, and they decided to go with Oxfam."" Oxfam set up a dedicated donations page for the project with an ""honesty box"" system of requesting money from fans who download the film. It echoes the pioneering online release of Radiohead's last album, In Rainbows. The full concert video was uploaded to YouTube and other video-sharing websites on Christmas Eve and, according to its creators, has been downloaded thousands of times. ""It's pretty amazing to me that this was basically 100% crowd-sourced,"" said Devin. ""To the best of my knowledge, every individual that had anything to do with this has never had any personal contact with each other."" Oxfam's Bob Ferguson added: ""We are thrilled to have the support of Radiohead and their smart and motivated fans to help us raise much needed funds for our work in Haiti. ""It's especially important now, as the one-year anniversary of the earthquake is here, that this project helps to remind people that the dire situation in Haiti is far from over, and that continued support from the rest of the world is needed.""","Radiohead have given their blessing to an ""official bootleg"" of their Haiti benefit concert, held last January."

"It follows the company's second round of pilots, in which viewers gave feedback and rated 10 new shows. The After, written and directed by Carter, and Mozart in the Jungle are joined by cop drama Bosch and dark comedy Transparent, Variety said. Representatives of Amazon in the US and the UK were not available to comment. Last year's Amazon pilots saw John Goodman comedy Alpha House and Silicon Valley sitcom Beta commissioned. The After and Bosch will be Amazon's first drama commissions, following the success of original hit series from rival service Netflix, such as House of Cards and Orange is the New Black. The fate of five children's series is still unknown, with Lovefilm and Amazon Prime subscribers voting on Gortimer Gibbon's Life on Normal Street, Hardboiled Eggheads, The Jo B & G Raff Show, Maker Shack Agency and Wishenpoof!. Bosch is based on Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch detective book series and is written by Connelly and Eric Overmyer. The pilot follows the detective, played by Titus Welliver, pursuing the killer of a 13-year-old boy while also standing trial accused of murdering a suspected serial killer. Meanwhile Carter's new offering follows eight strangers thrown together by mysterious forces, who have to help each other survive in a violent world. Light relief comes from Mexican actor Garcia Bernal and British star Malcolm McDowell, who star in comedy drama Mozart in the Jungle, written by Roman Coppola and Jason Schwartzman. Based on Blair Tindall's memoir of the same name, Garcia Bernal plays a conductor at the New York Symphony Orchestra.

"Mr Marshall, who originally owned a music shop in London, founded Marshall Amplification 50 years ago. He had suffered several strokes in recent years, and developed cancer at the end of 2011, his son said. A statement posted on thecompany's websitecalled him a ""legendary man"" who led a ""truly remarkable life"". Jimi Hendrix and Kurt Cobain are among the musicians who used Marshall amps. FormerGuns N' Roses guitarist Slash tweeted: ""The news of Jim Marshall passing is deeply saddening. R & R will never be the same w/out him. But, his amps will live on FOREVER!"" Motley Crue bass playerNikki Sixx also paid tributeon Twitter, saying Marshall was ""responsible for some of the greatest audio moments in music's history - and 50% responsible of all our hearing loss."" Speaking to Radio Four's Front Row programme on Thursday, musician Paul Weller said he used a Marshall amp that was ""at least 40 years old and still sounds fantastic"". ""For me it's the exactly right amp for the job,"" said the former Jam and Style Council frontman. ""I don't know if anyone's particularly improved on it, to be honest."" Jim Marshall began building amplifiers in the early 1960s, using the Fender Bassman amp as a model, creating what later became known as ""the Marshall sound"". After talking to Pete Townshend and Ritchie Blackmore, who were customers at the shop, he realised there was a gap in the market to make a cheaper alternative to the other models available at the time. It took him six attempts to create an amp he was happy with. As the company grew, Mr Marshall expanded his product range, unveiling the Master Volume Marshall amps and the classic JCM800 split channel amps. ""Jim rose to become one of the forefathers responsible for creating the tools that allowed rock guitar, as we know and love it today, to be born,"" the statement said. ""In addition to the creation of the amps, chosen by countless guitar heroes and game changing bands, Jim was also an incredibly humble and generous man who, over the past several decades, has quietly donated many millions of pounds to worthy causes."" Marshall amplifiers were such a fixture of the rock scene that they featured prominently in the spoof documentary This is Spinal Tap. In a famous scene from the film, guitarist Nigel Tufnel proudly showed off his Marshall stack which went up to 11. He explained it was ""one louder"" than usual amplifiers. In 2003, Marshall he was given the OBE for his services to music and charity. He was a regular supporter of Macmillan and the Willen Hospice. He also donated money to the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital in Stanmore, where he was treated for tuberculosis as a child. The Marshall Amps company, which is now based in Bletchley, Milton Keynes, is celebrating its 50th anniversary with a tribute concert at Wembley Arena. Iron Maiden, Slipknot, Whitesnake and The Cult are among the bands who have been lined up to play at the September event. Mr Marshall will be remembered alongside guitarmakers Leo Fender and Les Paul for shaping the sound of the modern electric guitar. He is survived by his children Terry and Victoria and step-children Paul and Dawn.","Guitar amp innovator Jim Marshall, dubbed ""the Father of Loud"" for creating kit used by some of rock's biggest names, has died aged 88."
"Winslet, 36, is recognised for her film career, which took off in 1993 when she won her first big screen role in Peter Jackson's Heavenly Creatures. Based on a real-life murder case in 1950s New Zealand, the film saw Winslet play Juliet Hulme, an English teenager whose intense relationship with a schoolfriend took a disturbing turn. Speaking about her first experience on the film set, Winslet said: ""With Heavenly Creatures, all I knew I had to do was completely become that person. In a way it was quite nice doing (the film) and not knowing a bloody thing."" Naive or not, her performance was garlanded by both Empire magazine and the London Film Critics' Circle. Winslet was soon hired to star in Ang Lee's Sense and Sensibility, a Jane Austen adaptation that proved to be a financial and critical success. The actress scooped her first Bafta for her performance as the flighty Marianne Dashwood, which also saw her nominated for the best supporting actress Oscar. However, it was playing the impetuous Rose Dawson in 1997's Titanic that finally made the Reading-born actress an international star. The film had a notoriously arduous production, with water-logged sets and technical problems that saw the planned 138-day shoot over-run by two weeks. ""Nothing prepared me for the scenes we are shooting,"" wrote Winslet in her diary (later published in Australian Vogue) in January 1997. ""I vow I will look much more carefully at script directions in future! 'Jack and Rose run through flooded corridor' has turned into the most arduous three days of my life. Scared. Terrified."" Contrary to popular belief, the water used on set was not heated, Winslet divulged. ""It is like swimming in the coldest winter in the history of Scottish winters,"" she wrote. ""I am completely freezing."" Despite dire predictions, Titanic became a massive box-office hit - and went on to win 11 Oscars. Winslet was again nominated, this time for best actress. But the success was overshadowed by the death of Winslet's partner of nearly five years - actor and writer Stephen Tredre - from bone cancer, shortly before the film's release. The actress missed the Los Angeles premiere of Titanic to attend his funeral, a decision which imbued her with a distrust of Hollywood. ""Someone I had spent four and a half years of my life with had just died,"" she told The Guardian in 1999, ""and (the film studio) would be having conversations with me, saying things like, 'Look, we understand, this must be a very hard time' and then they'd go on to say, 'but don't you think Stephen would have wanted it?'"" ""I was pretty alarmed by that."" Press damages She met her first husband, Jim Threapleton, on the set of Hideous Kinky, a film about a restless single mother who flees to Morocco. They wed in 1998 and had a child, Mia Honey, together, though their marriage ended in divorce three years later. But her career was in the ascendancy - in 2003, she was again recognised with an Academy award nomination for her supporting role in biopic Iris. The same year, she married the theatre and film director Sam Mendes and Winslet on the island of Anguilla in the Caribbean. Their son, Joe Alfie Winslet Mendes, was born that December in New York. Her fourth Oscar nomination came in 2005 for psychological drama Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind - and two years later, she was nominated again for Little Children, but a win still evaded her. Having had roles in TV shows such as Casualty before she hit the big screen, the actress returned to television to star in an episode of Ricky Gervais's comedy series Extras in 2005. Winslet, who played a fictional, profane version of herself, earned an Emmy nomination for outstanding guest performance in a comedy series. But Winslet's acting ability has not been the only focus of press attention over the years. In 2007, she accepted an undisclosed settlement from Grazia magazine over allegations that she had visited a diet doctor. And in 2009, the actress successfully sued the Daily Mail newspaper over claims she lied about her exercise regime. She later accepted £25,000 in damages. The same year, she finally broke her Oscar duck, winning best actress for her role in The Reader, capping a number of prizes leading up to the Oscars. 'Opened the doors' ""I get very emotional about these things,"" said Winslet at the time. ""I'm too emotional to lose, and I'm too emotional to win."" She also won her second Bafta for her role as Hanna in The Reader, a guard at Auschwitz who was accused of atrocities at the camp. Winslet was also recognised at the 2009 Golden Globes, where she secured a double triumph for The Reader and Revolutionary Road. The following year, Winslet and Mendes split up. In a statement, the couple said the separation was ""entirely amicable and by mutual agreement"". Meanwhile, her career continued to go from strength to strength - she picked up an Emmy award last year for her role in Mildred Pierce, a drama about a woman who bakes her way out of poverty. A month earlier, she found herself in the midst of a real-life drama, when she rescued Sir Richard Branson's mother after a fire broke out on Branson's luxury home in the Caribbean. This year, she celebrated the 3D release of Titanic, acknowledging it had ""opened the doors to lots of wonderful opportunities"". Still the film she is best known for, she said: ""It's never left me... Titanic is part of my DNA."" On her CBE, Winslet said in a statement: ""I am both surprised and honoured to stand alongside so many men and women who have achieved great things for our country. ""And I feel deeply proud to receive this, as a part of an ever expanding community of British actors and film makers who are fortunate enough to be able to contribute to an international industry. ""This makes me very proud to be a Brit!""",Oscar-winning actress Kate Winslet has been made a CBE in the Queen's birthday honours list.
"The first in the five-part series, which is a spin-off from Harry Potter, is released in the UK this Friday. The Guardian gave the film five stars, writing: ""Fantastic Beasts is a rich, baroque, intricately detailed entertainment. Peter Bradshaw's review also praised the ""breathtaking digital fabrications of pre-war New York City"". ""Katherine Waterston is great as Tina and perhaps gives the Rowling universe what it never quite had until now: a really strong young female lead who could tackle the bad guys on equal terms with the man,"" he added. The Daily Mail's Brian Viner said he had previously felt cynical when he heard the Fantastic Beasts series would span five films, but added he had been won over after seeing the first. He wrote: ""The plan to spin Fantastic Beasts into a franchise of its own sounded more than a little exploitative. How much richer does Rowling want to be, I thought?"" ""But maybe she just wants to keep on telling stories, which is fine by me. She's exceedingly good at it."" But Empire's Helen O'Hara gave the film a more lukewarm review, awarding it three stars and commenting that it had some ""structural problems"". ""Rowling's varied beasts are fun, and brilliantly realised by the effects team, but they're ultimately a sideshow, and the numerous action sequences to capture each one can drag. ""Big, bold and teeming with imagination, it is so busy world-building that it occasionally forgets to have fun. But with this heavy lifting done, there's every reason to hope for an even more magical adventure next time."" The Hollywood Reporter said: ""Likely to draw in just about everyone who followed the Potter series and to please most of them, the picture also has things to offer for fantasy-friendly moviegoers who only casually observed that phenomenon. ""The latter group, however, may be less convinced that this spin-off demands the five feature-length instalments Warner and Rowling have planned."" Robbie Collin in The Telegraph awarded the film four stars and praised it for being ""immaculately cast"". He added: ""Possibly by accident, but probably not, a film about a magical zookeeper has turned out to be the most unexpectedly relevant blockbuster of 2016."" ""Fantastic Beasts may take place in the build-up to the Great Depression, but its vision of an America caught in the jaws of fear and paranoia has the stony-grim ring of the here and now."" Writing in The Times, Kate Muir said: ""JK Rowling delivers a magical universe as chiaroscuro as ever, but with plenty of slapstick and surreal hilarity. The film, which ""The big-screen adaptation of her novel has the joyful bonkersness of the early Harry Potter, and less of the lumbering seriousness of the later books and movies."" 'Timeless' political issues Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Front Row, the film's director David Yates and producer David Heyman said the film was set during politically turbulent times, ""in 1926 between the wars, Nazism is just beginning to appear"". Yates said that in the wake of Donald Trump being elected and the UK's Brexit vote, ""it is inevitable that those things resonate and impact"" on the film. Heyman added: ""These issues that we are talking about being very current and resonant are actually very timeless, that's something we probably need to pay attention to. ""But this is an entertainment, a very fun engaging adventure with great characters which does have echoes of today but also 1920s and 1930s Germany and Europe as well."" They added that they worked with puppeteers from the War Horse play to create the Fantastic Beasts in the film. Heyman said the film's star Eddie Redmayne ""spent quite a lot of time working with people who work with animals, to understand their idiosyncrasies, how they moved and fed"". ""Actors have a great imagination but to have something there physically for the camera to frame but also for actors to interact with is important,"" he added.

"Wood, 77, told Radio Times she is not a fan of the trend for remaking old shows such as Dangermouse and Clangers. ""I'm a bit sad,"" she said. ""It comes down to the times we're in: people feel safer remaking hits of the past rather than investing in something new."" Wood also produced hit show In the Night Garden featuring Igglepiggle. ""There are such a lot of programmes being remade and I just feel the children's television industry is worth more than that,"" said Wood, whose new show Twirlywoos begins on CBeebies next week. ""It would be nice if more encouragement was given to new work."" 'Like my children' Woods has been responsible for many of the UK's best-loved children's programmes and characters, including Roland Rat, Rosie & Jim and Brum. The original Teletubbies, starring Tinky Winky, Dipsy, Laa-Laa and Po, ran on the BBC from 1997 to 2001 and sparked a number one single called Teletubbies say 'Eh-oh!' in December 1997. Wood no longer owns the rights to the hit series, which she co-created with Andrew Davenport, as she sold them in 2013 to help fund new programmes. She said she would not be watching the new series, which is due to air on CBeebies later this year, adding: ""I couldn't bring myself to. ""I have nothing against them, it might be brilliant. They tell me they've got the best producer possible on it, so that's a good sign. ""But how could I watch it? All my programmes are like my children. It's like seeing a child remade in somebody else's image. So good luck to them."" Wood's new show Twirlywoos - a ""situation comedy for three to four-year-olds"" - features four bird-like creatures called Great BigHoo, Toodloo, Chickedy and Chick. It uses stop-frame animation rather than hand puppets or people dressed in suits and is unashamedly educational. ""Educational ideas were present in Teletubbies and In the Night Garden but much more subliminally,"" said Wood. ""This show takes in the latest educational research and builds a comedy around it - whereas in the past I've just made a comedy and just by chance some of these ideas happened to be embedded within it.""","Teletubbies creator Anne Wood has said she is ""a bit sad"" that the hit 1990s children's show is being remade, and that she will not be watching it."
"Among them is Paul Kingsnorth's debut novel, The Wake, which was published after 400 readers pledged money to a crowdfunding campaign. The author spoke to the BBC's Rebecca Jones about being longlisted for the Booker Prize, and the unusual birth of his book. What is your reaction to being on the Booker list? Great surprise! I knew the book had been entered for the Man Booker but I didn't expect it to get anywhere near the longlist - it's such a strange and left-field book so I'm very pleased indeed. When you say it's a strange book what do you mean? It's a book that is written entirely in its own language. It's written in a kind of ""shadow tongue,"" as I call it - which is my version of Anglo-Saxon English because the book is set in the Anglo-Saxon period. It's full of very strange mystical episodes and its crowdfunded by Unbound which is an innovative publisher so it's something news and strange in various ways. What did traditional publishers say when they read the book? I got a response from one who said: ""I really like the story, but would you consider writing the story in modern English?"" And I said no because the entire point of the book is that it's written in this tongue which takes you into this world. I can understand the caution - it's a slightly strange beast - but I needed a publisher who could really get what I was doing and I managed to find one. Tell us about the crowdfunding and how that worked. The book is published by Unbound which is a new kind of publisher. The way it works is, in order to get the book published on its initial print run, you have to have enough potential readers pledging to support the book financially. I needed about 400 people to support it so we made a film and went and talked to people and used social media and we managed to persuade 400 hardy souls they wanted to pre-order a copy of the book and at that point the book was published in the normal way. One of the things that makes me so happy being on the longlist is that this book is a collaborative venture. Unbound is a reaction to the great difficulties in the publishing world at the moment and they're trying to create one of many new models of publishing. The Wake is the first crowdfunded book on the Booker longlist but I wouldn't be surprised if it was the last. When you say the great difficulties of publishing what do you mean? I think the publishing industry is in various degrees of turmoil. As far as I can see, the internet is changing the face of publishing hugely, [as is] the power of Amazon. It seems the traditional models of publishing just aren't working anymore. What Unbound is doing and what I've done with this book is one alternative to that - to try and create a publishing model that works for readers and writers, so it's exciting to see it get some endorsement there. What difference do you think this is going to make to you? I have absolutely no idea! I hope it's going to make more people read the book, that would be nice. I really don't know - it's so unexpected I haven't had time to think about it so it's a very nice surprise for me to have received on a Wednesday morning.","The 2014 Man Booker Prize longlist has been announced, with 13 titles vying for the £50,000 award."
"Here, BBC presenters and journalists share their lockdown picks. It's an eclectic list of suggestions for where to look next if you fancy some inspiration. Veteran broadcaster Mark Radcliffe presents BBC Radio 2's Folk Show and 6 Music's weekend chat and music show Radcliffe and Maconie . The Trial Of The Chicago 7 (Netflix) I like a courtroom drama, I must say. For people who don't know the Chicago 7, they were students and hippies and anti-Vietnam protesters who picketed at the 1968 Democratic Party Convention and were arrested for inciting riots. If you remember that year, it was a really highly-charged time. Martin Luther King was assassinated in April, and then Bobby Kennedy in June - so this is an extraordinary snapshot of those times. It still has a resonance, particularly in how the one black defendant is treated. In the time of Black Lives Matter and the George Floyd protests, it reminds you that not everything has changed, by a long way. Shuggie Bain by Douglas Stuart (Picador books) This is set in the time of Thatcherism, and it's a tragic tale of this young lad Shuggie Bain, who is protecting and caring for an alcoholic mother, living in extreme poverty. It's rather Thomas Hardy-esque, in that you know everyone is doomed to disappointment or death, but it feels very real. And like the film, one suspects life hasn't changed very much for a lot of people. The novel is nominated for the Booker Prize, although I don't generally take that as a massive recommendation. I have certainly bought Booker-winning novels and thought they were dreadful. The Queen's Gambit (Netflix) Anya Taylor-Joy plays Beth Harman, who's in an orphanage at the beginning of the film, and is intrigued by the janitor who plays chess. He gradually agrees to teach her and it turns out she's an absolute prodigy. It's based on a novel by someone called Walter Tevis but it feels like it ought to be true. It's about the connections you make as an orphan - friendships and connections and adoption. And there's a lot of chess. In fact, we started playing chess at home, inspired by it, and my wife is miles better than me and she can see several moves ahead. We don't play anymore. It got too annoying. The Asian Network presenter has hosted its breakfast show since 2017, having joined the station in 2015 from community radio. Strictly Come Dancing (BBC One, iPlayer) Watching my next door neighbour Clara [Amfo] absolutely bossing it on screen is amazing. I'm a huge fan of BBC One's Strictly Come Dancing anyway, but seeing Clara shine like a Queen is great. Rooting for her no doubt. And I usually find anything music or dance related to be therapeutic for me. It's fun, an easy watch and it's a great way to wind down. Grab some munchies and sit on the sofa while having your own party. It's perfect. Made In Heaven (Amazon Prime) I've also just finished watching season one of Made In Heaven. A couple of colleagues have been meaning to get me into it and now I'm hooked. It's more of a drama series, but it's so good and keeps you on the edge of your seat at the end of every episode. Can't wait to start the second season. Sister Sister (Netflix) And thirdly, I'm watching Sister Sister, a 1990s US sitcom about twins Tia and Tamera who were separated at birth and reunite 14 years later. It's brought back my youth. And you can never get enough. If you grew up watching Tia and Tamera, you already know how good it is. If you fancy a giggle, put them on."" DJ Friction has been on the BBC airwaves since 2002, and is now presenting the Asian Network's evening show. Space videos (YouTube) It's the biggest kind of escapism - forget pandemics, let's talk about 1,000-year journeys to other galaxies. He devours YouTube series by scientists and futurists John Michael Godier and Isaac Arthur, who use science fact to examine what might actually be possible beyond Earth. They'll swing between stuff that's happening in our solar system to real mad stuff like, what will the universe look like a trillion years from now? And then they'll break it down using real physics and real science. The Real Housewives of America (Sky, ITV Be, Amazon Prime Video) I don't watch much TV or reality shows,"" says Friction. ""But I fell into this hole of watching The Real Housewives of Atlanta and The Real Housewives of Potomac. It wasn't until the summer that I went, 'Wait a minute, they're the only two reality shows from that franchise that feature black women. Every other show features white women. I'm subconsciously dealing with Black Lives Matter, race and everything that's happening this year via these reality shows. Believe me, I've fallen so deep into them. Anyone who asks a question about the seasons or the episodes, I have the answer. The Beatles Friction has been rediscovering The Beatles by listening to all their albums back-to-back again. ""I just got back into it and thought, my God, how did these guys write nearly every genre of music that we're still listening to? And you're telling me they released The White Album and Yellow Submarine and Sgt Pepper within the space of 18 months? It's ridiculous."" Will Gompertz has been arts editor for BBC News since 2009 and before that was a director at the Tate Gallery. What I Love (podcast) I'm loving this podcast, presented by the award-winning theatre director Ian Rickson. It has a simple format: one guest with whom Rickson has worked selects three things he or she loves. Chiwetel Ejiofor included a Michael Kiwanuka song, Kae Tempest picked a book by William Blake. Good listening. Strata: William Smith's Geological Maps (Thames & Hudson) Some books are beautiful, others are enlightening. Strata is both. Packed with exquisite illustrations, it presents the work of William Smith, a 17th Century geologist, who was the first person to comprehensively map the earth beneath our feet. It's the best non-fiction book I've read in a long time. Call My Agent (Netflix) French TV doesn't get that much attention for some reason - but they produce some great programmes. Spiral is the best police procedural on telly, while Call My Agent is the perfect lockdown escape: uptight actor's agents dealing with uptight actors in a Paris office where they end up either bickering or sleeping with each other. Or both. Tres bon! Musician Hannah Peel presents late-night Radio 3 show Night Tracks, which ranges from classical to contemporary music. She was Emmy-nominated last year for her soundtrack for HBO's Games of Thrones: The Last Watch. Notes On Blindness (Download, Netflix) This is a documentary about the writer John Hull, who went blind just before the birth of his son and started to make a diary of audio cassettes. In the film you hear all the actual recording, and it's just incredible. You're immersed in a world of sound, instead of being totally bombarded with visual information. It sounds like it should be a podcast, but it really works as a film - delving into the mind and the body and dreams and memory. I think it's a masterpiece. Bandcamp (Independent music store) I'm Bandcamp all the way, for everything. They do an amazing thing once a month called Bandcamp Friday, where every artist gets 100% of the profit on their merchandise or downloads or CD sales. It's the only place that does that in the music industry. The last thing I bought was a compilation by a wonderful little indie label called Salmon Universe, who put out a lot of ambient, electronic music. I like compilations because you're led to artists from all across the world, from Ohio to Japan. It's amazing. Islands (RTÉ podcast) This is made by the world-renowned sound recordist Chris Watson, who's teamed up with the writer/presenter Luke Clancy to take a journey across the atlas of remote islands, from Ross Island to the Galapagos to the possibly mythical isle of HyBrasil. It's full of stories and sounds, and it's beautiful. I just like the way you can use podcasts to express something emotional, rather than factual. So you get a sense of ethereal escapism within that. Mark has been the BBC's music reporter since 2015, and presented 6 Music's History of Video Game Music last year. Ted Lasso (Apple TV) After Schitt's Creek ended, I was desperately searching for a TV show that hit the same sweet spot of belly-laughs and heart-warming humour. This is that show. Starring Jason Sudeikis, it tells the story of an American Football coach who comes to London to oversee a fictional Premiership team, despite knowing nothing about football. Unbeknownst to him, the club's owner (played with delicious relish by Hannah Waddingham) is trying to get the team relegated to spite her adulterous husband. I won't spoil the plot, but the show's relentlessly optimistic tone is just what I needed in lockdown. Pikmin 3 Deluxe (Nintendo) Pikmin isn't as well-known as Nintendo's bigger franchises, like Mario and Zelda, but it's been made with just as much care and attention to detail. You play as a crew of astronauts, stranded on a hostile planet, who have to enlist a crop of plant-like creatures to help them find the missing parts of their spaceship. You command up to 100 of the little Pikmin, each of whom have different abilities (some are fighters, some are swimmers, others are impervious to electricity) to solve a bunch of increasingly tricky puzzles against a time limit. It's simultaneously relaxing and panic-inducing; but I've been focusing on completing the less stressful challenge mode with my 10-year-old, who just likes throwing the Pikmin around and laughing at their cute noises. Dua Lipa - Future Nostalgia (Warner Music) Rush-released at the start of the first lockdown, this is still my favourite record of the year. A sweat-glistened hymn to the dancefloor, it never fails to lift my mood. The album is getting the live treatment later this month, with a virtual gig that's been dubbed Studio 2054 - with Dua promising (deep breath) ""a kaledioscopic, rocket-fuelled, journey through time, space, mirrorballs, roller discos, bucket hats, belting beats, throbbing basslines and an absolute slam-dunk of the best times in global club culture"". See you there. Hotpants optional. The BBC Radio 3 broadcaster presents late-night show Unclassified, which showcases music by composers who might have a classical background but also draw from pop, rock, jazz, and experimental music. Ms Ice Sandwich by Mieko Kawakami (Pushkin Press) The Japanese author's novella is evocative but breezy, conversational and unsentimental. She's dealing with the difficulties and complexity of human life but in a really relatable, warm and humorous way. It's about the relationship between an adolescent and their mother. It's a coming-of-age tale and about the anxieties of being a teenager, but you get to see it from both sides. You can sense what the mother's feeling as well. She's a fortune teller and their grandma's ill upstairs. It's a family tale about female identity in Japan. Fat Out Fest (YouTube) The annual music festival from Salford-based underground and alternative promoters, Fat Out Fest happened live online this year, and they are now putting sets on YouTube every Friday over the next month. They really do take it to the edge. On 20 November they're broadcasting Lone Taxidermist - her shows are wild. It's performance art as well as music. Her new show Marra starts with her singing along to a cattle market. An actual cattle market. Her voice is synced with the auctioneer and Maxine Peake is in the video. It's out there. Radiophrenia (Streaming) Radiophrenia is a Glasgow sound art radio station that's streaming 24/7 until 22 November. I was listening to an Italian sound artist called Tobia Bandini. He'd interviewed all these people asking for their response to the apocalypse and then he'd mix their stories - they're all in Italian - with electronic soundscapes. If you want to tune out of the news then this is a really nice place to escape to. There's all sorts in there, and a lot of it is just really pleasing and quite hypnotic. The 1Xtra broadcaster started hosting its Drivetime show at the end of September, having joined the station in 2016. Billions (Sky, Amazon Prime) During lockdown I have started an obsession with the TV series Billions already watching three seasons! I think throughout the first lockdown, many of us found new interests and hobbies - for me one of those was trying to learn more about stocks. Billions is pretty much the ideal programme for being more of a nerd around finance! The Philosopher's Zone (podcast) I also found an amazing podcast called The Philosopher's Zone. With some thinking time during this lockdown, this podcast is perfect for that. It covers so many different past philosophers as well as different debate topics. It's really nice to just put it on play and binge listen. Aspire (William Morrow) I've started reading Aspire by Kevin Hall - an incredible read! It's very self-helpy (which is very me) but it's such a great read, it focuses on the power of words and how they make a real impact in our lives. I don't think I've sold that book well, but trust me on this one, haha! Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

"The 1623 book, published seven years after the Bard's death, was the first collected edition of his plays. About 235 copies of the book exist, but only a handful of complete versions are known to be in private hands. The edition sold on Wednesday was the first complete copy to go under the hammer since 2001, when one fetched $6.1m (£4.9m) - the previous record. It was sold by Mills College in Oakland, California - a private college that has owned it since the 1960s. The identity of the buyer was not immediately known. Auction house Christie's had conservatively estimated its value at between $4m-$6m. The First Folio brought together 36 plays, 18 of which would otherwise not have been recorded. Without its publication there would be no copy of such plays as Macbeth, Twelfth Night, Julius Caesar and The Tempest. Most of the 235 copies known to exist are incomplete. One, owned by Oxford University, sold for £3.5m in 2003. Five or six complete versions are believed to be in private hands. Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

"""It's part of the story,"" she told the BBC's Will Gompertz. ""To omit it would have been whitewashing history."" Yet Bigelow insisted her movie does not suggest the al-Qaeda leader would not have been located without so-called ""enhanced interrogation techniques"". ""That's a misrepresentation of the film,"" said the Hurt Locker film-maker. Zero Dark Thirty has drawn criticism from within the US government with some senators complaining it perpetuates ""the myth that torture is effective"". However, the film, she said, shows ""a pretty wide array of tactics"" being used over the 10 years it took to identify Bin Laden's hiding place. The terrorist was eventually tracked down to a compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, the storming of which by US Navy Seals in May 2011 forms the climax of Bigelow's drama. The raid, she said, was ""an incredibly diligent, incredibly complex and successful operation that brought the world's most dangerous man to justice"". The film, which Bigelow describes as ""a portrait of dedication, determination, commitment and sacrifice"", is released in the UK and Ireland on 25 January. On Sunday, Jessica Chastain was named best actress in a drama at the Golden Globes for her portrayal of the CIA agent orchestrating the manhunt. Chastain will also be up for best actress at the Oscars, one of five nominations the film has received from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Yet Bigelow - who won a best director Oscar in 2010 for The Hurt Locker, a portrait of bomb disposal experts in Iraq - is not in contention for the same honour for her follow-up film. It has been suggested that the controversy the film has provoked in the US may have damaged the film-maker's chances of further Oscar glory. Despite this, the 61-year-old said she ""wouldn't change the film at all"". ""I stand by it totally,"" she told the BBC's arts editor. More important than her film winning awards was that ""audiences are embracing it"". ""That's why you make a movie,"" she said. Bigelow described her film as ""an insight into a long, dark decade"" that began with the terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001. ""Our hope was to capture the essence of that decade and make a movie that stands the test of time."" Both she and screenwriter Mark Boal regard Zero Dark Thirty - named after a military term for half past midnight - as ""a first draft of history"". ""Hopefully the story will continue to be debated,"" she continued. ""My hope is there'll be many more renderings of this story.""","Director Kathryn Bigelow has defended the depiction of torture in her latest film Zero Dark Thirty, a dramatisation of the hunt for Osama Bin Laden."
"By Ian YoungsArts & entertainment reporter When La La Land's name was read out as the winner of the prize for best picture, that seemed to confirm this year's Oscars as being even more predictable and unmemorable than usual. But two minutes 22 seconds later, all hell broke loose. Later, in the Oscars press room, I asked the official Academy Awards historian, who knows everything there is to know about the Oscars and is on hand to answer journalists' questions, if anything like this had ever happened before. Her eyes glanced down, a sheepish look came over her face, and she replied: ""Not that I know of."" This just does not happen. This is the Oscars. And this is best picture - the final and most prestigious prize of the night. But it has happened - they announced the wrong winner, and 2017 now has an indelible place in Oscars history. Until that point, the biggest upset was Hacksaw Ridge beating La La Land to the award for best film editing. That's how exciting it was. But La La Land was hot favourite to win best picture, so no-one was surprised when its name was read out. Its producers were midway through their well-polished acceptance speeches when hell began to break loose. Perhaps it was worth the mistake to hear La La producer Jordan Horowitz's line, delivered during that heady two minutes 22 seconds: ""There's a lot of love in this room, and let's use it to create and champion bold and diverse work - work that inspires us towards joy, towards hope and towards empathy."" He could have been referring to Moonlight. And when he was told of the mix-up shortly afterwards, his quick and uncomplaining concession to Moonlight was admirable. ""I'm going to be really proud to hand this to my friends from Moonlight,"" he said before embracing that film's incredulous crew and relinquishing the golden statuette. Every time the TV cameras cut away to a celebrity in the audience, each was wearing the same look - astonishment and disbelief. Unbelievable. La La Land's leading lady Emma Stone was also gracious after defeat was snatched from the jaws of victory - although winning best actress probably softened the blow. In the press room, she seemed unperturbed by the turn of events. ""God I love Moonlight so much,"" she said. ""I'm so excited for Moonlight. Of course it was an amazing thing to hear La La Land, and I would love to win best picture. ""But we are so excited for Moonlight. I think it is one of the best films of all time."" Let's hope, in that case, that Moonlight isn't just remembered as that film that won in that year the Oscars messed up and spoiled La La Land's party. It is a worthy winner, and deserves to be remembered as a beautiful, tender, touching, clever, bold work of art. And let's hope, for that matter, that this fiasco is not forever attached to the memory of La La Land. It would have been a worthy winner too - it is an audacious, magical, transporting cinematic achievement. And the fact that the directors of both films are in their 30s, and have been recognised as major new talents during this awards season, bodes well for future Oscar years. Perhaps there will be a rematch. The commotion also overshadowed the rest of the night's winners, who may have been largely predictable but were no less deserving. Viola Davis and Mahershala Ali were hugely popular best supporting actress and actor victors respectively, and delivered powerful personal speeches. The closest acting race was for best actor - where Casey Affleck triumphed over Denzel Washington, meaning history wasn't made by giving three of the four acting trophies to black stars. However, two African-American winners is a welcome result after two years of #OscarsSoWhite. As well as diversity, the other issue that was supposed to dominate the show was politics. This was meant to be the year when Hollywood railed against Donald Trump. And there were references to the current political turmoil. Presenting one award, Mexican actor Gael Garcia Bernal said: ""I'm against any sort of wall that wants to separate us."" Moonlight's Barry Jenkins indirectly referred to the president, telling those who feel underrepresented: ""For the next four years, we will not leave you alone, we will not forget you."" And ceremony host Jimmy Kimmel touched on the topic throughout the night - in a flippant way. Absent winner's message The main political statement came when Iranian director Asghar Farhadi won best foreign language film - but was not there to collect the award because he stayed away in protest at Mr Trump's attempted travel ban. Instead, he sent a message saying: ""Dividing the world into the us and our enemies categories creates fear. A deceitful justification for aggression and war."" The four acting winners completely steered clear of overtly political statements. ""Man, I wish I had something bigger and more meaningful to say,"" best actor winner Casey Affleck said from the podium. Which is funny because he did have something bigger and more meaningful to say when he won an Independent Spirit Award just a day earlier. At that ceremony, he said: ""The policies of this administration are abhorrent and they will not last. They're really un-American."" 'It's going to be history' So did the actors and actresses chicken out of talking about politics at the Oscars? Or did they realise that preaching would have done little to change minds and would have just alienated half of the country? Affleck told the BBC backstage: ""Personally, I didn't say anything because my head was completely blank, [because of] the shock of winning the award and the terror of having a microphone in front of you and all of those faces staring at you."" So it won't be remembered as the political Oscars after all. But at least it will be remembered. ""Is that the craziest Oscar moment of all time?"" Emma Stone said of the best picture debacle. Pause. ""Cool! It's going to be history."" Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

"The 63-year-old actress said: ""The idea of that just so made me happy. But they were like, 'Um, no.'"" Jodie Whittaker eventually became the first female (and 13th overall) Doctor in 2018. Goldberg, who was yesterday announced as one of the category presenters at the Oscars, said she was a big sci-fi fan and has always loved sci-fi shows. Speaking on David Tennant's podcast, she said: ""I always felt like science fiction predicted the future. ""Whether it was climate change, hand computers or being able to move around in different dimensions."" Tennant himself played the Doctor from 2005 to 2010. Goldberg, who has starred in films like Sister Act and Ghost, also lived out her sci-fi dreams as Guinan on Star Trek: The Next Generation. She told the Radio Times in 2017 that she wanted to star in Doctor Who and was hoping someone would offer her a cameo. ""I always hope when I come to England the BBC will say, 'Hey we want you to do something.' I would love that"", she told The Sun, while speaking about her love of British TV. ""You have a different quality now on television. The way you guys have always done shows has always been the smartest and we've finally just figured it out.

"By Michael OsbornEntertainment reporter, BBC News But long before her stature on the small screen soared, Cilla was an unknown Liverpool lass with an astonishing rags to riches story. Her early years are about to be relived in a new TV drama charting how Priscilla White was transformed into a chart-topping singing star. It also chronicles the turbulent highs and lows from tasting fame to finding lasting love. The three-part offering - simply called Cilla - presents actress Sheridan Smith with the onerous task of portraying the young woman who went on to become a national treasure. We see her in early 1960s Liverpool, a grim city riven by religious prejudices where prospects were limited. Young people - including Cilla - escaped everyday life by going to see exciting new rock and roll bands at the Cavern Club. Screenwriter Jeff Pope, who also co-scripted Oscar-nominated film Philomena, says the drama is ""a non-patronising look at the working class"". ""I thought the earlier part of Cilla's life would be interesting. We live in the X Factor age and I thought it was intriguing to see how Cilla had come up from literally nowhere and how she made it,"" he adds. ""But at its heart is a love story between Cilla and Bobby - and Cilla and Brian."" The singer's rise in the drama is dominated by two men - Bobby, who went on to be the love of her life and was ""very happy to carry the handbag"" for such a successful woman, and music mogul Brian Epstein, who plucked Black from obscurity. He died of an overdose in 1967 aged 34, and a side story of the TV mini-series is his tortured existence as a closeted gay man in the dark days before homosexuality was decriminalised in the year of his death. West End performer Smith, whose collaboration with Pope on drama Mrs Biggs won her a Bafta, says the drama will bring the two halves of Cilla's career together. ""The younger generation who have got no clue about this and know about Blind Date will get to see this amazing singing career, and the older generation can relive it."" The actress not only had to capture the essence of a youthful Cilla in her portrayal, but had to sing live for scenes from the frenetic buzz of the Cavern Club as 'Swinging Cilla' to the recording studios of Abbey Road. ""In the months leading up to shooting, I had every interview, every piece of footage from the early 60s and there was loads on YouTube so I sat there watching them,"" explains Smith. ""There's only one Cilla and everyone does an impression of her. I didn't want to do her a disservice and I'm not an impersonator. I wanted to try to get little mannerisms like the way she touched her hair. ""I had some singing lessons - I sing with my mouth wide open, she sings with it quite closed. I know I don't have her voice,"" she adds, pointing out that Cilla had a ""honk"" as well as much softer vocals. The actress recounts how her role led to a dinner date with the star which made the weight of her burden become real. ""I was really star-struck and nervous and I babbled away at her. It's a huge responsibility and you don't want to let them down. ""She gave me her phone number but I was too shy to ring! What do you ask?!"" adds Smith. ""And I have no plans to make an album of covers - come on, there's only one Cilla!"" But she plays down the performance, saying it was all down to a simple prop synonymous with Cilla. ""I just had to whack my teeth in and I was away! They changed the shape of my mouth so it really helped with the accent."" Pope, whose credits also include Fred West dramatisation Appropriate Adult and The Widower, says Cilla had an important role in creating the drama - and encouraged him to tease out the spikier side of her growth as a star. The story clearly shows how she could be tough with those around her and was even a match for established artists like songwriter Burt Bacharach. ""She was very insistent that we go into areas that weren't viewed through rose-coloured spectacles. She was very upfront about how determined she was and how sharp her elbows were and had to be in those days. ""Would her tendency be, like her TV shows, to smooth everything out and present a wonderful face to the world? I found the opposite,"" he says. ""She was in a man's world and I admire her strength,"" adds Smith. The writer said watching the films with a figure who remains alive and well was ""stressful"", not to mention filled with memories. ""Cilla made a joke out of it and said 'this normally happens when someone kicks the bucket.' The emotion of seeing the love of her life [who died in 1999] was massive."" Cilla's story finishes before her marriage to Bobby in 1969 and after the peak of her musical fame. Tellingly, a contract for a BBC television show is found beside the body of Epstein, hinting at the beginnings of a small screen star we all know and love. Cilla begins on ITV on Monday 15 September at 2100 BST.","Popular entertainer Cilla Black became best known for her huge television hits Blind Date and Surprise Surprise, which dominated the airwaves in the 1980s and 90s."
"By Mark SavageBBC Music reporter Born Jahseh Dwayne Onfroy in south Florida, he had a troubled upbringing that was often punctuated by violence. His mother was a teenager when he was born and flitted in and out of his life. He was raised by his grandmother, family friends and babysitters - and once said he used violence to make his mother pay attention. ""I used to beat kids at school just to get her to talk to me, yell at me,"" he said. Despite that, he was fiercely protective of their relationship, once claiming that when he was six years old he ""bit [the] flesh out"" of a man who laid his hands on her. He was later expelled from middle school for fighting, but he soon channelled his energy and fury into music. The 20-year-old became the most popular artist in the genre known as SoundCloud Rap, defined by its languid, hazy beats and wide-ranging influences - comprising everything from hardcore hip-hop to grunge and indie. From the outset XXXTentacion's songs were visceral and abrupt. His breakout single Look At Me! sounded like it was being played through a smashed-up phone speaker - but he was also capable of disarming fragility and tenderness. On his debut album, 17, he talked sensitively about depression and mental anguish, largely forsaking hip-hop beats for acoustic guitars and smudged, sullen melodies. Rapper Kendrick Lamar was one of many high-profile supporters, tweeting ""listen to this album if you feel anything. raw thoughts"" - and the record peaked at number two on the US charts. His surging popularity was noted by the music industry and, by October 2017, he had scored a distribution agreement reportedly worth $6 million (£4.5m) between his own record label and Caroline Records, which also represents Van Morrison and Chrissie Hynde. But the teenager's career was already being overshadowed by his violent behaviour, including charges of aggravated battery of a pregnant woman, domestic battery by strangulation and, later, witness tampering. The accusations, which Pitchfork explained in harrowing detail last year, suggest a pattern of routine abuse that would have resulted in a substantial prison sentence, had the case gone to trial. Onfroy pleaded not guilty and laughed off the allegations in a profanity-strewn tirade on social media, calling the charges ""fabricated"" and pledging to donate $100,000 to domestic violence-prevention programmes (it is unclear whether the payment ever materialised). He also continued to court controversy, releasing a provocative music video earlier this year in which, to make a point about racism, he put a noose around the neck of a young white child. He later gave an interview in which he argued against feminism. Fans were apparently unswayed by - or attracted to - the star's tribulations; sending his latest album ? to number one in the US. The album also produced his only UK hit, a desolate heartbreak song called SAD. The star's manager reflected that Onfroy's volatile life was what made his music so compelling. ""He's just a young kid that was lost and needed a chance in life,"" Solomon Sobande told Billboard magazine last year. ""So much stuff around him touched my heart.

"By Emma SaundersEntertainment reporter But there's trouble in the camp following Ant's recent arrest on suspicion of drink driving, after he was involved in a collision in south-west London on Sunday. He also spent a period in rehab last summer for painkiller and alcohol addiction. And now it's uncertain what the future holds. We look at the implications for the much-loved pair and ITV as Ant seeks further treatment. What will happen to future shows? This week's Saturday Night Takeaway has been cancelled. The following two programmes in the series, due to be broadcast on 31 March and 7 April - will be presented by Dec on his own, ITV announced on Tuesday. It's the first time he'll have presented without Ant. Audition episodes of the upcoming series of Britain's Got Talent have already been filmed, but The Sun reported on Tuesday that Ant will not front the live shows alongside Dec in May. The next series of the third show they jointly host, I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!, isn't due to air until November. Ant's publicist said on Monday that his client was taking time off ""for the foreseeable future"" and would have further treatment. What's the reaction been like? There's been a mixed reaction from both the public and fellow celebs following Ant's arrest. While there is evidently sympathy for the star, many have tempered their support with warnings about drink driving. On ITV's This Morning, Holly Willoughby and Philip Schofield addressed the issue saying: ""This is difficult for us, we're talking about a friend here… like many people we are shocked and saddened by Sunday's incident. ""We want to wish those shaken and upset by the collision a quick recovery and personally for Ant we hope he gets some time and space to return to full health."" Piers Morgan also spoke about the situation on Good Morning Britain, saying: ""Dec's collateral damage. Dec's done nothing wrong. Ant is in control of his own behaviour and is making bad choices. ""I've known Ant a long time, I did Britain's Got Talent with him for four years - he's a great guy, a down-to-earth lad. ""He's definitely changed.... is he surrounded by people protecting the cash cow or surrounded by people who genuinely have his best interests at heart? This Ant McPartlin is not the guy I know."" What could this mean for Ant's career? Entertainment commentator Caroline Frost says the situation is becoming more critical. ""Even by the standards of his already tumultuous year, this latest incident has far more serious implications for Ant's career than anything previously,"" she told the BBC. ""While his self-admitted battle with prescription drugs and other substances elicited a sympathetic response from his many fans, a drink-driving arrest has already garnered a far more mixed response. ""The brand of Ant and Dec - cheeky chappies, boys next door - relies on wholesomeness and reliability, and both of those aspects of their singular appeal have taken a huge battering."" Nevertheless, Ant is one of the UK's most popular stars and many people will be willing him to return to on our screens once he has made a full recovery. What does it mean for Dec? Caroline adds that Dec ""will be having as hard a time as anyone"". ""In many people's minds, Ant and Dec is one unit - they share awards, social media accounts, 'they' are a single offering. ""Their partnership is their superpower, and Dec will find it very hard to compete on primetime television with the yawning gap where his partner should be. Nor do I think he would want to try."" Strategic PR consultant Mark Borkowski agrees: ""Could Morecambe go on without Wise? They are a double act. Would Dec have the same impact? What would that say to his pal who's recovering (if Dec went on alone)? This is a very deep friendship that goes back to childhood."" Mark says there's a lot riding on Ant's recovery. ""It's incredibly difficult. They are proper A-list. It's not dissimilar to the problems with Jeremy Clarkson but look what happened when he overstepped the mark - you lost the potency of the format (the Top Gear line-up featuring Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond),"" he explains. ""Now it's about putting some context into these issues, trying to focus on his ill health."" But he cautions that there's much more at stake in the modern age. ""There are some real issues - the commercial pressures of putting people back on the screen. If someone says they're fit enough to go back on screen what are you going to do?"" What are the implications for ITV, financially and creatively? The channel certainly has some thinking to do after issuing a statement on Monday saying: ""We very much hope that he (Ant) gets the help that he needs."" Sponsors and advertisers could be considering their positions. Suzuki, who have a deal with Saturday Night Takeaway, have issued a statement. ""Suzuki GB PLC is aware of a statement issued by ITV. Suzuki will remain in dialogue with ITV and advise media when appropriate regarding the last two episodes of the series,"" it read. ""Ant and Dec helm not one but three of their very biggest shows, around which so much of ITV's schedule is built,"" says Caroline. ""While they will be crossing their fingers for Ant's healthy return, I would hope this is a lesson for all broadcasters not to put too many eggs in one basket in future."" Mark adds: ""I don't think two people have shouldered the commercial share price of ITV before. ""Ant and Dec are unique, the most valuable property going.""

"By Mark SavageBBC music reporter Price made history in 1933 when she became the first African-American woman to have a symphony performed by a major US orchestra, in Chicago. But her work faded into obscurity after her death in 1953. Much of it was thought to be lost, until a cache of music was found in her former summer house in Chicago in 2009. Musicologist Samantha Ege has spent the past two years trawling through those archives to reconstruct her solo piano pieces. Among them was Fantasie Nègre No 3 in F Minor, which was long presumed to be incomplete. 'Gathering dust' ""The music just ended after two pages really abruptly,"" Ege told the BBC. She made it her mission to find the missing pieces in Price's archive, which is now held in the University of Arkansas. The problem was that, while the piece starts in F minor, the second page ends in a different key - A♭ major. Using Price's previous compositions as a template, Ege assumed the Fantasie would return to the original key in its closing passages. ""I tried to imagine where the music could go,"" she said. ""But I didn't have a piano [in the archives] so I was really just trying to work it all out in my head."" The eureka moment came when Ege realised Price ""had more to say"" in the second key of A♭ major. She quickly found pages of manuscript that seemed match the first two sheets of Fantasie Nègre No 3 just ""gathering dust"" in a box on a shelf. She wasn't convinced of her breakthrough until she went home and tried the piece out on her piano. ""When I was playing through the music and it was under my fingers it just felt magical. It felt that history was coming to life,"" she told BBC arts correspondent Rebecca Jones. ""I sort of had chills thinking about the fact that I am hearing this music for the first time in this century."" Ege subsequently recorded the piece - the first time it has been committed to tape - for a new CD, Fantasie Nègre - The Piano Music of Florence Price. It was released on Monday, International Women's Day, alongside recordings of Price's other Fantasies and various ""sketches and snapshots"" that Ege found in the archive. ""Each one takes various ideas from a black folkloric musical tradition and blends [them] with the late 19th Century Romantic tradition,"" she said. ""The first Fantasy Nègre is based on a spiritual, Please Don't Let This Harvest Pass... and I think of each one as different chapters in a very elaborate novel. ""Even though they were never published during her lifetime, she wrote them down and noted that they were some of her most worthy compositions, and so it's really moving to be able to bring that together and perform them together."" Composer's story Ege's work is the latest chapter in the rediscovery and reappraisal of Price's work. She was born Florence Smith in 1887 in Little Rock, Arkansas, to a dentist father and piano teacher mother, who encouraged her to take up the instrument. She went on to study at the New England Conservatory of Music, one of the few music schools to accept black students at the time, and earned two diplomas in piano and organ. By 1910, she was head of the music department at Clark Atlanta University in Atlanta, Georgia. In 1912, she married Thomas J Price and they moved back to her home town - but racial tensions were on the rise and, after a public lynching in 1927, the family moved to Chicago. When her husband struggled to find work, the couple divorced, but Price retained her married name and made ends meet by teaching piano, playing the organ for silent film screenings and writing advertising jingles under the name Vee Jay. At the same time, she started entering composing competitions, winning several prizes. Her big break came in 1932, when her First Symphony won the orchestral category in the Wanamaker Music Composition Contest. That caught the attention of conductor Frederick Stock, who premiered the symphony with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra the following year. Despite that success, she often struggled to get her music played in a more sexist and segregated era. It was a problem she acknowledged in a 1943 letter to the music director of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, Serge Koussevitzky, asking him to consider performing her music. ""I have two handicaps,"" she wrote. ""I am a woman and I have some Negro blood in my veins."" She continued to write, and her music was performed in concert halls in Detroit, Michigan, and Brooklyn, New York. The contralto Marian Anderson also sang Price's arrangement of My Soul's Been Anchored in De Lord as the closing song of her historic concert at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC in 1939. After her death in 1953, Price's music was largely overlooked by the classical music establishment, but her reputation was preserved by black musicians and newspapers, which championed her legacy. The discovery of her archive in 2009 helped bring her music to wider audiences again, with BBC Radio 3 dedicating a five-part documentary to her story last year. Ege said there were many more works in Price's repertoire that remain to be recorded and publicised - and with the first festival dedicated to the composer due to take place later this year, she hopes her place in the classical music canon will be maintained. ""These pieces now need to be performed, and we need to hear them, so that we can we can appreciate Florence Price today, not just in terms of her history, but in terms of the works and the artistry that she created,"" she said.

"It has made more than $6.2bn (£3.8bn) in ticket sales alone, not counting merchandise, cast recordings or revenue from the film on which it is based. And that means it has overtaken The Phantom of the Opera, even though Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical has been seen by twice as many paying punters. The biggest film release at the box office, Avatar, has made almost $2.8bn. Featuring music by Sir Elton John, with lyrics written by Sir Tim Rice, The Lion King began on Broadway in 1997. It was based on a highly successful Disney animation released three years earlier. 'Deeply proud' Last year, it was the highest-grossing musical on the New York stage, and it retains its number one position so far in 2014. Its 22 productions around the world are thought to have been seen by 75 million people. Disney Theatrical Productions president Thomas Schumacher said: ""It's difficult not to become emotional at this realisation of the show's impact."" He added he was ""deeply proud"" of how the stage show had offered the same audience experience in numerous countries around the world. The producers of Phantom acknowledged being overtaken by The Lion King, calling it ""the pride of Broadway"". But Phantom, which started life on stage in 1986, remains the longest-running show in Broadway history and has been seen by an estimated 140 million people around the world. Ten productions of Phantom are currently running, including in London's West End, on Broadway and touring North America.

"The BBC's annual report revealed 16 individuals were paid more than £500,000 in the financial year 2011-12, three fewer than the year before. Meanwhile, director general Mark Thompson earned £622,000 in the past financial year - down from £779,000. He earned 15 times more than the median pay of a BBC employee. Thompson is stepping down from his role in September and will be succeeded by the BBC's current director of Vision, George Entwistle. He will be paid significantly less - £450,000 in his first year. In total, the combined salaries of the BBC's executive directors fell from £5,714,000 in 2010-11 to £2,560,000, largely due to the number of board members being reduced from 13 to seven. Two of the seven who stepped down are still on the BBC payroll - Lucy Adams, who is the corporation's head of business operations, and Peter Salmon, the director of BBC North. Lord Patten, chairman of the BBC Trust, said: ""We have continued to push hard on value for money, encouraging the BBC to drive down senior management pay and draw up a plan for living in more financially constrained times."" The annual report also looked at the BBC's productions. Spending on the BBC's TV channels decreased by £37.1m in 2011-12, down to £2.3bn. But radio spending increased by £2m to £640.1m. Drama output across BBC television fell by 156 hours, although there was a significant increase in drama on BBC radio - up 419 hours. But new British drama programming increased by 144 hours. Lord Patten said: ""One of our main priorities is ensuring the BBC produces genuinely distinctive programmes, and progress has been made here, although there is more to do."" Entertainment programmes increased by 327 hours, while the same genre also went up on radio by 568 hours. Factual content on TV increased by 307 hours, while music and arts fell by 90 hours. Televised sports decreased by 389 hours and there were 602 hours less of sports coverage on BBC radio. Staff numbers were reduced by 342. There were 470 senior managers in the BBC last year, a reduction of 70. The BBC also announced that it has exchanged contracts for the sale of Television Centre in west London to property developers Stanhope Plc for a total price of £200m. The BBC put Television Centre on sale in June 2011 and has operated on the site since 1960. The iconic building opened on 29 June 1960, as the BBC's first purpose-built centre for television production. Staff based there are now either based in Salford or are in the process of moving to the newly extended Broadcasting House in central London. The BBC's financial officer, Zarin Patel, said the BBC had a strong financial foundation. 'Explain better' The corporation has an underlying surplus of £249m, thanks to changes to the staff's pension scheme, which saved £45m, and the one-off sale of BBC Worldwide's magazines business for £95m. The BBC saved a total of £499m since 2008-09, exceeding the 3% target set by the BBC Trust. The corporation has a target of 11% in efficiency savings by 2016 as part of its Delivering Quality First strategy. A survey for the BBC Trust showed that 56% of UK adults agreed that their household received good value from the licence fee. The annual report stated that this figure had remained stable for the last four years ""but suggests that there is a need to better explain how the money is being spent"".

"By Sarah Jane GriffithsEntertainment reporter, BBC News The black-and-white animation pays homage to his favourite, classic horror movies, which Burton's parents say he was watching on TV ""before I could walk or talk"". It is also just in time for Halloween. But Burton says his intention has never been to make a frightening film. ""I don't think I've ever made any scary movie, ever, even if I've tried to. I've never made a scary movie,"" insists the director, whose visually stunning, darker-than-average films include Beetlejuice, Corpse Bride and the recent Dark Shadows. He also points out that serving up ""scary"" subject matter to children is nothing new. ""You know I grew up on Disney movies and I always thought that's what partly made Disney movies. From Snow White on, they've always dealt with some [scary] imagery. ""Those are the most memorable parts of the movie as far as I was concerned,"" says Burton. He was ""never afraid"" of the 1930s horror films such as Dracula and The Mummy but as a young boy growing up in Burbank, Los Angeles, who felt ""a little isolated"", he instead identified with the title characters. ""I just linked up the feeling with Frankenstein with the way I felt. The creature, and also the mad scientist. And my neighbours were the angry villagers,"" he explains. Childhood memories In true Burton style, Frankenweenie deals with death and darkness with a light touch. It tells the sweet story of young science buff Victor Frankenstein, who tries to bring his pet dog Sparky back to life. Burton based Victor on himself as a boy: ""On an emotional level anyway, obviously it's not real. ""I liked making little Super 8 films and I was a lacking sportsperson. [I] loved my dog,"" explains Burton. Sadly for the film-maker, his dog Pepe also died. But as well as loss and bereavement, the film also touches on issues of making friends and finding your way in life. ""I think a lot of kids feel like they're just sort of loners,"" explains Burton. ""But you also get along, you go to school. In fact I always felt like the other kids were much stranger than I was, which I tried to reflect a little bit in the film."" Victor's schoolmates, ranging from toothy misfit Edgar 'E' Gore to Boris Karloff lookalike Nassor and the wide-eyed Weird Girl with her fluffy cat Mr Whiskers, certainly seem to reflect Burton's views of his classmates. ""What was fun for me on this is to really delve back into the memory bank. We tried to base everything on a real actual person or memory or a combination of people. And then also how those [horror] movies kind of helped me through those years."" 'Powerful combination' Created by Burton and screenwriter John August, Frankenweenie's characters were brought to life as stop-motion puppets at Three Mills Studios in east London, with each animator painstakingly creating just a few seconds of footage in an average week. They were inspired by the original drawings Burton made while working at Disney in 1984. Burton chose to use stop-motion and black and white as they are a ""powerful combination"" for 3D technology which ""shows the artist's work more"". ""I just felt it was more emotional in black and white than in colour, and more real in a strange way,"" says Burton. As usual, Burton called on actors he could trust to voice the characters, from Edward Scissorhands star Winona Ryder, to Ed Wood's Martin Landau - who plays Victor's inspirational science teacher Mr Rzykruski. In fact both Catherine O'Hara (Beetlejuice and The Nightmare Before Christmas) and Martin Short (Mars Attacks!) voice three characters each. O'Hara - who met her husband on the set of Beetlejuice more than 20 years ago - voices Victor's mother Mrs Frankenstein, Weird Girl and the school's overbearing PE teacher. The director persuaded her to base the latter on an ""obnoxious"" woman on US TV. ""The monsters in Tim's life are these scary people who take themselves seriously, and are arrogant and oppress others,"" explains O'Hara. 'Risky business' Working with people ""who just believe in you and basically take a shot"" is also Burton's way of negotiating the business end of Hollywood, where ""everything is risky"". Despite having achieved box office success with films like Batman, he says each project can still be ""a struggle to mount"". So far critics have raved about Frankenweenie, which opened the London Film Festival last week. But Burton remains unsure of what the public's reaction will be, and is even primed for some ""initial resistance"". ""When I did my first couple of films, Pee Wee's Big Adventure or Beetlejuice, they were on the 10 worst movies of the year list! A few years later people change their minds."" Producer Allison Abbate - another longtime Burton collaborator - hopes parents will give it a shot, rather than assuming the animation is too dark. ""We've had parents say, 'I like this movie because I can talk to my kids about stuff'. It does seem like a pity if people can't find the movie because they think it might be too scary. ""But once kids see it and say 'I wasn't scared', more people will go and see it."" With such a personal project as Frankenweenie, the stakes are higher than usual for Burton. ""You're always worried, you always feel a bit exposed. I get quite vulnerable and actually depressed."" Burton continues: ""I never know. Every movie I've ever done could go either way. ""I've heard 10-year old girls say they love Sweeney Todd. On other movies people say, 'When one of your films comes on, my dogs love watching it'!"" Frankenweenie is released in UK cinemas on 17 October.","Nearly 30 years after Disney fired Tim Burton because his short film Frankenweenie was ""too scary"" for children, the director - who has made a feature length, 3D stop-motion version of the story - insists he has ""never made a scary movie""."

"Will GompertzArts editor@WillGompertzBBCon Twitter But there are handful of people who have taken to podcasting like Luke Skywalker to a lightsaber and become masters of cyberspace broadcasting. Elizabeth Day has gone from journalist to novelist to prominent media figure with her How To Fail podcast. George The Poet has cut through with his meditative musings, while the footballer Peter Crouch has turned into a surprise comedy star with his laddish tales from the locker-room. In America - where the art of podcasting was honed with shows like Serial, This American Life and Radiolab - the medium has long had a seat at the top table of the entertainment business. As was made evident this week with the announcement that the Swedish streaming service Spotify had paid a huge sum of money - the Wall Street Journal reported the deal could be worth around $100 million (£82 million) - for exclusive rights to a Californian-based podcast called The Joe Rogan Experience. Joe Rogan is a famous personality in the US. He first made his name as a stand-up comic, then turned to acting, before hosting a TV show featuring wince-inducing dares, and between all this established himself as a respected mixed martial arts UFC commentator. He started his eponymous podcast in 2009 as a ""mates chatting"" sort of thing, which it basically still is, although some of his mates are now Senators and Harvard professors. Anyway, it works: the show is said to have over 190 million monthly downloads, which is a lot of listeners by any measure (it is also available for free on YouTube, for now). I visited his website to hear what all the fuss was about, and chose episode #1470 from a couple of weeks ago, in which Rogan chats to Elon Musk, the tech entrepreneur and Tesla car boss. He'd had Musk on the show before, offered him a puff on his joint (cannabis is legal in the state where the show is made), which Elon duly accepted, leading to headlines and a sharp drop in Tesla's share price. The episode I listened to didn't have any such incidents. The two men began by chewing the fat about Musk's newly-born baby, to whom the businessman and his partner had given a name that sounded like a line of code written by one of his company's boffs. Rogan was amused and enthusiastic as the conversation gently meandered towards the topic of connecting computers to our brains, a concept that appeared to enthral and appal the host in equal measure. Not so the quietly-spoken Musk, who considered the prospect of a ""whole brain interface"" where ""more of you would be in the cloud than in your body"", to be viable within decades. Don't worry if that seems like too long to wait, because he also thought if all went to plan, that in five years we won't have to talk anymore because we'll be able to communicate our unfettered thoughts through neural links. These were not small things to posit given the obvious ramifications, particularly for The Joe Rogan Experience: no talking, no podcast. But our host didn't seem concerned or particularly interested in interrogating the breezy claims his guest made with a matter-of-factness that equated to someone putting a live grenade in your hand and mentioning, by-the-by, it could be quite dangerous. That's not to say Rogan was disengaged. It's just that his natural curiosity tended to stop at wow without getting to why. Which is fine, that's the nature of the show: guests are allowed to talk as much and as long as they like, often for hours, with Rogan the interlocutor playing the role of everyman: a part he has nailed better than almost anyone else in the world of podcasts, if one was judging by numbers alone (downloads, YouTube views, Instagram followers etc.). He is, as they say nowadays, relatable. His listeners get him, like him; maybe even want to be him. He's not a show-pony, or a light-entertainment phoney: he's the all-American do it yourself modern man, tough but intelligent. Joe Rogan is the Bruce Springsteen of chat. The Boss has taken his brand global, whether Rogan can repeat the feat in the talk-show genre will be interesting to see. The two men have much in common. They share the same muscular male aesthetic, with a love of T-shirts and no BS. They're both from New Jersey. They both had troubled relationships with their fathers - Springsteen's dad was a bus driver, Rogan's a cop. And they both found fame as the front man on stage. Given the size of its investment, Spotify must be hoping Rogan can compete with Springsteen in terms of reach and appeal. I'm not so sure he can having listened to his show. Songs can be reinterpreted, meaning can morph and be personalised - less so with chat, which tends to be specific to the host and his or her culture. I quite enjoyed listening to his conversation with Musk, but I wouldn't download another show in a rush for entertainment's sake. It wasn't just because the entrepreneur could say almost anything without being challenged - there's a section about Covid-19 when I found my eyebrows rise while Joe's and Elon's were furrowed in agreement (I believe in previous episodes Rogan has been more sceptical). The main problem is my cultural reference points are different, I don't relate to Joe Rogan. I'm not interested in mixed martial arts or conspiracy theories or smoking weed or drinking hard liquor or camping or ""dumb things"". I don't care if a Tesla car can accelerate to 60 mph in under two seconds or want to hear what Elon Musk has to say to ""all the fools out there"" - another throwaway remark that went unchallenged. Nevertheless, the host clearly reflects the views and tastes of a vast number of American people, and has developed a format with which they can connect and hear his thoughts and those of his guests (male-skewed, judging by the recent roster). And that's why I will continue to download his show: Not to be amused but to be informed. Listen to The Joe Rogan Experience and you hear America.

"By Mark SavageBBC Music reporter The summer smash actually increased its sales week-on-week, despite Drake's new album, Scorpion, dominating streaming services over the past seven days. However, the Canadian star scored three new entries in the top five, led by the Michael Jackson collaboration Don't Matter To Me at number two. Scorpion also entered the album charts at number one, selling 64,000 copies. Each of Scorpion's 25 tracks would have featured in the top 75 but for a rule that excludes all but the three most popular songs from the chart. The rule was enacted last year after Ed Sheeran's album ÷ [Divide] proved so popular it propelled 16 tracks into the top 20. In this case, it led to the odd situation where Drake's former number one single Nice For What disappeared from the chart altogether, despite being at number 24 last week. Elsewhere, the chart saw the return of the 1996 England football anthem Three Lions, which jumped 18 places to 24 after the team's World Cup victory over Colombia. The song saw a massive spike in downloads and streams - with 450,000 plays on Spotify alone on Tuesday - but due to a chart formula that deliberately disadvantages older songs, those plays translated to about 1,500 sales. This week also saw official video streams included in the singles chart for the first time. Maroon 5 and Cardi B's Girls Like You was the week's most popular video, with 2.67 million streams, helping to push it into the top 10 for the first time. On the album chart, Drake's success denied Florence + The Machine a fourth number one album, with her new release High As Hope debuting at number two. That meant The Greatest Showman soundtrack, which has spent a total of 21 weeks at number one, moved down to number three. There were new entries for Gorillaz' latest The Now Now at number five, David Bowie's live album Welcome To The Blackout at 16, and cult pop act Let's Eat Grandma, whose critically-acclaimed record I'm All Ears debuted at 28. Meanwhile, John Coltrane's posthumous record Both Directions at Once - The Lost Album charted at 15, becoming the jazz legend's first ever top 20 album. Official Charts Company chief executive Martin Talbot said: ""It is quite remarkable that it has taken until 2018 for John Coltrane to register a chart hit album - and says everything about the British public's love for classic, timeless jazz.""

"The 61-year-old triumphed in the BBC One show's first all-female final. For the final three-course challenge, she cooked red mullet with a squid risotto, griddled rosemary lamb chops and a fig and hazelnut baklava. Irini, who took inspiration from her Greek childhood, grew up in Crete and now lives in Cartmel, Cumbria. She was one of 56 amateur chefs who competed for the coveted MasterChef trophy in the show's 15th series. Over the course of several gruelling rounds of cooking challenges, they were whittled down to the final three. Irini was particularly pleased to have been in the show's first all-female final and said she wished she could have shared her trophy with her fellow finalists Jilly McCord and Delia Maria Asser. She said: ""It happened so quickly that I felt all the final that the three of us were like one. ""We were all doing our own thing, but actually we were in unison - so my instinctive reaction was: 'Can I share it? Can I share it with my friends?'"" Irini continued: ""We are just lucky we are three women who love and respect each other and have grown to be very fond and appreciative of each other's talents."" Irini said being filmed throughout the series did not bother her because she remained ""totally focused"". In an interview on BBC Breakfast, she said: ""The cameras didn't disturb me because you really need to ignore them if you want to cook. ""And the guys are fantastic, Gregg [Wallace] comes and relaxes you - he used to joke with me about Greek history, challenge me, laugh with me - and then John [Torode] is like a younger brother who cares for you, he wants you to do as well as you want to. ""They didn't bother me at all. In fact, I loved being around them."" Past winners of the show, such as 2005 champion Thomasina Miers and 2011's Shelina Permalloo, have gone on to own their own restaurants. But despite impressing some of the biggest names in the food industry throughout the competition, Irini's future plans do not involve opening her own professional kitchen. ""I don't think that at my time of life I want to run a restaurant,"" she said.

"By Mark SavageBBC Music reporter After The Cranberries' debut album, people thought they had the band sussed out. The Limerick band were part of the Celtic rock tradition, their shimmering, sorrowful ballads brought to life by Dolores O'Riordan's bell-clear vocals. Zombie shattered that illusion. A seething condemnation of the IRA, it was backed by pummelling, distorted guitars while O'Riordan's lilt was contorted into a primal howl: ""What's in your head Zombie? Zomb-ie-ey, ay-ey, ay-ey, aooowwwww."" Her pain was real: Zombie was a visceral response to the death of two children in an IRA bombing in the Cheshire town of Warrington. Three-year-old Johnathan Ball was killed when two bombs hidden in litter bins detonated on a busy shopping street in March 1993. Tim Parry, aged 12, died five days later. O'Riordan, who was on tour at the time, found herself deeply affected by the tragedy. ""I remember seeing one of the mothers on television, just devastated,"" she told Vox magazine in 1994. ""I felt so sad for her, that she'd carried him for nine months, been through all the morning sickness, the whole thing and some… prick, some airhead who thought he was making a point, did that."" The singer was particularly offended that terrorists claimed to have carried out these acts in the name of Ireland. ""The IRA are not me. I'm not the IRA,"" she said. ""The Cranberries are not the IRA. My family are not. ""When it says in the song, 'It's not me, it's not my family,' that's what I'm saying. It's not Ireland, it's some idiots living in the past."" Her anger and frustration poured into the song - which she wrote alone in her flat in Limerick on an acoustic guitar, before toughening it up in rehearsals. ""I picked up the electric guitar. Then I kicked in distortion on the chorus, and I said to Ferg [Fergal Lawler, drummer]: 'Maybe you could beat the drums pretty hard?'"" she told Team Rock last year. ""Even though it was written on an acoustic, it became a bit of a rocker."" The heavier sound was the ""right thing"" for the song, said guitarist Noel Hogan. ""If it was soft, it wouldn't have that impact,"" he told Holland's FaceCulture in 2012. ""This was a new direction for us. And it would stand out in the set because of that."" Released in September 1994, Zombie went on to become the band's biggest-selling single, reaching number one in Germany, Australia and France; and topping the US alternative rock charts. O'Riordan's lyrics received some criticism at the time. People called her naive and accused her of taking sides in a conflict she didn't understand. ""I don't care whether it's Protestant or Catholic, I care about the fact that innocent people are being harmed,"" she told Vox. ""That's what provoked me to write the song. ""It was nothing to do with writing a song about it because I'm Irish. You know, I never thought I'd write something like this in a million years. I used to think I'd get into trouble."" Instead, the song became an anthem for innocents trapped by other people's violence. In the 1990s, O'Riordan would regularly dedicate it to the citizens of Bosnia and Rwanda; and her message applies equally to recent attacks in Manchester, Paris and Egypt, to name just three. ""It doesn't name terrorist groups or organisations,"" she told the NME in 1994. ""It doesn't take sides. It's a very human song. ""To me, the whole thing [terrorism] is very confused. If these adults have a problem with these other adults well then, go and fight them. Have a bit of balls about it at least, you know?"" BBC ban In the UK, the song reached number 14 in the charts - its success perhaps hampered by the BBC's decision to ban the video. The original was shot by Samuel Bayer, who had previously directed the videos for Nirvana's Smells Like Teen Spirit and Blind Melon's No Rain. He travelled to Northern Ireland and shot footage of the troubles, including images of children holding guns, which the BBC (and Ireland's national broadcaster RTE) objected to. Instead, they broadcast an edited version focusing on performance footage, which the band disowned. ""We said it was crap but knew we were fighting a losing battle,"" Hogan told New Zealand magazine Rip It Up in 1995. ""It's just really stupid."" The official version of the video endured, though. It has been watched more than 660 million times on YouTube - making it the site's 210th most-popular video of all time. The song also remained a highlight of The Cranberries' concerts, regularly acting as the closing number of the set. The band recorded an acoustic, stripped-down version for last year's Something Else album. There's also a 1995 Eurodance cover version (awful, naturally), while Eminem sampled the song on his latest album. US metal band Bad Wolves had also been due to re-record the song with O'Riordan this week but the singer was found dead in her hotel room hours before the session was due to take place. ""We are devastated,"" said The Cranberries in a brief statement. ""She was an extraordinary talent and we feel very privileged to have been part of her life. The world has lost a true artist today."" The father Tim Parry also paid tribute, after learning for the first time that Zombie had been inspired by his son. ""The words are both majestic and also very real,"" he told BBC Radio Ulster. ""To read the words written by an Irish band in such compelling way was very, very powerful."" And perhaps that message of defiance and solidarity will be O'Riordan's legacy. ""If you feel really strongly about something and it really annoys you, then other young people will think the same as you and something can be done about it,"" she once told the NME. ""But first, you have to be aware."" Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

"By Mark SavageBBC music reporter The company says Triller has ""shamefully withheld payments owed to our artists"" and refused to negotiate a licence to use the music legitimately. Triller is a fast-growing rival to TikTok, and allows its users to create short videos, often set to music. The LA-based company ""categorically"" denied it had been withholding money. War of words Universal's move appears to means that world-renowned artists like Rihanna, Billie Eilish, Selena Gomez, Lady Gaga, Jay-Z and Bob Marley will no longer appear on Triller's videos. ""We will not work with platforms that do not value artists,"" said Universal in a statement. ""Triller has shamefully withheld payments owed to our artists and refuses to negotiate a licence going forward. We have no alternative except to remove our music from Triller, effective immediately."" However, the social media site responded with a strongly-worded statement disputing the Universal Music Group's (UMG's) claims. ""We can confirm our deal with UMG expired approximately one week ago. We have been negotiating since then in an attempt to renew,"" a spokesperson said. They went on to describe those negotiations as a ""formality"" and accused Universal of using its artists as ""leverage"" to extract ""ridiculous and non-sustainable payments for themselves and not their artists"". ""Triller does not need a deal with UMG to continue operating as it has been since the relevant artists are already shareholders or partners on Triller, and thus can authorise their usage directly,"" the statement continued. It is unclear how many UMG artists have individual deals with Triller. Past criticism The social media app received a rush of publicity last year when the US threatened to ban TikTok, citing national security concerns. Many of TikTok's biggest creators, including Charli D'Amelio and Noah Beck, created Triller accounts, and the app briefly topped the charts in Apple's App Store. The platform, which actually pre-dates TikTok, has been criticised for its failure to pay musicians before. Last year, the head of the US National Music Publishers' Association said Triller ""boasts 'millions of songs at your fingertips', however many of those songs have not been properly licensed.

"The show, broadcast on Fox Network, has faced years of criticism over white actor Hank Azaria's voiceover of Indian-American character Apu. Mr Azaria said earlier this year that he was stepping down from the role. The entertainment industry has come under growing pressure to provide more opportunities for non-white performers. Friday's announcement comes in the wake of the Black Lives Matter protests, which were sparked by the death of African-American George Floyd in US police custody on 25 May. ""Moving forward, The Simpsons will no longer have white actors voice non-white characters,"" the producers said in a short statement. In January, Mr Azaria said he would no longer be performing the voice of Indian convenience store owner Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, a role he had played since the character was created in 1990. ""We all made the decision together... We all agreed on it. We all feel like it's the right thing,"" he said at the time. The show had been accused of using the character in a way that reinforced racial stereotypes. Mr Azaria - who provides the voice of other characters, including black police officer Lou and the Mexican-American Bumblebee Man - said he found it ""very upsetting to me personally and professionally"" that anyone felt marginalised because of Apu. Fox Network's statement on Friday did not say whether Apu or other characters would continue to feature in the show. Other white US actors to announce that they will no longer be providing voiceovers for people of colour include Mike Henry and Kristen Bell. Mr Henry provided the voice of black character Cleveland Brown in the animated series Family Guy for 20 years. ""I love this character, but persons of colour should play characters of colour,"" he tweeted on Friday. Ms Bell, who provided the voice of Molly, a mixed-race child, in the cartoon series Central Park, said doing so displayed ""a lack of awareness"". ""Casting a mixed race character [with a] white actress undermines the specificity of the mixed race and Black American experience,"" she added.","US animated comedy series The Simpsons will no longer use white actors for the voices of characters from other ethnic backgrounds, the show's producers say."

"By Annabel RackhamEntertainment reporter The procedure involves injecting dermal fillers into the lips to create volume and has become increasingly popular in recent years. The 20-year-old is among a number of celebrities whose looks have influenced trends in cosmetic procedures. Jenner admitted during an episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians in 2015 that her natural lips had been ""an insecurity"" that she wanted to change with temporary lip fillers. She later went on to launch her brand Kylie Cosmetics, which included a line of lip products designed to help customers make their lips look bigger through over-lining and filling. But now the mother-of-one has written on Instagram to say she has dissolved the fillers, after a follower asked why her lips looked smaller. Jenner's decision comes at a time when cosmetic trends are changing as extreme Botox and big breast implants are giving way to a more natural look. Last year it was reported, the cosmetic surgery industry in the UK was worth an estimated £3.6 billion. As there are no regulations in the UK covering dermal fillers and non-surgical treatments, they can be administered by anyone. This also means it is harder to keep track of how many people are having procedures done and there are currently no official statistics to draw from. ""No more Joan Rivers"" Celebrities who couldn't frown or raise their eyebrows due to Botox were previously staple fodder for comedians to take aim at, but now, according to plastic surgeon Marc Pacifico, this look (and joke) is a thing of the past. Renee Zellweger was heavily criticised in 2014 for her new look after allegedly having plastic surgery, while stars like Nicole Kidman and Jennifer Aniston claim they gave up on injections after getting negative responses from the public and media alike. ""I've had a couple of consultations where Meghan Markle has been referenced as an aesthetic goal and target. People want treatments to look fresh and bright,"" Pacifico tells the BBC. ""We want to make sure someone looks natural and refreshed, not frozen."" He thinks older celebrities are now more likely to embrace their lines and wrinkles, leading to a change away from cosmetic surgery procedures such as face lifts and Botox. Last year in the UK, women had 1,857 face and neck lifts, which is down 44% from 2016 according to The British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS). Pacifico says: ""With face lifts now, rather than turning back the clock to look younger, it's about looking the best you can for your age - no more 'Joan Rivers'!"" ""Now people never want to hear the comment 'What have you had done?'"" ""The Baywatch generation has gone"" Pamela Anderson and Carmen Electra's characters on the 1990s TV show Baywatch epitomised glamour, inspiring a generation of women to get breast augmentation surgery. But now, celebrities are opting to reduce or even remove their implants, including Victoria Beckham and Sharon Osbourne. ""We've moved away from bigger is better,"" Pacifico says. ""There's much more recognition and understanding that a more modest size looks better and lasts longer - young people are recognising that the decisions they make now are for the next 15 years or so."" He says, ""The Baywatch generation has gone, much in the same way Kylie Jenner had lip fillers removed, celebrities are talking about having large implants removed."" Last year in the UK there were 3,747 breast reduction surgeries, a 5% increase from 2016. ""The issue with Love Island"" Pacifico works with BAAPS, who last week called for plastic surgery adverts to be banned. It comes after the Head of NHS England, Simon Stevens, raised concerns about them appearing during Love Island ad breaks. Stevens claimed the images were ""playing into a set of pressures around body image"", leading to young people needing mental health services. This was echoed by Pacifico, who says he also takes issue with the ITV2 show. ""There are some role models that might not be that healthy, with a flawed perception of what is normal [on the programme]."" He says he sees the influence of reality TV shows and social media affecting young people who come in for procedures, particularly lip fillers. ""Lip fillers are an ever popular procedure and clients ask for a natural look - but it's deemed not enough. It goes back to an aesthetic compass,"" Pacifico says. ""Someone over 35 will agree with me, but someone in their 20s will ask for more filler despite having more volume because of their age. ""It comes back to that risky combination of influence of role models and what they're doing and social media and the pressures to always look your best."" For consultant surgeon Rajiv Grover, he is more concerned by the medical complications with lip fillers. ""One only has to look at the constant stream of cautionary tales of botched filler stories in the media to see that the current landscape of unregulated non-surgical treatment is absolutely dire,"" he says in a medical report on lip fillers. ""The complications arising from dermal fillers - which can include very serious infections, skin necrosis, and blindness - can often not be recognised, much less be treated by, amateur injectors, leaving the problems on the doorstep of the overstretched NHS."" ""In 15-20 years we will see some repercussions"" Although Pacifico has noticed a shift towards more natural looking cosmetic procedures, he says there are celebrities and reality stars whose surgery is still promoting an unhealthy image. He says he has ""concerns"" about the current bigger bum trend, popularised by Kim Kardashian and Iggy Azalea. Bum implants, lifts and fat injections have become extremely popular recently, but are far from risk free. Rapper Cardi B has spoken out about her botched bum implants, whilst reality star Alicia Douvall appeared on Celebrity Botched Up Bodies after her implants leaked. ""It is not a procedure I perform a lot of, we're not in Miami or Brazil and people aren't exposed as much,"" Pacifico says. ""But in 15-20 years we will be seeing some repercussions when fashions change and the aging process takes hold."" Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

But director Francis Lee tweeted he thought it was appropriate ""after seeing queer history be routinely 'straightened' throughout culture"". ""Given a historical figure where there is no evidence whatsoever of a heterosexual relationship, is it not permissible to view that person within another context...?"" The Telegraph quoted a member of Anning's family, Barbara Anning, who said: ""I believe if Mary Anning was gay she should be portrayed as gay and this should also be by a gay actress. ""But I do not believe there is any evidence to back up portraying her as a gay woman… I believe Mary Anning was abused because she was poor, uneducated and a woman. Is that not enough?"" Lee tweeted his response to ""huge speculation about my new film and the 'controversial' flames that have been fanned on a slow 'news' story day by newspapers and columnists who haven't read my script or know anything about my film"". ""Would these newspaper writers have felt the need to whip up uninformed quotes from self-proclaimed experts if the character's sexuality had been assumed to be heterosexual?"" he asked. The Mail reported Barbara Anning told them that the 'the lesbian storyline is pure Hollywood"". Filming started last week on the Jurassic coast. Lee, who directed the critically acclaimed God's Own Country, described his characters as ""truthful"": ""As a working class, queer film maker, I continually explore the themes of class, gender, sexuality within my work, treating my truthful characters with utter respect and I hope giving them authentic respectful lives and relationships they deserve.""

"The star sued Topshop's parent company Arcadia for $5 million (£3.3m) over the T-shirts, which featured a photo taken during a video shoot in 2011. Her lawyers told the High Court in London the fashion chain duped fans and may have damaged her reputation. They said the picture was ""very similar"" to images used on CD sleeves for one of her albums. Judge Mr Justice Birss ruled that a ""substantial number"" of buyers were likely to have been deceived into buying the T-shirt because of a ""false belief"" it had been approved by the singer. He said it was damaging to her ""goodwill"" and represented a loss of control over Rihanna's reputation in the ""fashion sphere"". Topshop's lawyers had claimed the 25-year-old was making an unjustifiable bid to establish a ""free standing image right"" over use of her picture in the UK. The photograph used by Topshop had been taken during filming of a music video in Northern Ireland in 2011. In a two-minute judgment, Mr Justice Birss said there was ""no such thing as a general right by a famous person to control the reproduction of their image"". ""The taking of the photograph is not suggested to have breached Rihanna's privacy,"" he continued. ""The mere sale by a trader of a T-shirt bearing an image of a famous person is not an act of passing off. ""However, I find that Topshop's sale of this T-shirt was an act of passing off."" Mr Justice Birss did not make an assessment of any liable damages in his ruling. Topshop said it was ""surprised, disappointed and perplexed"" by the High Court decision. ""There was no intention to create an appearance of an endorsement or promotion,"" it said. ""We feel that the fact that Rihanna has shopped, worn and had a relationship with Topshop for several years appears to have been detrimental to our case.""

Her first collection for the fashion retailer went on sale in spring 2013.",Pop singer Rihanna has won a legal battle with clothing retailer Topshop over a T-shirt bearing her image.
"Mark Forstater, who produced the 1975 film Monty Python And The Holy Grail, claimed he was underpaid royalties since the musical's launch in 2005. He estimated he was entitled to more than £200,000. Three stars of the cult Python film - Eric Idle, Michael Palin and Terry Jones - gave evidence at the trial. Written by Eric Idle, hit musical Spamalot was described on posters as being ""lovingly ripped off"" from the 1975 film Holy Grail. 'Seventh Python' It premiered on Broadway in 2005, taking $1m in its opening week and went on to win three Tony Awards. Mr Forstater, had argued that for ""financial purposes"" he should be treated as ""the seventh Python"". Under the terms of a 1974 agreement with Python (Monty) Pictures (PMP), investors in the film, such as Mr Forstater, were entitled to a share in 50% of all merchandise revenues and spin-off income. With regard to Spamalot, Mr Forstater claimed he was entitled to one-seventh of this figure, the same share enjoyed by each of the other Pythons - but was told he was only entitled to one-fourteenth, and has been paid accordingly since 2005. Palin, Jones and Idle, who formed the comedy outfit with John Cleese, Terry Gilliam and Graham Chapman more than 40 years ago, disagreed. Idle said the suggestion that Mr Forstater was a ""seventh Python"" was laughable. Palin said Mr Forstater was ""not part of our team"", while Jones said Mr Forstater had ""done jolly well"" out of his involvement with Monty Python. Following Judge Mr Justice Norris's ruling on Friday, Mr Forstater said: ""I have always been adamant I was correct. I have been proved right - justice has prevailed. ""There is a sadness, though, about having to face people who were my friends in court,"" he said. ""We have been friends for a long time. Monty Python are an institution. I like the fact that they have apparently joked about the litigation. ""I still think they are very funny."" Cheese straws During his judgement, Mr Justice Norris said Mr Forstater had given evidence in ""a measured way"", while Palin and Jones had been ""trustworthy"" witnesses. He added: ""Eric Idle was frank enough to acknowledge that he now disliked Mr Forstater, but he expressed the hope that, in his evidence, he was being honest and that his dislike did not affect his honesty. ""I think he largely achieved that aim so far as conscious effort could take him. He undoubtedly regarded Mr Forstater as ungrateful."" During evidence, a diary entry from Palin from 1975 relating to the situation recalled ""....as we are a soft lot and not at all businesslike, I think it would be in the finest traditions of Python irrationality if we gave Mark an extra £1,000 and a silver tray with some cut-glass sherry glasses and told him to stop writing to us for more money. Beyond that even I am not prepared to go. Oh, all right, some cheese straws to go with the sherry glasses."" Mr Forstater estimated he was entitled to more than £200,000 but said the final figures would be worked out at later hearings. Like the film upon which it is based, the stage comedy is about a group of medieval knights searching for the mythical Holy Grail but the plot broadens out to spoof Broadway, and various musicals, including those of Andrew Lloyd Webber. It is currently showing at London's Playhouse Theatre. Mr Forstater was made bankrupt in June 2012, but the bankruptcy was annulled in October last year and he entered an independent voluntary arrangement (IVA) to deal with his debts.","A film producer has won a High Court case against the surviving members of Monty Python over royalty rights to the hit stage show, Spamalot."
"Netflix said it would hold talks with the producers to see if production, which was suspended this week, could resume without Spacey. Netflix also said it would not release Spacey's film about writer Gore Vidal. Meanwhile, police in the UK have opened an investigation into the American actor over an alleged sexual assault. A British actor said he had woken up to find Spacey performing a sex act on him in 2008, the Sun newspaper reported. The man is said to have run from the property after Spacey allegedly said: ""Don't tell anyone about this."" Spacey said on Thursday he was seeking treatment after facing allegations of sexual misconduct from a string of men. Netflix suspended production on House of Cards on 31 October following allegations by Star Trek actor Anthony Rapp, who said Spacey had tried to ""seduce"" him when he was 14. Spacey said he was ""beyond horrified"" to hear of the incident, which he said he did not remember. 'Hiatus time' House of Cards, which is based on a BBC programme, was first broadcast in 2013. The first season garnered nine Emmy nominations, becoming the first online streaming series to win such mainstream accolades. ""Netflix will not be involved with any further production of House of Cards that includes Kevin Spacey,"" a company spokesperson said in a statement. ""We will continue to work with MRC [series producer Media Rights Capital] during this hiatus time to evaluate our path forward as it relates to the show. ""We have also decided we will not be moving forward with the release of the film Gore, which was in post-production, starring and produced by Kevin Spacey."" MRC said in a statement earlier that it was ""deeply troubled"" about the allegations against Spacey. It said it had dealt with one incident in 2012 in which an unnamed crew member ""shared a complaint about a specific remark and gesture made by Kevin Spacey"", that immediate action had been taken and that the issue had been resolved. Spacey had ""willingly participated in a training process"", it added.","Entertainment company Netflix has severed ties with Kevin Spacey, star of its House of Cards show, amid a number of sex assault allegations against him."

"Will GompertzArts editor@WillGompertzBBCon Twitter Champagne tastes like sheet metal after the third glass. Sunbathing gives you cancer. And the ubiquity of Henry Moore sculptures in English market towns in the 1970s put me off his work for a quarter of a century. Back then, in Harold Wilson's Britain, Moore's monumental stone figures and giant abstract casts had the same worthy municipal feel as the local town hall. Any conurbation large enough to support a Boots, a cinema and a public convenience seemed compelled to plonk an enormous Moore sculpture on a prize piece of public real estate. His misshapen family groups and huge pierced boulders of bronze were like those fashionable avocado bathrooms - not nearly as groovy as the older generation thought. More Abigail's Party than the Sex Pistols. I wasn't alone in wanting no more Moore. In 1967, he offered the Tate Gallery ""20 or 30 major pieces"". Fellow artists were less keen, saying it was wrong to devote so much space to a single living artist (Moore had insisted his gift be on permanent display, which would have taken up a sizable chunk of the Tate's sculpture galleries). The Tate declined - and the artist gave the work to a grateful Art Gallery of Ontario instead. That was then. Forty years later, I have aged, and so have Moore's sculptures. They have fared much better than me - they look terrific now. Maybe it's their sense of calm permanence in our superficial, super-fast world, or my romanticising of Moore's post-war vision of modernity. Either way, it was a pleasure to spend yesterday at his old home in Perry Green, Hertfordshire, which is now The Henry Moore Foundation. He was a sincere and dedicated artist who knew he wanted to be a sculptor aged 11, had his first commissions in his teens, and went on to excel at the Leeds School of Art. There he met and befriended another aspiring young sculptor called Barbara Hepworth, who, like Moore, was inspired by the Yorkshire landscape of their birth. He read widely, immersed himself in art and drew on influences far and wide, from primitive African artefacts to Parisian Cubism. His intellectual and technical wherewithal enabled him to successfully incorporate all these ingredients into harmonious, pleasing forms that feel both ancient and modern. It's what gives his work such broad appeal and why it can be seen in hundreds of cities around the world - there is something in it for everyone. His drawings of sheep and apple trees have an intensity and energy that feels kinetic. You'll see plenty of the real thing if you sit at his old oak desk in the little shed with a picture window that looks out onto the fields of sheep that frequently wander over to look at you. There are some good drawings from his student days, which you can see in an exhibition opening this Saturday at the Foundation called Becoming Henry Moore. There are plenty of sculptures, too, in the exhibition and dotted about the 70 acres of landscape, which the canny Moore used as a showroom for potential clients. They look good. Much better than they did in those tired old market towns. Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

"It is one of 41 pieces of post-war public art in England newly protected by the government. The list also includes three works by Barbara Hepworth and one by Henry Moore, opposite Parliament in London. Heritage minister Tracey Crouch said: ""Not only are they magnificent sculptures but they are also an important part of our history."" The bright red work of art (and 40 others) now protected 'Precious national collection' Gormley's Untitled [Listening] in Camden, north London, was one of the artist's first public sculpture commissions and dates back to 1984. The work, in Maygrove Peace Park, shows a human figure sat on a boulder, cupping an ear. It was commissioned by Camden Council to show its commitment to peace, with the park opened on the anniversary of the atomic bomb being dropped on Nagasaki, Japan. Hepworth's Winged Figure, on London's Oxford Street, and Single Form (Memorial) in Battersea Park, London, have been given Grade II* status, with Rosewall (Curved Reclining Form) in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, given Grade II listing. The Oxford Street work was designed to make people ""feel airborne in rain and sunlight"", she said, with the Battersea Park sculpture being her response to the death of a friend. Knife Edge Two Piece, an abstract bronze sculpture by Henry Moore which can be found opposite the Houses of Parliament, has also been listed. The 41 sculptures reflect life in the years following the war, with themes including industry, family and play. There is also a work commemorating children killed in the Blitz. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport made the listings on advice from Historic England. Roger Bowdler, the body's director of listing, said: ""These sculptures were commissioned and created for everybody and have become a precious national collection of art which we can all share. ""They enrich our lives, bring art to everyone and deserve celebration. We have worked with the Public Monuments and Sculpture Association, Tate, and the Twentieth Century Society throughout this project to ensure our most special public art is protected and continues to enhance our public spaces."" Fifteen of the newly-listed works are outside of London, including three in Harlow, Essex, which has become known as the Sculpture Town. A map has been made showing the locations of all of the sculptures.",An Antony Gormley sculpture has been given Grade II protected status - his first to be listed.
"The gallery said A Walk Through British Art, featuring work from the 1500s to the present day, allowed ""a more neutral view of the range of art being produced at any one historical moment to emerge"". It also features new permanent galleries devoted to poet and artist William Blake and sculptor Henry Moore. Michael Glover - The Independent The curators have been encouraged to look at the Tate's vast holdings year by year, with a plodding degree of thoroughness, in order to spot the unusual. Those many unusuals have now been deftly inserted into the story of British art. New names interrupt the flow. What is more, paintings made at about the same time - they might be separated by just a year or two - have, generally speaking, been hung close to each other so that we can see for ourselves quite how much obfuscation has gone on in the past, how many lies or half-truths the tellers of art's tale have been peddling. Read the full review The first thing to say about [Tate Britain director Penelope] Curtis's rehang is that it is gloriously, satisfyingly, reactionary. In 20 galleries that are intended as an introduction to British art for the general public, about 500 works of art including paintings, sculpture and drawings are hung chronologically from the 16th to the 21st centuries. This is art history as it used to be taught before it was hijacked by academic theorists. Every gallery is labelled by the date of the art shown in it, and just in case anyone might think the redisplay is temporary, those dates are set into the floor in large gold letters at the entrance. Read the full review There are several winners in this chronological hand. The principal one is Tate Britain: where the collection is thin, the ground can be covered more evenly... The loser looks set to be the student armed with his or her art history book. The labelling is minimal. There is nothing to guide you through major art movements. And so what, to the expert, might seem delightfully risque, may feel confusing to the novice. The curators' answer is simple - use your eyes. Read the full review [subscription required] Visitors to Tate Britain are in for a shock. It may take a while to register. When it does, the revolution perpetrated by the museum's director, Penelope Curtis, explodes into view. There are no explanatory texts by the works of art... What truly stands out, from the sensitive choices of real gems of artworks to their spacious yet detailed placing in sumptuously redecorated galleries, is the passion for British art that fuels this epic display. It makes the case for British art, not just today but since the 1500s, as abounding in originality, ripe with personality, and often unexpectedly beautiful. It is a revelatory journey to meet the British.

There is more sculpture than before.

"He told the Observerthe project, which has been years in the planning, would include six galleries and a cafe. ""It's my Saatchi gallery, basically,"" he said. Works by Hirst and others, including Banksy and US artist Jeff Koons, will be exhibited. From 4 April, the Tate Modern will exhibit a Hirst retrospective. Hirst told the Observer his gallery, in Newport Street, Vauxhall, would be ""a place to show my collection of contemporary art"", which reportedly includes more than 2,000 pieces. ""It feels bad having it all in crates. It's basically Bacon and beyond."" Hirst, who owns five paintings by the late Francis Bacon, added: ""He didn't make many and he's not making any more."" Art champion The gallery - designed by architects Caruso St John - will take up the whole of Newport Street and incorporates the conversion of a terrace of three listed buildings flanked by two new buildings. Hirst's gallery follows in the footsteps of London's Saatchi Gallery, opened in 1985 by art collector Charles Saatchi to display his own collection to the public. Saatchi also sponsored Hirst, who first came to the public's attention with his 1988 Freeze exhibition of his own works and those of his fellow Goldsmiths College students. BBC Arts editor Will Gompertz said Hirst's work as a curator and champion of new art that started with Freeze - from behind-the-scenes support of unknown artists through to collecting and exhibiting - was often overlooked. ""Charles Saatchi didn't make Damien Hirst, Damien Hirst made Charles Saatchi,"" he said. Hirst has previously said that collecting ""is the way the world works, as a human being.

"In The Upside, the US actor plays a wheelchair-using billionaire who hires a former criminal, played by comedian Kevin Hart, to be his live-in carer. ""As actors we're asked to play other people,"" said the Breaking Bad star. Cranston said the subject was ""worthy for debate"" and there should be ""more opportunities"" for disabled actors. Yet he maintained he was entitled to play characters whose attributes and abilities differed from his own. ""If I, as a straight, older person, and I'm wealthy, I'm very fortunate, does that mean I can't play a person who is not wealthy, does that mean I can't play a homosexual?"" he mused. ""I don't know, where does the restriction apply, where is the line for that?"" he told the Press Association. Jake Gyllenhaal and Dwayne Johnson are among others who have faced criticism for playing disabled characters. Gyllenhaal's 2017 film Stronger, about a man who lost both legs in the Boston Marathon bombings, was criticised for not casting a disabled actor in the role. Last year, meanwhile, Johnson was censured for calling for more disabled actors on screen while also playing a man with a prosthetic leg in action film Skyscraper. Cranston's comments come in the wake of ongoing debate over whether it is appropriate for straight actors to play gay or transgender roles or for white actors to play characters associated with ethnic minorities. Scarlett Johansson, Tilda Swinton, Jack Whitehall and Ed Skrein are among those who have faced criticism for accepting certain roles. Some have gone on to withdraw from projects following a backlash. Last month Darren Criss said he would no longer accept LGBT scripts because he did not want to be ""another straight boy taking a gay man's role"". The Glee actor played a gay serial killer in American Crime Story: The Assassination of Gianni Versace - a performance that won him an Emmy in December and a Golden Globe on Sunday. Hart, meanwhile, believes there are always positives to discussions about diversity and inclusion. ""I think having a conversation started is always a good thing,"" he said. ""In this particular case, bringing awareness to the fact that hey, we would love to see more disabled people given the opportunities to participate in the entertainment world, and potentially grow."" The comedian turned actor faced renewed criticism himself recently for comments he made in 2010 about his fears that his son might grow up gay. Criticism of his remarks led to him stepping down as host of next month's Oscars ceremony and apologising to the LGBTQ community for his ""insensitive words"". Hart apologised again this week on his SiriusXM radio show, saying he was ""now aware"" of how his words had make members of the LGBTQ community feel. ""I think that in the times that we're living in, we have to be understanding and accepting of people and change,"" he told his listeners. Britain's Ben Whishaw expressed similar sentiments to Cranston's on Sunday after winning a Golden Globe for playing a gay man in A Very English Scandal. ""I really believe that actors can embody and portray anything and we shouldn't be defined only by what we are,"" said the openly gay actor. ""On the other hand, I think there needs to be greater equality,"" he continued. ""I would like to see more gay actors playing straight roles. ""It should be an even playing field for everybody. That would be my ideal."" The Upside, which also stars Nicole Kidman and Julianna Margulies, opens in the UK on 11 January.

"Jenkins beat the previous record set by Sam Taylor-Johnson for Fifty Shades of Grey, which opened with $85.1m in 2015. Wonder Woman, starring Israeli actress Gal Gadot, has received largely positive reviews from film critics. Hollywood is known for its reluctance to hire female directors, especially for blockbuster superhero movies. Wonder Woman is the first female-led superhero film to be directed by a woman. ""Globally this property has just resonated with fans,"" said Warner Bros' distribution chief Jeff Goldstein. ""There's something iconic about... the story of Wonder Woman that's hitting the zeitgeist perfectly."" Wonder Woman was also number one in the UK, earning £6.18m over the weekend. However, that was not enough to beat Sam Taylor-Wood's £13.5 million opening weekend for Fifty Shades of Grey in 2015. Gadot made her debut as Diana Prince/Wonder Woman in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice last year. Goldstein said the studio knew they had ""something special"" after the reception to Gadot in that film. ""While the story was critically tough, she emerged as a real bright spot,"" Goldstein said. Prior to Wonder Woman, Jenkins was best known for her 2003 Oscar-winning film Monster, based on the life of serial killer Aileen Wuornos. Charlize Theron won an Oscar for her leading role in the film. The only other major release this weekend was Fox's Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie, which took $23.5m (£18.2m). Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales was in third in its second week of release with about $21.6m (£16.74m).

"The memorial will sit at the foot of the stone commemorating his publisher and fellow writer, TS Eliot. Hughes' friend and poet Seamus Heaney and actress Juliet Stevenson will give readings at the event on 6 December. It was announced last year that Hughes would be honoured in Poets' Corner but the exact location was not known. Heaney had spearheaded the campaign for Hughes to be remembered in Poets' Corner. Hughes' first book of poems, Hawk in the Rain, won critical acclaim upon its release in 1957. He was married to the American poet Sylvia Plath until her suicide in 1963. His last poetic work, Birthday Letters, explored their relationship. Hughes was made Poet Laureate in 1984 and remained in the post until his death from cancer in 1998. Hughes' widow Carol, who he married in 1970, and his daughter Frieda will be among those attending the ceremony, when the Kirkstone green slate memorial stone will be laid. Famous poets buried in Westminster Abbey include Lord Tennyson and Robert Browning.",The late Ted Hughes is to be celebrated in Westminster Abbey next month at a ceremony to place a memorial stone in Poets' Corner.
"By Neil SmithArts reporter Barry, who won the prize in 2008 with The Secret Scripture, said he was ""quite overwhelmed"" to get it again. The 61-year-old is one of five category winners whose works will now compete for the Costa Book of the Year award. If Barry wins on 31 January, he will become the first novelist to receive the prestigious accolade twice. The author, who is also a playwright, went on to win book of the year with The Secret Scripture nine years ago. 'Outrageously kind' ""As a writer, it's one of the definitions of lovely news,"" the Dublin-born writer told the BBC News website on Tuesday. ""A bunch of people alive in your time have got together and decided they want to do something outrageously kind, which is to give you a prize."" The author went on to equate the award with ""running away with the circus"" or taking part in a horse race with his fellow category winners. ""I don't know if we're horses or jockeys; maybe we're a combination,"" he said from his home in County Wicklow. ""I think we'll feel a very comradely sense of running, at least briefly, in the same race."" Other winners announced on Tuesday included Brian Conaghan, who received the children's book award for The Bombs that Brought Us Together. The Scottish author, who originally received 217 rejections before finding a publisher and an agent, said his win was ""lovely news to start 2017"". ""To have won the Costa Children's Book Award is completely unexpected and to say I'm staggered and excited would be an understatement,"" he continued. His winning novel - his third book - tells of two friends trying to survive in a war zone. Keggie Carew receives the Costa biography award for Dadland, an exploration of her late father's past. The Salisbury-based author said it was ""wonderful to know"" that people were responding to her work ""in the way I had hoped"". ""2017 could not have started with better news,"" she said in a statement. ""Dad would have been amazed.""

"The show's current host Chris Evans revealed the news live on air, as part of his ""great job Wednesday"" segment. ""This is bonkers. I'm not underestimating the task ahead of me,"" said Ball, revealing she ""definitely didn't expect to get the call"" from Radio 2 bosses. The star, 47, was the first female breakfast show host on Radio 1 and will now repeat the honour on Radio 2. She becomes the seventh person to host the UK's most listened-to breakfast show full-time. Ball, who earned between £250,000 and £299,000 for her various presenting jobs at the BBC last year, will get a significant pay rise for her new role. Evans, 52, was paid £1.6m last year to host the show, which is listened to by a weekly audience of 9 million people. Speaking to the BBC's Lizo Mzimba on Wednesday, Ball said she was ""not expecting the same"" as Evans but was ""very, very happy with what the BBC are paying me."" Strictly hopes On Evans's show, the broadcaster said she had known ""for weeks"" that she would be taking over and that she hoped to continue hosting Strictly: It Takes Two on BBC Two. ""That's my other favourite job. So I'm really hoping I'll be able to do both."" She added that she was feeling ""a crazy mix of elation, wanting to burst into tears, wanting to run away... but mainly thrilled"". She also revealed that her son Woody had encouraged her to take the job, telling her it was ""the coolest thing"" and reassuring her that ""someone will listen"". Her appointment follows Chris Evans's decision to leave Radio 2 after eight years hosting the breakfast show and 13 years on the station. Evans is leaving Radio 2 to host Virgin Radio's breakfast show, so he and Ball will compete for listeners in the new year. ""I'm going to be your opponent again,"" Ball told Evans earlier. ""Will you leave some of your listeners?"" The BBC said Sara Cox - who many had tipped to be Evans's replacement - would be her stand-in when she is away, for 10 weeks each year. The new host of Ball's current Saturday afternoon show on Radio 2 will be announced in due course. Bob Shennan, the BBC's director of radio and music, said hosting the Radio 2 Breakfast Show was ""arguably the most coveted job in UK radio"". ""I'm thrilled that the baton is now passing to Zoe, who I know will make the show her very own,"" the former Radio 2 controller said in a statement. Ball's appointment means that four of the BBC's six music radio stations will have a female breakfast show host in the new year - with Ball on Radio 2, Lauren Laverne on 6 Music, Harpz Kaur on Asian Network and Dotty on 1Xtra. The star's appointment was welcomed on social media, with Twitter user Sara Millburn saying it was ""fab news"". BBC Breakfast's Dan Walker echoed those sentiments, saying she was ""talented, fun, enthusiastic [and] generous"". ""She will be brilliant,"" he tweeted. Yet others have suggested Sara Cox would have been a ""better choice"" and that ""so many people"" had wanted her to take over. Ball began her presenting career in the 1990s, hosting The Big Breakfast on Channel 4 and BBC One's Saturday morning children's programme Live & Kicking. Between 1996 and 1998 she regularly presented Top of the Pops. Her first foray into radio presenting came in 1997, when she became the first female DJ to present the BBC Radio 1 breakfast show alongside Kevin Greening. She left the station in 2000, returning to radio in 2002 as a presenter at XFM. Since 2006 she has presented as a stand-in on BBC Radio 2 and had her own Saturday breakfast show from 2009 to 2012. She has covered for Chris Evans a number of times on the Radio 2 Breakfast Show and got her own show on the network last year, taking over Saturday afternoons from Dermot O'Leary. Ball took part in a Sport Relief challenge in March 2018 in memory of her late boyfriend, Billy Yates.

"Chapman shot Lennon four times outside his New York Manhattan apartment as Ono looked on, in 1980. He was denied parole for the eleventh time following a hearing last month. During the hearing, Chapman said he killed the 40-year-old rock star for ""glory"" and that he deserved the death penalty. He added that he thinks about the ""despicable act"" all the time, and accepts he may spend the rest of his life in prison. 'He was an icon' ""I just want to reiterate that I'm sorry for my crime,"" Chapman told the parole board at the Wende Correctional Facility in New York. ""I have no excuse. This was for self-glory. I think it's the worst crime that there could be to do something to someone that's innocent. ""He was extremely famous. I didn't kill him because of his character or the kind of man he was. He was a family man. He was an icon. He was someone that spoke of things that now we can speak of and it's great. ""I assassinated him, to use your word earlier, because he was very, very, very famous and that's the only reason and I was very, very, very, very much seeking self-glory, very selfish,"" he added. ""I want to add that and emphasise that greatly. It was an extremely selfish act. I'm sorry for the pain that I caused to her [Ono]. I think about it all of the time."" In 2015, the Japanese artist - who has contested each one of Chapman's attempts at parole - told The Daily Beast that she lived in fear of him being let out of prison. ""One thing I think is that he did it once, he could do it again, to somebody else - you know. It could be me, it could be Sean [her son], it could be anybody, so there is that concern,"" she said. The latest hearing documents, obtained by the Press Association, show the board rejected his release on the grounds it ""would be incompatible with the welfare of society"". Chapman was 25 at the time of the crime. Now 65, he is married and his wife lives near the facility where he has been for the last eight years. At the parole board meeting he was described as being deeply religious and a ""devoted Christian"". He is also a clerk and a porter in a restricted block of the prison, where he was placed for his own safety. 'Isolation and loneliness' Lennon's killer was famously carrying the JD Salinger book, Catcher in the Rye, when he committed the murder. Discussing his love of the book at the time, he told the board how he had identified with the main character's ""isolation"" and ""loneliness"". He went on to say that he deserved the death penalty - it was abolished in the state of New York in 2007 although no execution had taken place since 1963. ""When you knowingly plot someone's murder and know it's wrong and you do it for yourself, that's a death penalty right there in my opinion,"" said Chapman. ""Some people disagree with me, but everybody gets a second chance now."" Asked if justice had been served, Chapman said: ""I deserve zero, nothing. ""If the law and you choose to leave me in here for the rest of my life, I have no complaint whatsoever."" In its decision, the New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision board said it found Chapman's statement that ""infamy brings you glory"" disturbing, and recommended his ""personal growth and productive use of time"". The board also noted how Chapman's ""selfish actions stole the chance for future fans to experience the words of inspiration that this artist provided for millions of people"". ""Your violent act caused devastation to not only family and former band members, but the world,"" it added. Chapman is next eligible for parole in two years.

"The painting, also known as The Raising of Lazarus, is believed to have been painted in 1609, one year before the artist's death at the age of 38. It depicts the story in the Gospel of St John in which Jesus raises Lazarus from the dead. It marks the first time the painting has been restored in 60 years. It will remain in Rome until 15 July. The painting was housed for centuries in the church of the Crociferi fathers in Messina, Sicily, before it was moved to the city's museum. It shows the instant that Christ points to the dead Lazarus - who is being held in the arms of those who exhumed him - and brings his friend back to life. The background of the painting is mostly dark, which art historians say was probably because Caravaggio was in a hurry to complete the commission. ""During this period of his life, Caravaggio was forced to finish his paintings very quickly, and therefore he refined his technique in order to achieve this objective,"" said restorer Anna Maria Marcone. ""He used local materials and used the dark background in order to quickly realise the figures,"" she told a news conference. The painting was done on six pieces of canvas - five vertical and one horizontal - that were sewn together to reach the desired size. Marcone said the most difficult part of the restoration was repairing some of the damage done by what was believed to have been the first restoration on the painting, in 1670. The painting was unscathed in the great Messina earthquake of 1908, which killed some 200,000 people and destroyed thousands of buildings in Sicily and Calabria. It will be on display in Rome's Palazzo Braschi, overlooking Piazza Navona, until mid July, when it will be returned to Sicily.","Caravaggio's Resurrection of Lazarus has gone on display in Rome, after seven months of restoration work."

The Sound of Silence, written after the assassination of President Kennedy in 1963, initially flopped, only becoming a hit after it was re-edited. Its subsequent success prompted the duo to reunite and record another album entitled Sounds of Silence in 1966, which Garfunkel said was a life changer for him and his partner, Simon.

"The report by the University of Southern California stated that Hollywood has an ""inclusion crisis"" from CEOs to minor characters. ""Overall, the landscape of media content is still largely whitewashed,"" the study concluded. It comes days ahead of the Oscars, which has been dubbed OscarsSoWhite. The lack of diversity in the Oscar nominations led Spike Lee and Jada Pinkett Smith to boycott the ceremony and Oscars head Cheryl Boone Isaacs to pledge to double the number of female and minority members of the Academy. ""The prequel to OscarsSoWhite is HollywoodSoWhite,"" said associate professor Stacy Smith, one of the study's authors. ""We don't have a diversity problem. We have an inclusion crisis."" The report by the Media, Diversity and Social Change Initiative looked at those in front of the camera and behind the scenes in film and TV. Hollywood diversity report 414 films and TV series were studied. They included 11,300 speaking characters, of which 33% were female 28% were minority ethnic 2% were LGBT-identified 74% of characters over 40 were male The study examined: Out of the 414 films and TV series they studied they found only a third of speaking characters were female. About 50% did not feature one Asian or Asian-American character and 20% did not include one black character. Of the characters that were aged 40 years or older 74.3% were male and 25.7% female. Among the 11,306 speaking characters studied, only seven were transgendered (and four were from the same series). Behind the scenes, 15.2% of directors, 28.9% of writers and 22.6% of series creators were female. In film, the gender gap was the greatest, with only 3.4% of the films studied directed by women. This reflects a report released in January by the Centre for the Study of Women in Television and Film that just 9% of Hollywood's highest grossing films last year were directed by women, the same level as 1998. In May, the American Civil Liberties Union in Southern California sent letters asking federal and state civil rights agencies to investigate the systemic failure to hire women directors at all levels of the film and television industry. And in October, it was reported that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in the US had begun contacting female directors to investigate gender discrimination in Hollywood. 'Pockets of promise' This latest study found only two directors out of the 109 were black women, namely Ava DuVernay, who made Selma, and Amma Asante, who made Belle. The study also included for the first time an ""inclusivity index""' of 10 major media companies which rated their percentage of female, minority and LGBT characters and of female writers and directors. None of the six major studios scored better than 20% overall but there were better ratings with companies that included TV and digital offerings, some of those such as Disney and Hulu reached 65% and above. ""When we turn to see where the problem is better or worse, the apex to this whole endeavour is: Everyone in film is failing, all of the companies investigated,"" said Smith. ""They're impervious to change. But there are pockets of promise in television. There is a focus that change is possible. The very companies that are inclusive - Disney, CW, Hulu, Amazon to some degree — those companies, if they're producing and distributing motion pictures, can do this. ""We now have evidence that they can, and they can thrive.""","Hollywood has an ""epidemic of invisibility"" for women, minorities and LGBT people that runs across the whole industry, a new study has suggested."

It eventually raised more than £65,000. The page said the 38-year-old was in ""a very bad way"" and needed treatment in a rehabilitation centre. Several Big Brother figures including former winner Rylan Clark-Neal retweeted the appeal for donations. In a statement to the BBC, Grahame's manager confirmed ""with immeasurable sadness"" that Grahame had died on Friday morning. ""Please respect the privacy of Nikki's friends and family at this tragic and difficult time,"" he added. Grahame was hugely popular with viewers and was known for her tantrums in the Big Brother house. She would often complain in the diary room about the conditions in the house or fellow contestants, famously shouting ""It's so cold,"" and, on another occasion, asking ""Who is she?"" after a new housemate joined the show. Grahame was voted back into the house four weeks after she was first evicted. She subsequently finished in fifth place. She went on to win a National Television Award for most popular TV contender and starred in her own reality TV series called Princess Nikki. She also guest-starred on programmes such as the Friday Night Project and as a contestant on celebrity editions of shows such as Pointless and The Weakest Link. Prior to finding fame on Big Brother, Grahame was an aspiring actress. She appeared as an extra in the BBC's EastEnders and played a footballer's wife in Sky One's Dream Team. Grahame also appeared as a contestant on ITV's Blind Date and competed in the 2004 Miss Hertfordshire pageant. Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

"Johnson was diagnosed at the end of 2012 and was given 10 months to live after rejecting chemotherapy. But he defied the doctors' predictions and it was recently found that his tumour was less aggressive than normal. He has now had the ""football-size tumour"" removed as well as his pancreas, spleen and part of his stomach. He has cancelled 14 concerts. A statement said: ""Doctors are hopeful that following the surgery the prognosis for Wilko will be positive."" The musician gave an interview to Tony Parsons for GQ magazine before the operation. ""A friend of mine - who is both a photographer and a cancer doctor - became curious as to why I wasn't dead. And why I wasn't even sick,"" he told Parsons. Johnson's tumour was found to be a rare type called a neuroendocrine tumour. According to Pancreatic Cancer UK, these account for less than 5% of all pancreatic tumours and tend to grow much more slowly than other types. 'Extraordinary development' The operation also involved the removal of Johnson's small and large intestines and the removal and reconstruction of blood vessels relating to the liver, Parsons reported. ""In this extraordinary development, Wilko has undergone an unprecedented operation that is nothing less than a reprieve of a death sentence,"" he wrote. After the tumour was first discovered, Johnson spoke strikingly about how the diagnosis had given him a new outlook on life. ""We walked out of there [the hospital] and I felt an elation of spirit,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Front Row. ""You're walking along and suddenly you're vividly alive. You're looking at the trees and the sky and everything and it's just, 'Whoah.'"" 'Out of action' A farewell tour has since come and gone, and he has continued to be well enough to perform. He supported Status Quo in March and April. He also recorded an album with The Who singer Roger Daltrey, which is currently in the UK top 20. However he has now cancelled all forthcoming concerts while he recovers from the operation. He had 14 gigs scheduled between May and July. The statement, released on Wednesday, said: ""Dr Feelgood legend Wilko Johnson has today reluctantly had to cancel all of his public engagements. ""Wilko, currently riding high in the UK album chart with the Roger Daltrey collaboration Going Back Home, has sought further advice about his pancreatic cancer and as a result has undergone a medical procedure that will see him out of action for the foreseeable future.""",Former Dr Feelgood guitarist Wilko Johnson has had a major operation in an attempt to treat his pancreatic cancer.

"The ministry has granted permission for the film - due out in Russia next week - to be screened with a 16+ age rating. The decision comes after a Russian MP petitioned Culture Minister Vladimir Medinsky to ban it over the inclusion of a gay character. A Russian law prohibits the spreading of ""gay propaganda"" among minors. The 2013 legislation, which angered human rights activists and the international gay community, describes homosexuality as ""non-traditional sexual relations"". More on gay rights in Russia Beauty and the Beast director Bill Condon has spoken about the ""exclusively gay moment"" in the film. It involves LeFou, played by US actor Josh Gad, who is a sidekick of the film's main antagonist Gaston. LeFou tries to come to terms with feelings for Gaston that swing between lust and admiration, as a side-plot to the main story. Emma Watson plays Belle, the young girl who falls in love with a monstrous beast with a dark secret. Her suitors - the Beast and Gaston - are played by British stars Dan Stevens and Luke Evans. The rest of the cast includes Ewan McGregor, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Kevin Kline and Stanley Tucci. Last week, Vitaly Milonov, an MP of the governing United Russia party, urged Mr Medinsky to hold a screening of the film ahead of its release to see if it complied with the law and to ""take measures to totally ban"" it if he found ""elements of propaganda of homosexuality"". The culture ministry told the Associated Press news agency that its decision to give a 16+ rating followed petitions by Mr Milonov.

"She became upset while singing the song REM from her Sweetener album at the Enterprise Center in St Louis, Missouri. In a Twitter post that has since been deleted, she wrote: ""I feel everything very intensely and have committed to doing this tour during a time in my life when I'm still processing a lot. ""So sometimes I cry a lot!"" Grande said she wrote the message ""because I'm grateful and because I want you to know that if you too are hurting, you can push through and are not alone"". The singer has been open about her difficulties since a suicide bomber killed 22 people after her concert in Manchester in May 2017. Also, her ex-boyfriend Mac Miller died last September, and her engagement to comedian Pete Davidson ended in October. Referring to fans on her US tour, she said: ""I'm not sure what I did to deserve to meet so many loving souls every night... but I want you to know that it really does carry me through."" Grande also wrote that her Sweetener tour was ""a dream come true... no matter how hard it gets or how many feelings come up that are screaming at me to be processed and sorted through one day."" The singer added: ""I'm grounded by gratitude and promise not to give up on what I've started."" She wrote: ""It is hard to balance taking care of the people around you, doing your job, and healing/taking care of yourself at the same time... but I want you to know, you aren't alone and I think you're doing great. Love you."" The Sweetener tour began in March, and Grande will visit the UK and Ireland later this year, with dates in London, Birmingham, Glasgow, Sheffield and Dublin.

"By Mark SavageBBC music reporter The singer beat competition from rapper Fredo and indie songwriter Arlo Parks to reach number one with her sumptuous, soulful record Not My Muse. Earlier this week, she received a a Golden Globe nomination for Hear My Voice, which features in the Aaron Sorkin film The Trial Of The Chicago 7. ""This has done the world of good for me,"" said the Brighton-based singer. ""It means a lot for this music to get heard in this way. I can't wait to make more and hopefully I'll see you at all the shows."" Born in LA but raised in Essex and Brighton, Celeste's career has been on an upward trajectory since she won the BBC Sound of 2020 last January. The following month, she wowed the Brits with a stripped-back performance of her signature song, Strange, echoing Adele's career-changing rendition of Someone Like You in 2011. She was later picked to soundtrack the 2020 John Lewis Christmas advert. This weekend, she will sing the lullaby Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star in a Super Bowl ad for Inspiration4, an all-civilian charity space mission. The song will be released as a single immediately afterwards. While fans clamoured for her album, the 26-year-old held fire, using the unusual circumstances of 2020 to refine her music. ""Being in solitude helped me to get back in touch with my thoughts and feelings,"" she told the BBC last month. ""I think, in the process of doing that, I found my true voice again and felt comfortable to let that be heard."" The star, whose husky, soulful voice has been compared to Nina Simone and Billie Holiday, won rave reviews when her album was released last week. The Independent said Not Your Muse would ""lure you back time and time again"", while MusicOMH said it marked the arrival of ""an artist who's going to be around for years to come"". Listeners agreed, sending the record straight to number one - the first time a British female artist has reached that position with their debut album since Jess Glynne's I Cry When I Laugh six years ago. Celeste is also the first winner of the BBC's annual Sound Of... list to reach number one since Years & Years in 2015. In the singles chart, Olivia Rodrigo clung on to the top spot for a fourth week, racking up 69,000 chart sales this week, including 8.3 million streams. The song sold more than twice as many as its nearest competitor, Nathan Evans' viral sea shanty smash, Wellerman. Following Captain Sir Tom Moore's death this week at the age of 100, sales and streams of his charity single You'll Never Walk Alone surged 1864%, said the Official Charts Company.

"1. Everyone loves Timothee Chalamet He missed out on the best actor award to Gary Oldman but Timothee Chalamet was the most tweeted about celebrity on the red carpet, according to Twitter. He certainly looked like he was having the most fun. James Ivory, who won the best adapted screenplay Oscar for Call Me By Your Name, in which Timothee starred, wore his face on his shirt - which went down a storm. His reunion with his Call Me By Your Name co-star Armie Hammer on the red carpet also made a lot of people very happy. There was a lot of love for Timothee at the ceremony too and it seems he made sure he introduced his mum (aaaw!) to all the big names. 2. Wakanda Forever! They weren't eligible to be nominated for this year's Oscars but the cast of Black Panther didn't let that stop them from reigning supreme on the red carpet, with the resulting hashtag #WakandaForever. Chadwick Boseman was the second most tweeted about star on the red carpet. He and his co-stars Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, Daniel Kaluuya and Winston Duke looked like Wakandan royalty. Danai Gurira and Lupita Nyong'o also had a good old catch up with Daniel Kaluuya on the red carpet. 3. Tiffany Haddish next year's host? Tiffany Haddish also had a moment on the red carpet - and pretty much everywhere else she went at the Oscars. She arrived in a traditional Eritrean dress to pay tribute to her dad who died last year, before changing her outfit to present an award with Maya Rudolph. It was a more traditional affair... apart from the furry slippers. A lot of people on Twitter had time for those. Tiffany and Maya's double act went down a storm and many are convinced they should host next year. Haddish changed her dress yet again for the after parties, where she and best actress winner Frances McDormand shared an... erm, interesting greeting. 4. The stars would climb over anything to get to Meryl Streep Haddish also caused a stir on the red carpet when she crossed the velvet ropes to get to greet Meryl Streep. Another star who wouldn't let barriers stop them seeing the Hollywood matriarch was Jennifer Lawrence. Extra points for balancing the wine glass. 5. The set design This year's set design drew a lot of attention on Twitter. To celebrate the 90th anniversary of the awards, set designer Derek McLane used 45 million crystals in his sets - each of which was meant to reflect a different era in the history of movie making. Jillian Leff was one who tweeted: ""I don't care about anything except the stage design"". Many suggested it should be up for an award in itself - including Katy Perry. But not everyone was so keen - Jen Castle was one: ""I'm sorry but there's way too much going on with the set design tonight. It's like the Rococo era threw up on the stage"". 6. Trans history History was made at the Oscars when Daniela Vega took to the stage - she became the first openly trans woman presenter in Oscars history when she introduced Sufjan Stevens's performance of Mystery of Love from Call Me By Your Name. Her film A Fantastic Woman also won the best foreign film Oscar. Patricia Arquette, whose late sister Alexis Arquette was a trans pioneer, was particularly happy. 7. After last year's best picture mix up - always remember to double check the envelope The Shape of Water Director Guillermo del Toro was the second most tweeted-about star at the ceremony. He won best director and best film. But after last year's mess up, he was taking no chances and checked his envelope to make sure. 8. Come for an Oscar, take home a jet ski Host Jimmy Kimmel's offer of a jet ski to whoever did the shortest speech went down well. Dame Helen Mirren had the job of modelling the prize. The winner was Mark Bridges who won best costume design for Phantom Thread. His speech comprised four words: ""Thank you very much"". His happy face is now all over Twitter... He told the BBC's Rebecca Jones that it's all official but he has no idea how to get the vehicle home. 9. Jennifer Garner became a meme Her flowing royal blue gown landed her on the Oscars best dressed list but it seems Jennifer Garner will be remembered for the moment she had a life-changing revelation, mid-ceremony. Left the hob on? Forgot to pick up mum en route to the ceremony?? We REALLY want to find out what she was thinking about. 10. Emma Watson's new tattoo The actress turned heads at the Vanity Fair party when she revealed a massive tattoo demonstrating her commitment to the Time's Up movement. It got everyone talking - partly because it was Hermione with a massive tattoo - but also because it didn't adhere to standard punctuation rules. There was also much debate over whether or not it was real tattoo. The consensus seems to be it's semi-permanent. She might have to add the apostrophe with a sharpie. 11. Macauley Culkin was doing his own thing Finally, a social media star who wasn't even at the Oscars. We're guessing the Home Alone actor wasn't invited to the big event but that didn't stop him from dressing up at home as if he was. He tweeted for seven hours - making a lot of jokes and quite a few digs at male stars tied to sexual harassment charges in the movie world. Praised as ""brilliantly cynical"" he likely gained a lot more followers but with lines like this we're not sure he'll be getting an invite to next year's award either.

"Morris wrote more than 40 books including a notable trilogy about Britain's empire, Pax Britannica, during the 1960s and 70s. In 1972, she transitioned from male to female, undergoing gender reassignment surgery and changing her name to Jan. Her son Twm announced her death, saying she was on her ""greatest journey"". ""This morning at 11.40 at Ysbyty Bryn Beryl, on the Llyn, the author and traveller Jan Morris began her greatest journey. She leaves behind on the shore her life-long partner, Elizabeth,"" he said. Elizabeth was Morris's wife before Morris transitioned - they had five children together and stayed together, later entering a civil partnership. One of their children died in infancy. Morris told Michael Palin in 2016: ""I've enjoyed my life very much, and I admire it. I think it has been a very good and interesting life and I've made a whole of it, quite deliberately. ""I've done all of my books to make one big, long autobiography. My life has been one whole self-centred exercise in self-satisfaction!"" She is arguably most famous for her widely admired travel writing, and Palin said: ""She's kind of a non-fiction novelist. She creates an image and a feeling of a place that stays in your mind."" Author Kate Mosse, whose books include Labyrinth, paid tribute to an ""extraordinary woman"". Fellow writer Sathnam Sanghera tweeted: ""What a life, and what a writer."" Journalist Katherine O'Donnell added her ""public visibility and account of her transition... let others like me know they were not alone"". Labour MP for Cardiff North Anna McMorrin added that Morris was ""an incredible writer, pioneer and historian"". Morris's book Venice, about the Italian city, is considered to be a classic by The Guardian. Palin said it was ""one of the most influential books of my life"". ""Her description of the city transcended any conventional travel writing I've come across. Morris's heart and soul was in the book. It was like a love affair,"" he said. ""Her book started my own love affair with the city, which has lasted all my life. And as a writer she taught me the importance of curiosity and observation."" The author also wrote fiction, however, and her book Last Letters from Hav made the Booker Prize shortlist in 1985. It was a novel written in the form of travel literature. Morris was particularly renowned as a journalist for announcing the ascent of Everest, in an exclusive scoop for The Times in 1953. 'Powerful and beautifully written' She accompanied Edmund Hillary as far as the base camp on the mountain, to witness the historic attempt on the summit. The news was announced on the same day as the Queen Elizabeth's coronation. Later, in 1999, she accepted a CBE from the Queen, but said it was out of politeness. Morris wrote about her transition in her 1974 book Conundrum, which was hugely successful. She wrote in the book about having surgery in a clinic in Casablanca. The Guardian described it as a ""powerful and beautifully written document"". The writer told the Financial Times in 2018 she did not think her gender reassignment had changed her her writing, saying: ""Not in the slightest. It changed me far less than I thought it had."" She added that she did not think she would have achieved more as a man. When not abroad, her home was in Gwynedd in Wales, where she held staunchly nationalist views and was honoured by the Eisteddfod for her contribution to Welsh life.

It also features an appearance by King George III, who was on the throne when America declared independence in 1776. Miranda said he was excited to see how the comedic portrayal of George III would be received in the UK. He said: ""King George III is a crowd favourite with every actor, every rapper. When Busta Rhymes saw the show he said 'I need that outfit.'"" He added: ""I'm very curious to see how you guys react to King George III in the show. That theatre is in the shadow of Buckingham Palace so I'm very curious to see how that goes over.""

Rock the Kasbah sees Murray as a washed up music manager stranded in Afghanistan - it also starred Bruce Willis, Kate Hudson and Zooey Deschanel. Forbes estimated it only made $2.87m (£1.9m) at the box-office but cost $15m (£9.95m) to make. In second place is hitman drama The Gunman starring and co-written by Sean Penn. It made $10.7m (£7.10m) in ticket sales after costing a reported $40m (£26.5m) to make. Both big and small budget films made the list. Fairytale Pan and Disney fantasy Tomorrowland were both big budget disappointments at the box office. Clooney could not save the Disney film which made $190m (£126.1m) at the box-office, but was made on a budget of $209.m (£138.7m). The Neverland 3D-fantasy film Pan failed to top the US box office when it was released despite massive promotion.

It cost a reputed $150m (£99.6m) to make and only made $119.8m (£79.5m) at the box office - this placed it eleventh on the Forbes list. On the other end of the scale, We Are Your Friends, which starred Zac Efron as an EDM DJ, was made for just $6m (£2.39m) - but only made $3.6m (£3.9m) at the box office. These figures placed it in eighth place. 'Ridiculous' Despite Cameron Crowe's stellar cast for Aloha, which included Bradley Cooper and Emma Stone, the film is in ninth place. The film was in the spotlight after leaked emails from Sony Pictures Entertainment co-chair Amy Pascal said its script was ""ridiculous"". It was also criticised after Stone, who has blonde hair and green eyes, was cast as Allison Ng - a fighter pilot who was part-Chinese, part-Hawaiian and part-Swedish. One advocacy group called Aloha ""a whitewashed film"" that failed to portray the ethnic diversity of Hawaii. It cost $37m (£24.56m) to make but only made $26.3m (£17.46m).

"""It had to be a dame on this occasion,"" she told listeners. Ball has taken over from Chris Evans in the most listened-to slot on the UK airwaves. She began Monday's show with the words: ""Hello, my name is Zoe. How's your belly off for spots? Good morning Radio 2 superstar listeners, here we go."" The saying ""How's your belly off for spots?"" is an alternative way of asking: ""How are you?"" 'A refreshing change' - what the critics said The Daily Telegraph awarded the show four stars, with Charlotte Runcie writing: ""The really good news is that Ball was sparky and friendly, and not at all cheesy, braggy or shouty."" ""Her conspiratorial tone of voice made for a truly refreshing change from the louder Evans era. ""And, as the show drew to a close, I found myself thinking a welcome thought: actually, I haven't felt this at home on Radio 2 since the days of Wogan."" The Guardian's Mark Lawson said: ""Ball's pulse could almost be heard thumping under the opening link at 6.30am. But in the next three hours, she was confident without being cocky. ""The ghost of Wogan would surely have been nodding at his latest replacement's clear bright delight at being on air, and her easy rapport with the audience and interviewees.""

"By Natalie JamiesonBBC entertainment reporter Its TV rival The X Factor can silence any critics by simply whispering the words One Direction. The Voice happily shouts about Becky Hill, a semi-finalist from series one who had a number one with Oliver Heldens on the track Gecko (Overdrive). But Hill is not quite in the same league as 1D - yet. ""It (The Voice) might not be churning out superstars to bridge the gap until the next series,"" explains one of the show's coaches, Ricky Wilson, ""but I think that's a good thing. ""We're building careers, I think,"" he goes on, ""we're not building flash in the pans"" before hastily adding ""that's not at the detriment of anyone else by the way"". Jermain Jackman, 19, won The Voice in 2014 and while he put out an EP last September, his first full album isn't released until March. ""It's that whole sense of working hard in silence and letting your success make the noise,"" Jackman explains. He says he's been surprised at the amount of creative freedom he's been given on his debut, but is he prepared to be criticised if he doesn't get a number one with this first release? ""I don't like that,"" he admits. ""People can put a lot of pressure on you,"" Jackman adds, ""but I'm not pressured, Amy Winehouse never had a number one but look how successful she was.""

So does will.i.am think it's fair to measure the success of a TV talent show on hit singles it produces from its contestants? ""Whether or not you have a massive hit after the show, shucks,"" he shrugs. ""As artists we're worried about our hits too! Everybody is worried about a hit."" One issue The Voice has had to confront from the outset, is that despite the show's name and its wholesome intentions, creating successful acts has a lot to do with image and branding as well. Coach Tom Jones says that has always been the case: ""When I first came to London from Cardiff in 1964, they said curly hair doesn't work anymore,"" he explains, bemused. ""I said, 'Wait a minute you haven't heard me sing yet,' and they said, 'Yeah but the Beatles and the Stones, you know, you're not boyish enough,' even though I was the same age as John Lennon. ""So you're told because you don't look right for the time,"" Sir Tom concludes, ""that you won't make it."" One Delilah and a Green, Green Grass of Home later and the question of his curly hair no doubt had become irrelevant. Rita Ora is the newcomer to the coaching panel this year, replacing Kylie Minogue, who replaced Jessie J. It wasn't a decision she took lightly. ""I had to speak to will (i.am) about it first,"" Ora says ""because I didn't know if I wanted to take that pressure on and be responsible"". It means Ora could find herself responsible for mentoring this year's winner, who, with any luck, will be as philosophical about making it in the music industry as Jermain Jackman. ""These things take time and care,"" Jackman considers, ""and I'm grateful to understand that, one step at a time."" The Voice series four starts on BBC1 at 19:00 on 10 January 2015.","It's not a new question, but it is one to which the BBC's prime time Saturday night offering The Voice has long been subjected: When is the show going to produce a superstar?"
"The Recuyell of the Histories of Troye is a version of a French book written around 1463. It was translated over a three-year period by William Caxton, who pioneered the printing press in England. He published his version around 1474, at a time when when most books were printed in Latin, in either Ghent or Bruges, Belgium. The story is an epic romance which portrays the heroes of Greek mythology as chivalric figures, according to Sotheby's, which auctioned it. It was produced as a gift for the Duke of Burgundy's new wife Margaret - the sister of the English King, Edward IV. The book was offered for auction by the Duke of Northumberland, who has been selling off dozens of family heirlooms after his estate was left with a massive bill for flood damage. Last week, £32m of sculptures, ceramics, paintings and furniture were offloaded. A 1st Century Roman marble statue of Aphrodite - the Greek goddess of love - fetched £9.4m alone. The sale was prompted by floods at Newburn, Newcastle, in 2012, during which a culvert collapsed and led to buildings being demolished. Bidding war The guide price going into the auction was £600,000 for a volume that is one of only 18 surviving copies. But a bidding war between three rivals pushed the auction up to a hammer price of £900,000, with the buyer paying £1,082,500 after the Sotheby's added its commission. Sotheby's books specialist Gabriel Heaton said the work marked ""a watershed moment in literary history when 'the father of English printing', William Caxton, embarked on the radical commercial decision to print the first book in English"". ""Produced at a time when printing in the vernacular was still in its infancy, and when there was a relatively small domestic readership, this was a risky enterprise"", he added. The Recuyell of the Histories of Troye was the first book Caxton printed, and its production appeared to take its toll on a man who was a leading figure in the 15th Century English mercantile community. In the book's epilogue, Caxton said ""In the writing of the same my pen is worn, mine hand weary and not steadfast, mine eyes dimmed with overmuch looking on the white paper"".","A 540-year-old book, known as the first to be printed in the English language, has sold at auction for more than £1m."
"Sir Terry Wogan presented the six-hour fund-raiser, with Fearne Cotton, Tess Daly, Zoe Ball and Nick Grimshaw. Olympic ice dancers Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean went head to head in a special Strictly Come Dancing edition as the annual appeal got under way. The on-the-night total of over £31m raised surpassed last year's £26m. Fund-raising events have been taking place around the UK. Greatest hits Proceedings kicked off with a performance from the stars of West End musical Matilda. Torvill and Dean were were given high praise by Strictly judges Len Goodman, Bruno Tonioli and Darcey Bussell. On winning, Torvill said: ""I'm really thrilled but I have to say I want to share it with Chris. I'll have it six months and he can have it six months."" Comedian Harry Hill starred in a new version of A-ha's Take On Me video, with a host of guest appearances including the Hairy Bikers. Boyband JLS performed some of their greatest hits in EastEnders' Albert Square and there was a world exclusive preview of the 50th anniversary episode of Doctor Who. A nationwide choir of 1,500 schoolchildren performed Gary Barlow's composition Sing. The figure at the end of the telethon - which has been running annually since 1980 - far exceeded last year's on-the-night total and donations are expected to continue in the coming days. Sir Terry said it was a remarkable tribute to the generosity of the British people. ""It's hard for me to speak of it, absolutely brilliant,"" he said. ""It's been a staggering total, it's beyond our wildest dreams, over £31m for this country's disadvantaged children. I want to thank you, thank you so much for your contributions, thank you."" In the same week, the British public have donated £30m to the Disasters Emergency Committee appeal for aid after the devastating typhoon in the Philippines. Rickshaw challenge Fundraising efforts began in the build-up to the show. The One Show's Rickshaw Challenge kicked off in Northern Ireland on 8 November, with participants cycling day and night to reach London in time for Friday night's edition of the magazine programme. Host Alex Jones called it ""one of the toughest things I've ever done"" - but by Wednesday night the riders had already raised £514,832. BBC Radio 4 is auctioning off several prizes, including the chance to read the shipping forecast and the opportunity to sit in on the Today programme's editorial meeting. BBC Radio 3 has recorded two charity singles with the BBC Philharmonic and the Halle Orchestra. A female ensemble, conducted by Sian Edwards, has covered Little Mix's single Wings combining it with Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries. Their male counterparts have mixed One Direction's What Makes You Beautiful with Verdi's Anvil Chorus. Meanwhile, celebrities including Michelle Dockery, Fiona Bruce, Denise Lewis and Kimberley Walsh joined the public in a ""no make-up"" fundraising day last week.

Over the years, it has distributed more than £690m to charity projects around the country.","Doctor Who, JLS and the EastEnders cast were among the highlights of this year's BBC Children in Need, which beat last year's record money-raising total."
"The Jaws and Close Encounters director will begin shooting in early 2015. First published in 1982, the book tells of an orphaned girl named Sophie who is befriended one night by a kindly giant. According to the Roald Dahl Literary Estate, the film will be released in 2016 to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the author's birth. ""We are delighted that Steven Spielberg will bring his inventive genius to directing the story of The BFG,"" it said in a statement. The director will work from a screenplay by Melissa Mathison, who previously wrote the Oscar-nominated script for his 1982 hit E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. ""The BFG has enchanted families and their children for more than three decades,"" said Spielberg in a statement posted on the Roald Dahl website. ""We are honoured that the Roald Dahl estate has entrusted us with this classic story."" Frank Marshall will produce the film, while Michael Siegel and John Madden will serve as its executive producers. Spielberg, whose other films include Raiders of the Lost Ark and Schindler's List, has not directed a film since 2012's historical epic Lincoln. The 67-year-old is also producing a Cold War thriller with Tom Hanks that he may also direct. Dahl, who died in 1990 at the age of 74, considered The BFG one of his favourite books. Sir David Jason provided the voice of the title character in an animated version made by ITV in 1989.","Steven Spielberg is to go back behind the camera to direct a new film of The BFG, Roald Dahl's much-loved children's book about a ""Big Friendly Giant""."
"He will replace Jason Manford, who left the show in November after admitting to exchanging intimate text and Twitter messages with female fans. The married father-of-three had only been in the job four months, after replacing Daybreak's Adrian Chiles. Former Blue Peter presenter Baker, who starts on 14 February, said he was ""over the moon."" He has already hosted the show several times alongside regular host Alex Jones, both as a stand-in for Manford and while the show has been between presenters. ""The BBC has made everything possible for me so I can also continue presenting Countryfile,"" said Baker. ""It's the ideal combination for me and I can't wait to get started."" BBC One controller Danny Cohen said Baker was ""perfectly placed"" to present the programme, while Jones said he was ""fantastic to work with and the perfect choice."" Baker, who came second in this year's Strictly Come Dancing series, has spent the last few weeks on the Strictly tour. He won two TV Baftas during his seven years on Blue Peter.

"The third instalment starring Daniel Craig outperformed the $67.5m (£42m) US debut of 2008's Quantum of Solace, the franchise's previous best opening. Skyfall took over the top spot from Disney's animated comedy, Wreck-It Ralph, which earned $33.1m (£20.7m). In third place, Denzel Washington's Flight earned $15.1m (£9.4m). Skyfall was the weekend's only new wide release but Steven Spielberg's Lincoln had a huge start in a small number of cinemas. Starring Daniel Day-Lewis as the 16th President, it earned $900,000 (£566,000) in just 11 locations with average ticket sales of $81,818 (£51,501) per theatre. By comparison, Skyfall earned an average of $25,050 (£15,765) at each of the 3,505 locations at which it was screened. Skyfall has now earned $518.6m (£326.5m) worldwide since its release at the end of October. The 23rd Bond film also more than doubled the $40.8m (£25.6m) debut of Craig's first Bond movie in 2006, Casino Royale. Rory Bruer, head of distribution at Sony, which produces the Bond films along with MGM said: ""It's quite a testament to Bond, considering it's the 50th anniversary. ""What a great anniversary present,"" he added. Bond, one of Hollywood's most-enduring franchises debuted 50 years ago with Dr No and over the last two decades the films have earned an average of around $200m (£125m) each domestically in inflation-adjusted dollars. While Skyfall marks a new high for Bond's opening-weekend revenue, it is still a way off the biggest audiences 007 has ever drawn. Adjusted for inflation, Sean Connery's 1965 Bond adventure, Thunderball would have taken in an estimated $508m (£319.8m) domestically in today's dollars, while Goldfinger released in 1964 was close behind, earning $444m (£279m), according to box-office tracker Hollywood.com. It was an impressive weekend at the US box office with overall domestic revenues at $172m (£108m) - a 26% increase on the same weekend last year. So far this year, domestic revenues are at $9.1 billion (£5.7b), up 4.3% from 2011, according to Hollywood.com.",James Bond's Skyfall has taken a record $87.8m (£55m) in its opening weekend at the North American box office.
"""Terry was first of all an enormous enthusiast,"" Sir Michael told the BBC. ""He threw himself into things with such passion and such energy, and he really refused to take on things which didn't excite him and which didn't feel different from what else was around. ""Part of his warmth was his love of all sorts of things and comedies - he knew an awful lot about the silent film comedians. There were so many aspects to Terry, but I would say enthusiasm and passion were the two main words that described him best. ""We had some very strange and silly moments together over the years. He was a very keen cook and I remember one time he was shucking oysters at his home. He loved entertaining people, he was the most marvellous entertainer, but unfortunately he nearly cut his finger off. Blood was spurting out of his finger and we were sent down to the nearest hospital. ""Terry had to keep his finger above his head so we entered the hospital, myself and Terry, with his hand up in the air like he was permanently asking for permission to do something. As we walked through casualty everybody laughed, it was wonderful. They couldn't believe the Pythons had visited them in this miserable place. ""I loved writing with Terry because he was very creative. He had some wonderful ideas for characters, he was very funny, he was very good at plot. That was something I was less good at, and when we did the Ripping Yarns, Terry was the one who was very keen to give each story a meaning and a significance. ""He felt everything he did was somehow important and had to be thought about. That was our creative working relationship, and also we both enjoyed a pint - that was very nice and we had lovely times together. ""Another bizarre thing we did [came] when I was first writing with Terry. He lived down in Waterloo and they opened a new men's toilets on Lambeth Walk. Being a local celebrity, Terry was asked to be the first person to use them! ""So Terry and I went down to the new toilets on Lambeth Walk with the band playing behind us. The only other person with us was the Mayor of Lambeth. ""So we enjoyed life together. He was a terrific person to enjoy things with. He really did increase the value of almost everything you did. ""It was an awful form of dementia for someone who loved debating and cajoling and arguing and playing different characters, to be reduced to being able to say very few words, as he was over the last two or three years. ""I lived fairly nearby and I used to go see him quite a lot, and though his dementia was shutting him down there were little moments you absolutely treasured - maybe just a glance or a touch on the hand or something like that. ""Quite recently I went round with a book we'd written together, Dr Fegg's Encyclopaedia of All World Knowledge. I started reading a few little bits out of it and for the first time for a long time I heard real laughter, that little wispy laughter of Terry's. ""I thought that was a marvellously encouraging thing to happen, but what was best of all was that Terry was only laughing at the bits he'd written. I thought, that's defying dementia for you."" Sir Michael Palin was speaking on BBC Radio Four's The World at One. Cleese described Jones as ""a man of so many talents"". ""He was a remarkable fellow because he had endless energy and enthusiasm. We used to laugh at him sometimes. I remember he got up one day when we were shooting on the south coast and he got excited about how green the grass was. ""So there was this hugely lively energy to him that was incredibly attractive. ""He also had a confidence that I rather envied. He'd take things on without any worry he might not do them terribly well. I'd always hold back, but I don't think Terry was ever assailed by those kind of doubts. He was a remarkable chap and had an enormous number of different talents - he was the most multi-talented [member] of the Pythons. ""He wrote a kind of sketch that was unlike what the rest of us wrote - for example, that wonderful sketch about the German joke that killed anyone who heard it. That was not something the rest of us could do. ""He used to [write] Icelandic sagas starting with some man heavily armoured in the tundra, or a long sketch about the Spanish smuggling pornography into Elizabethan England - much more visual, much longer sketches that were quite unlike what for example [Graham] Chapman and I were writing. ""He was also a very good director. How he shot Life of Brian really was masterful. If I had to give a class in how to shoot comedy, I would show that. ""I would say, 'Just look at how he uses the camera and how economic he is'. Sometimes he would leave the camera there and let the actors be funny, which is the kind of direction you never see now. I think Life of Brian was his masterpiece. ""We had many good times together - we used to go out for dinners and have a little too much wine. He loved reds and we both thought good food was more important than anything else. ""There was also a good atmosphere [though] much of the arguing would go on late into the evening. He didn't back off his arguments easily, but it was all part of this terrific energy and confidence. ""The last time I saw him was at the funeral of [former Play School presenter] Beryl Vosburgh [in 2016]. He sort of recognised me but there wasn't any kind of ordinary communication between us. ""I shall remember him as Mr Creosote. He is so funny in it and it's one of the funniest things we did. So I shall think of him exploding.""

"He posted on Instagram that he was ""put into situations that perpetuated the same racial stereotype"" and was treated differently from his white castmates. He spoke out at length after saying the show's official Instagram page started deleting his comments under a Black Lives Matter post. The show's spokeswoman said they had been ""concerned"" to read his comments. ""We got in touch with him yesterday evening in the hope we can discuss the issues he's raised at his earliest convenience,"" she added. Morgan, who was on the show from 2014 to 2018, added that he ""was almost never allowed to show any sides of my personality that wasn't angry, aggressive or negative"". He said he was told that he was the ""token representation of minority in our cast"" and was ""there to be paraded out as a symbol but never treated equally to the other cast members and despite having some of the most progressive and talked about scenes on the show, my story arc was never nurtured the way that my white counterparts were"". He felt ""guilty"" about not speaking out sooner but said the fear of being ""blacklisted"" from the industry held him back, he added. 'Oppressed and silenced' After Towie posted on Instagram in support of Black Lives Matter, he said he responded to racist replies, but his comments were deleted. ""At the time I was going to let this go but it's something that has been on my mind for the past few days,"" he wrote. ""Because it's tantamount to black voices being oppressed and silenced while they still left the racist comments. ""The incident was reminiscent of similar experiences while filming The Only Way Is Essex. ""While I have always been proud to be one of the only black and gay reality TV stars on British television, I have often felt conflicted over the way I was treated and the way I was portrayed.""

"Starring Breaking Bad's Bryan Cranston, Aaron Taylor Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen, it knocked last week's number one Bad Neighbours into second place. The Seth Rogan and Zac Efron comedy took £1.4m, while The Amazing Spider-Man 2 dropped into third place in its fifth week of release. Godzilla also topped the weekend's US box office with $93.2m (£55.4m). It marked the second biggest US opening of the year so far, beating the The Amazing Spider-Man 2's debut and landing just behind Captain America: The Winter Soldier, which took $95m (£56.4m) when it opened in April. Godzilla's UK opening coincided with one of the hottest weekends of the year so far, which could have contributed to the fact that it took less than Bad Neighbours' opening the previous weekend, at £8.4m. Cameron Diaz comedy The Other Woman was in fourth place at the UK box office this weekend. The Two Faces of January, starring Viggo Mortensen, Kirsten Dunst and Oscar Isaac, was the week's only other new release to make the top ten, taking £328,000.

"By James FitzgeraldBBC Minute BBC Minute's team - which provide 24/7 news bulletins for radio stations around the world - believe any challenge can be faced with the right music. We even have a motivational poster that reads: ""Make a coffee, put on some gangsta rap, and handle it."" It seems that's a view shared by our partner stations in 100 cities across 40 countries. We asked their presenters which songs they're playing to help their listeners get through the pandemic. Consider it your lockdown playlist. 1. Bop Daddy (Falz) - chosen by Ronke from Splash FM in Ibadan, Nigeria Many Nigerians are missing their nights out right now, if the #BopDaddyChallenge is anything to go by. It's a TikTok trend, Ronke explains. Those who would normally go to nightclubs have been taking to social media instead. They picture themselves transitioning from pyjamas into glamorous evening-wear - as if by magic. ""They're getting all made up… to go nowhere!"" she laughs. The soundtrack to the challenge is a tune by rapper-comedian Falz. ""It really is just a guy talking about himself, and how he's going to be your everything,"" says Ronke. ""The lyrics may not always make much sense, but the important thing is that it's fun to dance to while at home."" 2. Everything I Wanted (Billie Eilish) - chosen by Tebogo from Gabz FM in Gaborone, Botswana Billie Eilish's sombre song recounts a nightmare in which she takes her own life - but nobody cares. It's hardly music to blast away the lockdown blues. But news reporter Tebogo insists it's an apt choice for the present time, which is why Gabz FM has been playing it loads. ""It relates to the state of mind Botswana is in,"" he says. ""There's a bit of uncertainty. You're not sure where things are going to end up. But you have no choice other than to remain hopeful."" In her track, Eilish ultimately finds solace in those people closest to her, namely her brother Finneas. 3. Imagine (John Lennon) - chosen by Michael from Metro Plus in Hong Kong John Lennon's famous song appeals for unity and compassion. And Michael at Hong Kong's Metro Plus thinks people in Hong Kong are already showing each other more love than usual. ""You see a person without a mask by the roadside and someone will be giving him a helping hand. Before, they wouldn't have even looked at that guy,"" he says. ""This struggle is not between an Asian and an American, an American and a European, or a European and an African. ""Humans are up against something (coronavirus) we can't even see. If all we come together, as this song asks, we'll get through it."" 4. Mulk Kay Nojawano (traditional) - chosen by Asfandyar from Power 99 in Islamabad, Pakistan Asfandyar's tricky task is to create ""positive content"" during the pandemic. His team have chosen to rework a traditional song, which he says gives people courage. ""It makes them feel like defenders. They're an army. Why? Because they're staying home, keeping themselves and their families safe."" His playlists follow a daily rhythm. In the mornings, people want energetic pop to exercise to. By 5pm, it's time for something more reflective. ""That's when the sun sets, and we play songs like this to give them hope again for tomorrow. Music is the thing here which is calming people down."" 5. Par Pira (BeePee) - chosen by Okeng from Radio King in Gulu, Uganda Lockdown has made radio more crucial than ever in rural northern Uganda. Okeng's breakfast show has a feel-good feature in which the station calls up two people who want to connect with each other but lack the means (pay-as-you-go phone credit) - and it's proving popular with couples. As well as dating each other via radio, Gulu's young lovers are said to be coping with their new separation by requesting an elegant Afro-fusion love song by local artist BeePee. ""The song means, 'have me in your heart during the good times, but also the bad times',"" Okeng explains. 6. Quarantine Show (Dubioza Kolektiv) - chosen by Naida from Radio Antena in Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herzegovina Due to increased pressure on the internet, some of us are glad to just Skype a friend without having issues. But, miraculously, the seven members of Dubioza Kolektiv manage to use video-calling to jam out songs even while each musician stays at home. Radio Antena likes to play the best bits from these live sessions. ""Wash your hands!"" urges this eccentric (but informative) tune. Antena's mostly English-language playlist rarely gets more Balkan than the odd Dua Lipa track. But presenter Naida says the coronavirus has raised demand for Bosnian artists. ""People are listening to us all over the world. A lot of people left here during the [1992-95] war. Right now, they're missing home. They want to hear their language, and to know what's happening here."" 7. Resistiré 2020 (David Bisbal, Vanesa Martín, Alex Ubago, and others) - chosen by Valeria from Metropolis FM in Montevideo, Uruguay Recorded back in 1988, Resistiré has re-emerged as a defiant hymn, belted out from apartment balconies in virus-hit Spain. ""It's different to a song like [Gloria Gaynor's] I Will Survive,"" says Valeria at Metropolis FM. ""It's not about saying, 'I made it'. Instead it's about saying, 'I will fight this'."" A star-studded 2020 cover version has become her most requested song. Uruguay has not yet been badly hit by Covid-19, Valeria says, but people here are watching the rest of the world anxiously. ""A lot of them have relatives in Spain. Or they're terribly worried about family in the United States."" 8. Ride Natty Ride (Bob Marley) - chosen by Maya from Capital Radio in Khartoum, Sudan ""The stone that the builder refuse / Shall be the head cornerstone."" Maya loves these Bob Marley lyrics. She thinks they mean that every underdog will have its day. Protesters calling for political changes in Sudan in 2019 adopted the reggae icon as something of a ""freedom symbol"", and he remains popular with young artists and activists a year later. Many Sudanese continue to feel marginalised, Maya says. But now it's as a result of coronavirus restrictions, which could hit the country's poorest. So, she keeps playing Marley, ""no longer as a revolutionary voice, but as a calming father figure who says, 'you're going to get through this'"". 9. We Will Rock You (Queen) - chosen by Moustafa from Radio One in Baghdad, Iraq ""It's our anthem,"" says Moustafa of this 70s floor-stomper. ""Any time we face a challenge at the radio station, we have a saying: 'We will rock this; this is not a problem for us.' And the same thing goes for the listeners. Whenever they're feeling down, they always request We Will Rock You."" For Moustafa, lockdown is further proof of how radio offers young Iraqis an escape from their daily struggles. Turns out it's therapeutic for the DJ, too. ""Just as listeners tell me their problems, I tell them mine. So, it's back and forth, which is awesome."" 10. Rumah Kita (God Bless) - chosen by Hisa from Smart FM in Jakarta, Indonesia Translated as Our Home, this karaoke-ready tune has taken on a new meaning at Jakarta's Smart FM. Presenter Hisa is playing it for people who are ignoring social distancing restrictions. ""We want to invite them to stay at home and be observant of the rules,"" she explains. ""The song's message is all about how great Indonesia is: no matter where you go in the world, it's always more comfortable here. And, right now, it's best to stay not just in Indonesia, but in our homes."" No official video available.","With around half the world's population living under social distancing rules, many of us are turning to our favourite tunes for comfort. They're helping us to reflect, grieve or even dance around while we follow orders to stay at home."
"By Ian YoungsEntertainment & arts reporter ""There's lots of good fish in the sea... maybe,"" Lawrence wrote in Lady Chatterley's Lover. ""But the vast masses seem to be mackerel or herring, and if you're not mackerel or herring yourself you are likely to find very few good fish in the sea."" If only Lady Chatterley, in her search for the perfect catch, had been on Tinder. In the book, frustrated by her war-wounded, impotent husband Clifford, Connie Chatterley risked scandal by embarking on a steamy affair with their working class gamekeeper Oliver Mellors. Now, 90 years after the book was written, Lady Chatterley has turned to Tinder and been flirting with modern men. Sort of. Lady Chatterley's presence on Tinder has come courtesy of Libby Heaney, who has created a profile for the character and programmed a bot to chat with real men, using only lines from the book. She also created profiles for Clifford and Mellors. After around 800 conversations with real romance-seekers, the exchanges are part of an artwork called Lady Chatterley's Tinderbot, which will be exhibited for the first time in the UK at the Lowry arts centre in Salford from Saturday. Lady Chatterley's lines are in blue: Heaney said she was interested in exploring ""how Tinder changes how we interact with each other, and changes our views on dating and love and relationships and sex"". Her bot automatically swiped left or right on a person's profile and entered into conversations using the character's original dialogue. ""If Lady Chatterley is repeating the same types of conversations, you will always get some people who just ask for sex, you'll get some people who are really lonely, who seem nice, and some people who are really confused by the whole thing,"" Heaney says. A few Tinder users even worked out where the lines were from and replied using quotes themselves. Heaney used her own photo for Lady Chatterley's profile picture, and her boyfriend's photo for Clifford and Mellors. The Tinderbots used an algorithm to analyse the human's message and decide which quote to send in reply. ""If it sounds more positive, the bot will reply using a more positive message,"" Heaney says. ""And if it is more negative it will reply using a more negative message, but all still taken from the book."" The book was notorious for its language and was banned in the UK until an obscenity trial cleared it for publication in 1960. Some of the chat-up lines used by the bots included the explicit language. Heaney says there were other considerations. The bot only sent a maximum of three messages to any one person to avoid stringing them along. ""The person might keep replying after that. Some people replied 10 times after that. Obviously they really liked her or him."" The artist says she wanted to think about whether it's good that we're automating parts of our lives - and whether that might extend to things we think are very personal, like falling in love. ""In terms of thinking to the future and how we're automating different aspects of our lives, there's really a strong sense that we're going a bit too far, we're trying to automate our love lives,"" she says. The software she used was available to anyone. ""It does pose questions about how maybe we'll all have a robot at some point to act on our behalf,"" she says.

"By Ian YoungsEntertainment reporter ""It's going to be an absolute zoo on set, and I don't think anyone, including ourselves, is ready for what's going to happen."" Yasmin Evans is speaking less than two days away from co-presenting two hours of silly games, sillier sketches, celebrity interviews, viewer phone-ins and cartoons on Saturday Mash-Up! on BBC Two and CBBC. With a script on the table in front of her but without a full rehearsal until the day before she and co-host Jonny Nelson go live, the pair are dizzy with seat-of-your-pants anticipation. ""Being too prepared, especially when it's a live show - I don't think that's the right way to do it,"" Evans says. ""Well it had better not be, because I'm not!"" As the BBC 1Xtra DJ and soon-to-be children's TV star lists the features that will be in Saturday Mash-Up!, Nelson chips in with an essential ingredient: ""Anarchy."" ""Anarchy,"" Evans repeats, before adding: ""A lot of gunge."" If that formula sounds familiar, you're probably old enough to fondly remember Saturday morning TV of yesteryear - from Multi-Coloured Swap Shop through Saturday Superstore, Going Live, Live & Kicking, The Saturday Show, Dick and Dom in Da Bungalow and TMi. ITV went from Tiswas to SM:TV Live via the Wide Awake Club, but it's a decade since the Saturday morning zoo TV format was finally abandoned. ""I like the anarchy thing,"" Nelson continues. ""Because it's live, and event-type TV hasn't been done for so long. Not like this. I think it's going to give them [the viewers] something very different to what they're used to."" Classic BBC Saturday morning children's TV The Multi-Coloured Swap Shop (1976-82) Saturday Superstore (1982-87) Going Live (1987-93) Live & Kicking (1993-2001) The Saturday Show (2001-05) Dick and Dom in Da Bungalow (2003-06) TMi (2006-09) There is one presenter missing from our interview - Hacker T Dog, who Evans and Nelson admit is more experienced than both of them, and who is likely to provide the biggest dose of anarchy. Before Hacker T Dog, there was Going Live's Gordon the Gopher and of course Spit the Dog from Tiswas, and the new show unashamedly harks back to what made those older shows so well-loved. The first thing Evans did when she found out she got the presenting job, she says, was to turn to YouTube to watch 45 minutes of Wonky Donkey - Ant and Dec's crazed phone-in game show from SM:TV. Evans says the new show will have a game that she describes with some pride as ""Wonky Donkeyesque"". For Nelson, he went back and watched lots of Live and Kicking, whose host pairings included Jamie Theakston and Zoe Ball, which he said ""got me excited, but it also made me understand the scale of how important this is"". With hours to fill with riotous games and unpredictable guests and callers, the best bits often came when things didn't go to plan and the presenters had to somehow muddle through while attempting to suppress laughter. ""Those are the elements that we remember certainly from our childhoods,"" Nelson says. ""A lot of the time you tuned in because it was going to be mad. ""You didn't know what Jamie Theakston, Zoe Ball or Ant and Dec were going to do on that morning - who was going to make the other one laugh, or who was going to get their lines wrong, or what bit of the set's going to fall down, or what someone on the phone's going to say. ""I think the second the first thing goes wrong on the show and we style it out, God willing, that's going to be quite a relief."" Evans and Nelson may not have had much rehearsal time, but they do already have the warmth of old friends, and with their infectious mix of nerves and enthusiasm it's not hard to imagine one or both dissolving into giggles as another piece of the set topples over. But can the formula appeal to a young generation of viewers? The reason that was always given for the disappearance of live Saturday morning TV was that kids today have so many other channels to choose from, and so many devices, so it could no longer be the focal point that it once was. Phillip Schofield, who was Going Live!'s ringmaster in the late 1980s and early 90s, recently told BBC 5 live that if they tried to do the same programme today it would make for ""a very different show"". ""It would be a lot faster, it would be a lot cooler, it would be absolutely alive with social platforms,"" he said on 5 Live's I Was There. ""If I'm honest, I'm very glad that that was my time because I still think of those as the glory days of TV, when there were less channels, and people had more time, and they were less likely to get bored, and they'd give you the benefit of doubt on something but stick with you. ""It was harder to click off and click on to something else. The pressure I think would be immense now."" Saturday Mash-Up!'s hosts and producer stress that they are bringing the format up to date - taking some ideas from the heyday and adapting them for the pace and technology of modern life. ""Television as a whole is a lot faster than it was 20 or 30 years ago,"" says series producer Jamie Wilson. ""Life is faster isn't it? ""An interview on Going Live might have been 12 minutes, whereas an interview on our show might be four minutes or five at a push."" Some ideas haven't grown old, though. ""I think the idea of phoning in and chatting to your idol is just as exciting now,"" Wilson says. ""There are some really timeless ideas within those old formats that we're keen on, but there's a big dose of new stuff, like the digital interaction that just didn't exist in the 80s and 90s."" He rightly points out that, in today's fragmented media market, live event shows like Strictly Come Dancing and Ant and Dec's Saturday Night Take Away have managed to remain some of the biggest fixtures on TV. ""Saturday mornings always had that kind of feel,"" Wilson says. ""There's something for everyone, and it was a real 'in the moment', live, exciting place to be. ""So I'm not sure why it went away in the first place, but it definitely felt it was just as relevant, and will hopefully be just as entertaining now.""

"Eclipsed is a hard-hitting drama about women captured and raped by a Liberian rebel officer. The sell-out play marked the 12 Years a Slave and Star Wars star's stage debut when opening earlier this year. Gurira, who plays Michonne in huge TV hit The Walking Dead, is the award-winning writer of four plays. BBC Entertainment Live: News updates Eclipsed is considered notable as a rare production written by a woman to get a spot on Broadway. There has been only one other this current season, an adaptation of Emile Zola's horror story Therese Raquin, written by the British playwright Helen Edmundson. Eclipsed also stands out for dealing with the difficult subject matter of rape in Africa. The last play to cover the issue was Ruined in 2009, although it was controversially not granted a Broadway run despite its success. Ethnically diverse Oskar Eustis, the artistic director of the off-Broadway Public Theatre, where Eclipsed is currently running, told the New York Times he hoped its main stage run would ""break a barrier that will stay broken"". ""It's an incredibly emotional play and by the end very deeply touching and harrowing, and yet Danai has written it so beautifully it ultimately feels life-affirming, about how women in horrible circumstances are able to find their own agency."" Zimbabwean-American Gurira's other plays are In the Continuum, The Convert and Familiar, which also deal with female identity and race. Nyong'o, who was born in Mexico and raised in Kenya, became an overnight star with her performance in 12 Years a Slave, winning last year's best supporting actress Academy Award. 'Healthy for Broadway' They are part of an ethnically diverse production team which African-American producer Stephen Byrd says is also rare. ""There's a market out there that has not really been addressed with plays that can draw a cross-section of people to theatre,"" Byrd said. ""It's going to be an interesting season, and it's very healthy for Broadway."" Eclipsed finishes at the Public Theatre on 29 November and begins previews at Broadway's John Golden Theatre on 23 February, Hollywood Reporter said. Its official opening will be on 6 March.","Oscar-winning actress Lupita Nyong'o is to star on Broadway in Eclipsed, a play written by Walking Dead actress Danai Gurira, according to reports."
"Writing on Twitter, he blamed ""technical issues"" for the 49-minute delay on Monday. ""Last night I was scheduled after 3 opening acts to go on stage at 935 not 830 but because of some technical issues I got on at 10:10,"" he wrote. ""There is no excuse and I apologise for anyone we upset. However it was great show and I'm proud of that."" Initial reports suggested he was almost two hours late on stage. ""I never have any intent to upset or let anyone down. And I'm not okay with things being exaggerated. Once again sorry for anyone upset,"" added the singer. A spokesman for The O2 said promoters have been asked to explain why the pop star was late. He confirmed refunds would be dealt with by the arena's operators, AEG Live ""on a case by case basis dependent on the credibility of the claim"". There was confusion over what time Bieber was due on stage, with The O2 saying on Tuesday the 19-year-old was scheduled to appear at 21:30, following performances from three support acts, including Carly Rae Jepsen and Cody Simpson. Fans who began arriving for the sold-out concert when the doors opened at 18:30 GMT said on Twitter there were boos from some people in the crowd almost an hour before he emerged. Louise Collier from Bexleyheath, Kent, said she expected Bieber to start ""somewhere between 8pm and 9pm"". ""I knew there were a couple of support acts, so from experience, I expected him to be on stage about 9pm,"" she said. Mrs Collier took her daughter to the concert for her birthday. She paid £120 for two tickets but said: ""There's no way I would have let her go if I knew it was going to be that late."" ""She enjoyed it - but a definite shine has been taken off it and if she wants to see him again, she will have to save up and pay for the tickets herself as I won't be paying. ""My daughter was very disappointed as he played a much shorter set and there was obviously an awful lot of songs missing. I think he was on stage for only an hour."" It is not the first time Bieber has appeared late on stage - he kept fans in Nottingham waiting for an hour on Saturday, eventually beginning his show at 22:00 and ending at 23:40. As fans waited for Bieber to arrive on stage at The O2 on Monday, the arena's house disc jockey played a selection of songs. Speaking outside the venue, one fan said: ""They were playing Michael Jackson song, after song, after song - it was so annoying. ""Everyone was on edge and as more time passed, everyone was getting more worried and booing."" Richard Hayward from Folkestone, Kent, took his 15-year-old daughter and her two friends, but they only saw 15 minutes of Bieber's performance as they had to get the last train back to Swindon. ""When I found my daughter she was completely distraught in floods of tears,"" he said. ""One of her friends was exactly the same. The other was just livid with anger. ""Irrespective of what's gone on she still sees herself as his number one fan. If we'd known at the outset that it was going to finish at that time there's no way we could have gone,"" he added. Bieber will perform three more concerts at The O2, including Tuesday 5, Thursday 7 and Friday 8 March. Earlier, the O2 replied to a fan on Twitter saying the venue would be doing ""everything within our power to ensure Justin makes it on stage at the right time"" for Tuesday's performance. It later added: ""We have been informed by the @justinbieber team that he is scheduled to go on stage at 9pm tonight. Support acts start from 7pm.""

"The show has featured guest stars such as Christie Brinkley, Brooke Shields, David Hasselhoff and Ugly Betty's America Ferrara. The curtain will fall on its final London performance on 1 September, after taking more than £120m at the West End box office. Chicago was also made into an Oscar-winning film in 2002. Barry Weissler, who along with wife Fran produced the show on Broadway and around the world, said bringing the production to the West End was a ""pivotal moment"" in their career. ""Running 15 years has been a dream come true,"" he added. ""We may be taking our parting shots for now, but the Razzle Dazzle will never fade."" Currently at the Garrick Theatre, the show holds the record as the West End's longest-running revival. It opened in November 1997 with Ruthie Henshall, Ute Lemper, Henry Goodman and Nigel Planer in the main roles. On Twitter Henshall said she was sad to hear the show was closing. She wrote: ""I have amazing memories of the best female roles in musical theatre. Truly blessed to have been a part of it"".

When it returns, episodes will be 10 minutes shorter, though the show will air four times a week once again. At present, EastEnders has been shown only twice a week, to help producers fill the gap. ""Resuming production is incredibly exciting and challenging in equal measure,"" executive producer Jon Sen said. ""Since we postponed filming we've been working non-stop trialling techniques, filming methods and new ways of working so that we can return to screens four times a week - as EastEnders should be."" He added: ""Filming will inevitably be a more complex process now, so creating 20-minute episodes will enable us to ensure that when we return, EastEnders will still be the show the audience know and love."" Once the show goes off-air after next week, classic episodes will be re-run, and a regular new spin-off featuring Stacey Dooley will be broadcast from 22 June.

"By Ian YoungsArts reporter, BBC News Burgess' operatic reimagining of his famous novel was composed 26 years ago, but the tunes had remained unheard. Tenor Timothy Langston played gang leader Alex, accompanied by bowler hat-wearing members of Manchester Chamber Choir as his ""droog"" accomplices. Together, they sang songs about their ""ultra-violence"" and ""the old in-out"". Burgess' tunes, informed by Beethoven as well as classic musicals like West Side Story, feature lyrics written in the Russian-influenced argot invented by the author for his teenage anti-heroes. The opening song uses one of the novel's recurring phrases, ""What's it gonna be then, eh?"", as its chorus. Another, depicting the authorities' over-zealous attempts at a cure, begins with a bellicose chant: ""Discipline, discipline, let's have discipline, give him a haircut and shave."" Burgess composed a ""play with music"" to reassert ownership over his story after it was overshadowed by director Stanley Kubrick's controversial 1971 film. The script has been performed before, notably by the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) in 1990 - but they enlisted Bono and The Edge of U2 to compose new songs rather than use Burgess' compositions. Burgess, who died in 1993, wrote 33 novels, but once said he wanted to be known as ""a musician who writes novels, instead of a novelist who writes music on the side"". Dr Andrew Biswell, director of the International Anthony Burgess Foundation in Manchester, where the performance took place, said the songs had not previously been aired in the UK because there was a ""distrust of his music among professional musicians"". ""He wasn't one of them,"" he said. ""He wasn't formally trained. When the RSC did their production of the play, they wanted musicians you've heard of."" Dr Biswell said there was ""every chance"" Burgess' music would now be used in a fully staged production. ""Now the music's been properly edited and typeset, it becomes usable for other people,"" he said. ""I'd never heard all of the music so this has been a revelation to me. I'd known the play for more than 20 years but suddenly this makes sense of the play for me."" The play differs significantly from the book and subsequent film, he said. 'More conventional' ""It becomes a love story. Alex acquires a girlfriend and intends to get married at the end of the play, and that love interest isn't there in the novel, and certainly not in the film. So, in many ways, it's a much more conventional theatrical happy ending. ""I think the reason he adapted this for the stage and wrote his own music was to reassert authorship over the story post-Kubrick. But also I think he got quite tired of the way the book and the film were talked about as products of violence. ""There had been a very dry, academic debate about violence, and the thing everybody had forgotten is that the novel he'd written is, in many respects, a comic novel. ""Burgess, in putting it on the stage, found an opportunity, not just to adapt, but to revise and reimagine and turn it into something new, and something that's meant to entertain. ""People don't go to the theatre because they want to see people being raped and murdered. There has to be something else. So adapting the story for the theatre gave him the chance to change the tone of it completely."" The performance was part of a conference to mark the book's 50th anniversary.",Songs written by A Clockwork Orange author Anthony Burgess for a musical version of his novel have been performed in the UK for the first time.

However, he indicated that theatre audiences were not drawn from the usual overseas summer visitors - with most patrons coming from the UK instead. ""They do appear to be mainly British,"" he told the BBC. ""A lot of people are coming to London and saying 'let's take in a show too', which is great.

"By Vincent Dowd Arts correspondent, BBC World Service Jeremy Thomas is one of Britain's most successful independent movie producers. His hits have included The Last Emperor and Sexy Beast. But he says he's never laboured at a film as long as Kon-Tiki, which is getting its international premiere in Toronto on Friday. ""It's hard to explain quite how famous Thor Heyerdahl and his raft Kon-Tiki were when I was growing up in the 50s and 60s,"" he says. ""But for a long time it never really occurred to me to try to make a film of his fantastic adventure."" In 1947, Thor Heyerdahl sailed from Peru to the Polynesian islands on a simple balsa wood raft. He wanted to show the voyage would have been possible centuries before with the simple technology then available, disproving the assumption that Polynesia was settled from Asia. Most anthropologists disagreed with Heyerdahl's thesis then... And they still do. But it wasn't really the anthropology which fascinated millions of people around the world - it was the adventure. Thor Heyerdahl's account of the perilous voyage became a best-seller and a documentary film of the expedition won a Oscar in 1951. The young Jeremy Thomas was among those gripped by a story which could have been written by Jules Verne. ""In 1996 my friend Michael Douglas suddenly mentioned Heyerdahl out of the blue,"" says Thomas. ""Michael wasn't even sure I'd have heard of him but I explained that I'd grown up with Heyerdahl as a hero. For people of my generation Kon-Tiki was an exciting story. Then Michael told me Heyerdahl's publisher was looking for a film deal. So I went to Tenerife to talk to Thor Heyerdahl."" It's taken Jeremy Thomas sixteen years and at least five screenplays to make the movie. Well-known writers came and went. ""Initially I thought this would be an $80m (£63.4m) Hollywood movie,"" he says, ""and at one point I was sure Leonardo DiCaprio would make a great Heyerdahl. But about three years ago production went up a gear and now we have a different kind of film."" Thomas acknowledges that production grew easier after Heyerdahl's death in 2002 at the age of 87. ""He was a hugely charismatic man who had achieved a lot: He had massive energy even in old age. But he wanted a movie which told his whole life story. That was impossible in dramatic terms."" Thomas says new film technology means the movie is better than it would have been in 1996. ""CGI helped a lot, making the Pacific and its sea-life a more exciting part of the story. ""The truth is that often large stretches of water can look flat on camera - computers get round that problem."" A selection of sharks provide some of the story's highpoints, though the producer insists very little has been invented. A private man Kon-Tiki, already a hit in Norway, is directed by Norwegians Joachim Roenning and Espen Sandberg, who take a joint credit behind the camera. Their previous film was Max Manus in 2008. This film is one third in English (including sequences set in the US) and two-thirds in Norwegian, with subtitles. But alternative takes in English exist for all scenes, if that's ultimately what the market demands. As played convincingly by actor Pal Sverre Hagen, the film portrays Heyerdahl as driven but essentially likeable. Roenning says the explorer was a complex person. ""I suspect Thor Heyerdahl was a very private man, even though he was constantly being interviewed and photographed. I think maybe he was a lonely man too. He came from a small town south of Oslo called Larvik, which is very near where Espen and I grew up. ""His family was prosperous but he felt he had to escape his small-town background - which is pretty much what Espen and I felt too."" Sandberg thinks Heyerdahl was always looking for a calling: ""He wanted to find a purpose in life. ""Sometimes people forget that he worked on his theories for 10 years before the Kon-Tiki expedition and he went on exploring and researching for the rest of his life."" Kon-Tiki is the biggest project ever for Scandinavian cinema and it proves the country can do more than moody crime dramas. It was shot in Norway, Sweden, Malta, Bulgaria, Thailand and the Maldives. In Scandinavia, Heyerdahl remains famous but the rest of the world now remembers him less than it did. Yet Sandberg is certain the story has universal resonance. ""He's an inspiring figure because all of us want adventure in our lives. It's amazing what you can do if you face down your fears. ""You know, Thor Heyerdahl couldn't even swim but he spent 101 days on a raft crossing the Pacific. It's the ultimate adventure story."" Kon-Tiki will be shown at the Toronto International Film Festival on Friday, 7 September.","In 1947 the Norwegian explorer Thor Heyerdahl led a six-man expedition more than 4,000 miles across the Pacific. He wanted to prove a scientific theory - but what caught the public imagination was that the men set sail on the Kon-Tiki, a primitive raft whose flimsiness some said made the voyage suicidal. Now the story has been dramatised for a movie, which is being launched at the Toronto Film Festival this week."

""I would never do it,"" agrees Swedish star Zara Larsson, speaking at the BBC Music Awards. ""A lot of artists out there have been very pro-Hillary and anti-Donald. So I would never do it and most other smart people wouldn't do it."" Despite their reservations, Trump's campaign appeared to have scored a victory last month, when they announced one A-list star would be taking part in the celebrations. ""Elton John is going to be doing our concert on the mall,"" said Anthony Scaramucci, a member of the presidential inaugural committee, claiming that Mr Trump would be the first president to enter the White House with a pro-gay stance. But almost as soon as the comments were made, Sir Elton issued a strongly-worded rebuttal. ""Incorrect. He will NOT be performing,"" wrote his publicist, making liberal use of the caps lock key. ""There is no truth in this at all."" Kanye West said he would have voted for Trump, if he had voted - and met the president elect on the morning of 13 December. Following the meeting, the pair refused to discuss the inauguration. Mr Trump said they were ""just friends"". Other names bandied around have been lower-profile - from rap-rock rascal Kid Rock to Achy Breaky country star Billy Ray Cyrus. However, The Wrap claims Trump's team is still holding out for a Bruno Mars or Justin Timberlake. The situation has become so critical that they are allegedly breaking with protocol to offer artists an appearance fee. ""They are willing to pay anything,"" said their source, suggesting that a six-figure sum would be within reach. This has been flatly denied by the spokesman for the Presidential Inaugural Committee, Boris Epshteyn, who said ""no one with any official position at, or official relationship with, the presidential committee is engaging in the conduct described"". But even if a fee was offered - would anyone accept? ""I don't think I would take the money on that one,"" says US pop star Adam Lambert, the part-time frontman of Queen, who is a passionate advocate for LGBTQ rights. ""I don't think I'd be endorsing that. They might struggle."" Rick Astley, the 80s pop legend who is currently enjoying an unexpected career resurgence, is less forthright. ""Depends how big the cheque was!"" he laughs, before expressing reservations about Trump's presidency. ""Politically, the whole world's been shaken this year - and that was the icing on the cake,"" he says. ""But whether it was Donald Trump or anybody else, I'm not sure I'd want to go and play at the inauguration of an American president. I don't think that's a place for a British artist to be, to be honest."" One exception could be Matt Goss - the former Bros frontman, who has had a successful second career with his Las Vegas residency. But despite holding an honorary captaincy in the US Army - making Trump his incoming commander-in-chief - Goss says he'll give the inauguration a miss. ""I'm very proud that I live there and proud of my residency in Vegas but, politics aside, I wasn't impressed by the lack of civility. I would bow out of that one gracefully."" Then, just as it seems no-one in the music world harbours a secret ambition to play for the president elect, we bump into Matt Healy, lead singer of The 1975. Yes, he says, he would sing at the inauguration… but on one condition. ""I'll do it if they give me cash up front,"" he says. ""Then watch what would happen. It would be a riot."" So what's his price? ""What do I want? Well, he's got gold seatbelts in his plane - so at least a million quid."" Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

"By David SillitoMedia Correspondent The channel will continue in a truncated form on the iPlayer, while some of its more popular programmes could transfer to BBC One and Two. Overall, its programme budget will be cut from the current £85m to £25m. The closure will make way for an extension of CBBC's broadcasting hours, and a BBC One + 1 channel. Why did the BBC need to close a channel? The BBC is in the midst of making cuts of £700m. The director general, Tony Hall, says the latest round of £100m of savings offered a choice: He could either continue to hack away at budgets, which would reduce the quality of many BBC services, or amputate something completely. He chose the latter. The main justification is that he wanted to protect BBC One's drama budget and £30m of the BBC Three savings will go towards drama. Is it a risk to move BBC Three content onto the iPlayer? BBC Three is aimed at young people and young people are increasingly watching TV content online. The market is also changing rapidly with Amazon and Netflix reflecting a new culture of ""TV on demand"". However, at the moment the iPlayer makes up about 4% of BBC Three's total viewing figures. One problem is that popular imported series such as Family Guy and American Dad are not available online. Ignore those series and iPlayer viewing goes up to 8%. The BBC believes that figure will grow significantly in the next few years. The other problem is that having BBC Three on Freeview, satellite and cable drives demand for the iPlayer - which many people use to catch up on episodes they have missed. A channel that prides itself on new, innovative and challenging shows may struggle in a world in which you no longer stumble across content that ""happens to be on"". Will it actually happen? BBC Three is due to close in Autumn 2015. Before that there will be six months of consultations and the BBC Trust - which represents the interests of licence fee payers - will have to decide if it can go ahead. There are already public protests about the decision to close BBC Three and, in recent history, such campaigns have forced the BBC to reverse plans to close other services. Radio station 6 Music was earmarked for closure and then reprieved - since when it has doubled its listenership. Why BBC Three and not BBC Four? When it comes to watching via the iPlayer, BBC Three's younger audience is thought to be more likely to look for it online than BBC Four's older viewers. BBC Three's budget is also bigger than BBC Four's, so there are bigger savings to be made. Additionally, BBC Four's highbrow and more earnest content also looks to many like traditional ""public service broadcasting"". Some of BBC Three's provocative programme titles and American cartoons have attracted criticism. The problem for the BBC is that Three is viewed by 16 million people a week and they tend to be people the rest of the corporation struggles to reach - the young, the less affluent and more ethnically diverse. What will happen to new comedy? BBC Three broadcasts more than 1,000 hours of comedy a year, more than the rest of BBC TV combined. However, while it has been a successful proving ground for new talent not all of its hits started on BBC Three. Little Britain, for example, began on BBC Radio 4 (the same can be said for many successful TV shows on a variety of channels, of course). There will still be around £25m to £30m for new productions and the money can be focussed on more popular programmes, rather than having to fill airtime. This is a big cut from BBC Three's current content budget of £85 million. But these productions will be guaranteed airtime on BBC One and BBC Two (most will go out at night, after 22:35 GMT). Are there more cuts to come? Yes. Today accounts for just £50m of the planned £100m cuts. Expect further announcements in the coming weeks. Speaking on Thursday, the BBC's director of television, Danny Cohen, even refused to rule out the possibility of closing another channel, saying: ""We don't know for certain what will happen for BBC Four in the future. ""We can't keep offering the same with less money. ""If future funding for the BBC comes under threat, the likelihood is we would have to take more services along the same route.""","The BBC has announced sweeping changes to youth channel BBC Three, which will disappear from the EPG in autumn 2015."
"By Colin PatersonEntertainment correspondent Barlow is using Let It Shine, which starts on Saturday, to find the five leads for a Take That stage musical. Let It Shine will go up against The Voice UK, which has moved to ITV. Barlow told the BBC: ""I think people are ingesting TV in a different way now. That old system of ratings shouldn't really apply any more."" Speaking on the set of the show, the Take That star added: ""But I think people are still loving, downloading and buying music and listening to music more importantly. ""And I think people are ready for a new Saturday night experience."" The eight-week show will be hosted by Mel Giedroyc and Graham Norton, while Barlow will act as a judge alongside Dannii Minogue, Spandau Ballet's Martin Kemp and Glee star Amber Riley. The winners will tour the UK with the new musical for a year. Audiences for TV singing contests have been in decline for a number of years. December's The X Factor final was the least watched in the show's history and lost out in the ratings to BBC One's Planet Earth II, which was shown at the same time. The Voice UK, also had its smallest ever audience for a final last April, with 4.5 million watching, compared with 6.3 million the previous year. However, Barlow, who was a judge on The X Factor for three series, said there was demand for another TV singing show. ""I think it's incredibly exciting,"" he said. ""It's something I haven't done before. I've done lots of things in my career. But this feels like something new. ""And I have to say I think Saturday night needs a new idea at the moment. And I think this could be it."" Let It Shine is filling the BBC One Saturday night slot that was vacated by The Voice UK's move to ITV. ITV has reinstated Sir Tom Jones as a coach on The Voice UK, two years after he was sacked by the BBC. The BBC showed the first five series of The Voice UK. Both shows start on Saturday and their transmissions overlap for 25 minutes. Barlow refuses to see it as any kind of singing show shoot-out. He said: ""I've got to be honest with you. It's the same with music - I don't look right or left - I just concentrate on what we are doing and try and make it the best quality it can be."" 'A winter treat' Fellow judge Dannii Minogue, whose sister Kylie was a coach on The Voice UK, believes there is enough appetite from viewers for both shows to do well. ""I think they are really different shows,"" she said. ""The Voice has really settled into what it's doing. I think it has such a fan base. ""This one is different. We are giving them the skills which you can take on to use forever. But then also it's a 12-month gig. That's a really big job for someone. You come out of that and you can do anything you want to do."" Let It Shine editor Guy Freeman, who is also in charge of the BBC's Eurovision Song Contest coverage, insists that there are good reasons for the BBC to have replaced The Voice UK with another singing show. ""A: there's gut instinct. B: there's an awful lot of research which says that people at the beginning of a dark winter want a real treat on TV, because Christmas has finished. Everything is finished and you don't want TV to suddenly kind of desert you."" Let It Shine is on BBC One on Saturday from 19:00-20:25 GMT. The Voice UK is on ITV on the same night from 20:00 GMT.

"By Matt EverittBBC 6 Music News In his first interview in five years, the Guns N' Roses star told BBC 6 Music he was huge fan of Johnson's singing and ""wants to do it justice"". Rose was drafted in after Johnson was advised to stop playing live or ""risk total hearing loss"". He makes his debut with the band in Lisbon, Portugal, on Saturday 7 May. ""I'm happy and excited in one sense, but I think it would be inappropriate to be celebrating, in a certain way, at someone else's expense,"" he said. ""That's not what I'm here to do. It's an unfortunate situation."" 'Crushed' Some fans have been unhappy with Rose's hiring, with several thousand requesting ticket refunds for some of the European shows - although these have now all been re-sold. Johnson, 68, from Gateshead, has been lead singer with AC/DC since 1980. In a statement last month, he said he was ""crushed"" by his inability to fulfil the remaining tour dates. There have been rumours the split was acrimonious, but guitarist Angus Young explained he had spoken to Johnson extensively before he decided to leave the group. ""In his heart he wanted to finish [the tour] but because of that hearing factor he had to make the decision,"" he told the BBC. ""It's a hard thing to do, and he'd had the problem since we kicked off touring. It was his call. It was a shock to us too."" ""The last thing you want to do is walk away from something, but you don't want someone in a tragic situation; being deaf, or any other affliction."" Young said the band had ""seen our fair share of tragedies"", including the departure of his brother, guitarist Malcolm Young, after he developed dementia, and the death of original singer Bon Scott in 1980. ""After that you're doubly careful,"" he said. ""You want [band members] to be leaving in full body shape, not in a tragic way."" 'Really challenging' Rose also confirmed it was his idea to approach AC/DC about helping them complete the last 12 dates of their world tour. ""I called the day I read about it in the news, that there was a situation going on with Brian's hearing,"" he said. ""I called a guy who's their production manager right now... because I knew there was going to be a problem with having dates on sale and dates sold and stuff like that. So if I could help, and if I was able to do it, and they were interested, I'd love to help. And that's how it started. ""I wasn't looking at it like, 'I'm singing for AC/DC.' I was looking at it like, 'y'know, if I can, and if they think I'm able to do it."" Rose also said he didn't know whether he would be able to sing some of the songs in the set. ""A lot of the Back In Black stuff is really challenging. I'm not here in any way out of any disrespect to Brian. I can't take anything away from his singing at all,"" he said. ""He's a great singer and it's really challenging to sing it. I'm just trying to do it justice for the fans."" AC/DC are due to play London's Olympic Stadium on 4 June and Manchester's Etihad Stadium five days later. Rose will be alternating between shows with the Australian band and Guns N' Roses, who are on tour with original guitarist Slash for the first time since the 1990s.

"By Mark SavageBBC music reporter No song captured the heartbreak and optimism of Britain at war better than We'll Meet Again. Recorded in 1939 by Vera Lynn, who has died at the age of 103, its lyrics provided comfort to all those who were apart from their loved ones. ""We'll met again, don't know where, don't know when / But I know we'll meet again, some sunny day."" The song has since been quoted by the Queen and covered by Johnny Cash. It even entered the UK chart earlier this year, offering a message of hope during the coronavirus lockdown. ""Its lyric seemed to me to be a perfect example of what you might call the 'greetings card song,'"" Dame Vera wrote in her 1975 autobiography Vocal Refrain. ""A very basic human message of the sort that people want to say to each other but find embarrassing actually to put into words."" The singer was only 22 when she first recorded the song. It was in the first year of the conflict - during the so-called ""phoney war"", when troops were conscripted but very little fighting took place - that Lynn found the song while shopping around music publishing companies in London's Denmark Street for new material. One of the leading lights at the time was Hughie Charles, who had turned down the opportunity to open the batting for Lancashire County Cricket Club to seek his fortune as a composer. Having appraised Lynn as ""a very nice kid"", he encouraged her to record two patriotic songs he'd written with Ross Parker in anticipation of the coming hostilities - the strident, optimistic There'll Always Be An England and the more wistful We'll Meet Again. She first performed We'll Meet Again in the summer with Bert Ambrose and his orchestra. ""Looking back on the reviews, I notice the newspapers picked up on it right away,"" she told The Guardian in 1995. ""It was the perfect song to sign off with, and I started to use it more and more."" Synth-pop pioneer With a melody loosely based on Anton Rubinstein's Melody in F, it was the singer's performance that touched people's hearts - her characteristically low tone and emotional delivery chiming with the prevailing mood of the times. Her first recording of the song took place later that year, accompanied by Arthur Young on a new instrument called the Hammond Novachord, the world's first commercially-available polyphonic synthesizer. The ""instrument that reproduces the tone of a dozen instruments"" had only made its debut at the New York World Fair that April, making Lynn's single one of the first pop records (perhaps the very first) to feature a synth. However it was a later recording, backed by a full orchestra, that became more famous. By that time, she had become a fixture on forces' radio with her programme Sincerely Yours. More than 20% of the British public tuned in to the show every Sunday night, as Lynn performed songs of hope amid hardship and read out letters from people separated by the war. ""Although we did the programme from a studio, I always tried to imagine myself singing and talking from my own home,"" said the singer. ""Addressing myself not to an audience in the conventional sense, but to scattered individuals - an intimate conversation, but to a couple of million people."" Each episode closed with a rendition of We'll Meet Again. ""Keep smiling through / Just like you always do,"" she urged listeners. But not everyone was happy. Following a series of British military defeats in northern Africa, a small but vocal campaign argued that ""radio crooners"" and ""sloppy sentimental rubbish"" were affecting the forces' morale. ""If our Armed Forces really like this sort of thing, it should be the duty of the BBC to hide the fact from the world,"" wrote a typical correspondent to the Daily Telegraph in 1942. Instead, he argued, the troops should be listening to ""something more virile"". 'Anti-slush' campaign In response, the BBC formed a Dance Music Policy Committee, known colloquially as the ""anti-slush"" committee, to review the music it was broadcasting. ""We have recently adopted a policy of excluding sickly sentimentality which, particularly when sung by certain vocalists, can become nauseating and not at all in keeping with what we feel to be the need of the public in this country,"" said one ruling from 1942. Among the victims were Bing Crosby's standard I'll Be Home For Christmas, which the committee felt would make troops homesick and despondent. Similarly, The Mills Brothers' Paper Doll was banned as ""we did not think it desirable to broadcast the song's theme of feminine faithlessness"". The star was not swayed by the arguments, writing a column in the Sunday Dispatch saying the forces personnel and their ""wives and sweethearts"" valued the sentiment of her weekly radio show. ""During my two series of Sincerely Yours, I received letters from the boys in the forces at the rate of 1,000 a week. By the end, I received 18,000 and they have been coming ever since,"" she wrote. ""As I saw it,"" she later reflected, a song like We'll Meet Again ""was reminding the boys of what they were really fighting for, the precious, personal things rather than the ideologies and theories."" 'Peculiar delights' As the ""anti-slush"" debate raged, one of the star's ""middle-aged listeners"" wrote to the Radio Times, voicing his support for Lynn in particular. ""The words of her songs may have been so much sentimental twaddle. But she treated them with as much tenderness as though they were precious old folk, as though they meant something, something that she believed in and assumed that her audience believed in too,"" he wrote. ""By some magic she contrived to persuade you that neither she nor anybody else had ever sung or heard the songs before, that she had only just discovered their peculiar delights… and was generously passing them on."" Sadly, the BBC bowed to pressure and cancelled Lynn's show, but her popularity persisted. In 1943, she starred in a film loosely based on her own life, in which a beautiful young dancer discovers a gift for singing, and turns her talents to entertaining the British Army in Europe. Titled We'll Meet Again, the finale featured a re-recording of the title track, which became the best-known version of the song. Soon afterwards, Sincerely Yours was reinstated by the BBC, and Lynn continued to travel the world, performing to ""the boys"" in uniform. But while the bittersweet lyrics of We'll Meet Again were perfectly suited to the uncertainty of war, the song endured and adapted after 1945. It has been covered by Frank Sinatra, Peggy Lee, Rod Stewart and Sammy Davis Jr. It was referenced by Pink Floyd in their song Vera, and used to haunting effect in the closing scenes of Stanley Kubrick's apocalyptic satire Dr Strangelove. During the Cold War, it was chosen by the BBC's Wartime Broadcasting Service as one of the tracks that would be played to comfort and reassure survivors of a nuclear Armageddon. More recently, it has featured in TV shows like Stranger Things and The Simpsons, and films including Hellboy and Trainspotting 2; while it also provides an eerie backdrop to the Tower of Terror ride at Walt Disney World in Florida and Disneyland Paris. As the coronavirus hit the UK earlier this year, the song's message of cheerful resilience was invoked by the Queen who, in a rare televised address, told the nation: ""We will be with our friends again. We will be with our families again. We will meet again."" Her message helped the song enter the singles chart for the first time in its 81-year history (the original recording pre-dated the charts, although Charles and Parker's sheet music was a best-seller in the 1940s). In all that time, Dame Vera said she ""never tired of singing"" it. ""I had no idea that that particular song would become the tune people most associated with the war era,"" she wrote in her autobiography. ""Or that my voice would become the one that most reminded people of the hope for the future that we needed to have at that time. ""I'm told that schoolchildren today still learn the words to We'll Meet Again. That thrills me."" Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

"They have now both been billed as two of the best films of the year. Reviews for 1917 and Little Women have just come out, and critics are raving about both. Empire magazine said Little Women confirmed director Greta Gerwig as ""a major talent in American cinema"". And The Times declared Sam Mendes' 1917 ""an Oscar-night frontrunner"". 'The definitive adaptation of Little Women' ""If there were any remaining doubts that Greta Gerwig is a major talent in American cinema, put them to rest now,"" wrote Empire critic Helen O'Hara. Gerwig received an Oscar nomination for best director for Ladybird in 2017 - the only woman to have been up for that award since 2010. Now, she might repeat that feat for adapting Louisa May Alcott's classic autobiographical novel of sisterhood. The star-studded cast includes Saoirse Ronan, Emma Watson, Florence Pugh, Laura Dern and Meryl Streep. Little Women has been on the big screen several times before, but O'Hara said this is now the ""definitive"" version. ""Gerwig takes several bold storytelling choices that make this adaptation quite unlike any of its predecessors,"" her five-star review said. Vulture's Alison Willmore said the film ""feels, exhilaratingly, like the throwing down of a gauntlet"". She added: ""It doesn't just brim with life, it brims with ideas about happiness, economic realities, and what it means to push against or to hew to the expectations laid out for one's gender."" Writing in The Daily Mail, Brian Viner also gave the movie a glowing five stars, saying Little Women was ""a proper family treat for Christmas"", adding that Gerwig's vision had produced an ""enormously engaging adaptation"". Viner praised Gerwig's handling of the story, saying: ""She has ingeniously tinkered with the book's simple chronology, daring to move its cherished Christmas Day opening and constantly whisking us forward and backward in time."" However, Richard Lawson of Variety had reservations. Overall, he conceded ""it's often a lovely experience"" and admitted to leaving the cinema ""with eyes brimming"". But when it came to Gerwig's handling of the timeline, Lawson was not so readily swayed. He felt the director was ""too concerned with cramming in every plot beat from her source material"". 1917 is a 'single-shot masterpiece' In 1917, Mendes, who directed 007's Spectre and Skyfall, follows a mission by two messengers in World War One - supposedly inspired by a story the director's grandfather told him as a child. The Times' Kevin Maher gave it five stars and wrote: ""The resulting two hours of amphetamine-rush cinema is both a monumental technical achievement and, instantly, an Oscar-night frontrunner."" Peter Bradshaw, writing in The Guardian, also gave the film five stars, describing it as a ""single-shot masterpiece"", adding: ""Sam Mendes's 1917 is an amazingly audacious film; as exciting as a heist movie, disturbing as a sci-fi nightmare."" The movie appears to have been shot in one take. Cinematographer Roger Deakins ""pushes the single-take concept into new territory"", according to IndieWire's Kate Erbland. ""The idea is wild enough, but to make it look this dazzling from moment to moment is something else entirely,"" she wrote. Forbes critic Scott Mendelson declared that 1917 ""might be the best movie of 2019"". He wrote: ""Universal just dropped a bomb on the ongoing Oscar season, because Sam Mendes' 1917 is indeed one of the best movies of the year, if not THE best. ""It works as a visual miracle, a violent action picture, a grim anti-war fable, a character play and an emotional rollercoaster. It's everything it promises to be, visually, narratively and emotionally, operating both as a technical blow-out and just a damn great movie."" But Robbie Collin, writing in The Telegraph, gave it a more lukewarm three stars, making a comparison with Saving Private Ryan in his review. ""One of the most devastating manoeuvres in the history of negative Oscar campaigning was carried out in the 1999 season, when word was successfully put about - by the office of Harvey Weinstein, no less - that Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan didn't amount to much more than its undeniably impressive opening 27 minutes. ""You sense that slur would be received as rapturous praise by Sam Mendes's 1917, which in spirit is those 27 minutes and nothing but, showily stretched out to feature length.""

"By Justin ParkinsonBBC News Lisa Holdsworth, of the Writers' Guild of Great Britain (WGGB), said studios would want ""more scripts than ever"". But there would be a ""bottleneck"" in production, meaning less established writers having to wait longer to get projects started and receive payment. The government praised the ""fantastic"" work of UK writers. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab - standing in for Prime Minister Boris Johnson - said on Sunday that no changes to coronavirus lockdown measures were expected this week. He added that the UK was ""still not past the peak of this virus"". 'Lack of focus' Ms Holdsworth, who has written for TV shows including Midsomer Murders, Call the Midwife and New Tricks, said: ""There was a running joke on social media among writers for the first week of this that we've been doing this for years, we regularly take meetings in our pyjamas and all that kind of thing. ""But as the weeks have gone on, it's begun to bite a little and the reports that we're getting through are of a rise in anxiety across the board."" The government estimates the value of the creative industries to the UK economy is more than £100bn a year. and there are thought to be 85,000 self-employed authors, writers and translators in the country. Glasgow University's UK Copyright and Creative Economy Centre describes a ""winner-takes-all"" market for writers, showing a large disparity between star names and others. With film and TV studios and theatres closed, Ms Holdsworth said coronavirus had created an ""extremely worrying time"" for a significant proportion of the WGGB's members. ""Most freelancers prepare for a certain amount of uncertainty in their profession, certainly in the creative industries,"" she added. ""But it was awful, the week that we went into lockdown, to see actors, writers, musicians, their diaries emptied in the blink of an eye. ""Not only were they waiting for money to come in - because it takes ages for venues to pay people and money to come through - but all their future earnings disappeared with no sign of when they're going to start again."" The government announced last month that self-employed workers could apply for a monthly grant of up to £2,500 to help them cope with loss of earnings caused by coronavirus. But this money will not begin to arrive until at least early June. Ms Holdsworth instead recommended ""some kind of universal income, that then could have been claimed back via tax if needs be"", adding: ""But if this [the grant] is where it's got to go, then it must be expedited because people are in real hardship."" The BBC is repeating comedy shows including Gavin and Stacey and Outnumbered at peak-time during the coronavirus crisis, in the absence of new productions. Fewer episodes of EastEnders, Coronation Street and Emmerdale are being shown, as filming is disrupted or halted. But Ms Holdsworth said: ""Once TV and film production gets going again, people are going to want scripts more than ever. There's going to be a bottleneck. ""The problem we will have is the number of facilities and studios available to us. People are going to have to get really creative about how they film stuff. ""And so there will be a weird boom time once once restrictions are lifted. If you're a new, unestablished writer, it's going to be enormously difficult, more so than it usually is, because that bottleneck will mean companies won't be looking at new development for a while."" 'Slightly cheerier' However, one group which could do well more immediately out of the crisis is authors, according to Ms Holdsworth. ""It's going too be interesting, in terms of people wanting to download books and having a bit more time on the hands to read,"" she said. ""There may be a positive outcome."" And what advice is there for scriptwriters, playwrights, poets and authors, looking ahead? ""Don't write about Covid-19,"" said Ms Holdsworth. ""No one's going to want to read, listen to or watch anything about that. There's a definite pivot towards things with a slightly cheerier outlook. People are going to need that."" Creative industries minister Caroline Dinenage said: ""The UK is home to a huge number of incredibly talented writers, from screenwriters to novelists and playwrights to poets. ""They make up part of the UK's fantastic creative industries and have a huge role in keeping us entertained while we are all staying at home to protect the NHS and save lives.""","Screenwriters will face a ""weird boom time"" when the coronavirus crisis ends, the chair of the union representing the profession has predicted."
"By Tim MastersArts and entertainment correspondent The win comes just days after it was announced the show would be closing in the West End. ""Making an original British musical is tough,"" said the show's creator Gurinder Chadha at Tuesday's awards. ""We set out to create something completely original and bring in people who don't normally go to the West End. We achieved that."" Other winners at the awards included Kenneth Cranham, named best actor for his role as a man with dementia in The Father, while the best actress prize went to Denise Gough, who played a recovering addict in the National Theatre's People, Places and Things. Both actors will be soon be reprising their roles in London's West End. Cranham said: ""I've played it 171 times and I'm coming up for another 100."" Gough told the BBC: ""This character is indicative of the kind of parts that we need on stage - and on film and TV. A woman that is not an appendage to a man. This part for me is a fantastic addition to the canon of parts that will now be available for young women to play."" Dame Judi Dench won the prize for best Shakespearean performance for her role in The Winter's Tale, part of a season at the Garrick Theatre by the Kenneth Branagh Company. Martin McDonagh's Hangmen was named best new play. McDonagh's first play in the UK for more than 10 years, it is set in a pub on the day in 1965 when hanging was abolished. 'More English' Bend It Like Beckham, which has songs by Howard Goodall with lyrics by Charles Hart, is due to close on 5 March, less than a year after it opened. Speaking to the BBC ahead of the awards ceremony at London's Prince of Wales Theatre, Chadha said she was now preparing the show for a stadium tour of India. A team of producers are flying over from Mumbai for talks on the tour and Chadha is finding ways ""to make it more English"" for an Indian audience. Goodall hoped that Bend It Like Beckham would have a similar journey to musical Blood Brothers which became a long-running West End hit after touring the UK. ""We feel very proud of it and hopefully it will have a longer life,"" he said. ""These things do take a while to seep into the consciousness."" The full list of winners is: Best New Play: Hangmen by Martin McDonagh (Royal Court, Wyndham's Theatre) Best Musical (new or revival): Bend It Like Beckham (Phoenix Theatre) Best Actor: Kenneth Cranham in The Father (Bath Theatre Royal Ustinov Studio, Tricycle Theatre, Wyndham's Theatre and Duke of York's Theatre and UK tour) Best Actress: Denise Gough in People, Places and Things (National, London, Wyndham's Theatre) Best Shakespearean Performance: Judi Dench in The Winter's Tale (Garrick Theatre) Best Director: Robert Icke for Oresteia (Almeida Theatre, Trafalgar Studios) Best Designer: Anna Fleischle for Hangmen (Royal Court, Wyndham's Theatre) Most Promising Playwright: James Fritz for Four minutes twelve seconds (Hampstead Theatre, Trafalgar Studios) Most Promising Newcomer (other than a playwright): David Moorst in Violence and Son (Royal Court) All theatres in London unless stated otherwise",Bend It Like Beckham has been named best musical at the Critics' Circle Theatre Awards.
"It is believed to be the first time the bell has rung outside its regular schedule since 15 February, 1952. On that occasion, it tolled every minute for 56 strokes for the funeral of King George VI. Friday's event will be part of an art project encouraging everyone across the UK to ring a bell at 08:12 on Friday. It was conceived by Turner Prize-winner Martin Creed, who has called the event Work No. 1197: All the bells in a country rung as quickly and as loudly as possible for three minutes. Organisers hope it will set a world record for the largest number of bells rung simultaneously. For its part, Big Ben will have to be rung by hand, unlike the hourly chimes, which are automated. All The Bells will involve church bells, doorbells, cowbells and more - with events planned around the country. In Coventry, cyclists will gather outside the Transport Museum to ring their bicycle bells Scientists from the Cambridge-based British Antarctic Survey will also be taking part - even though they have no bells in their research station. Instead, they will be ""ringing"" and banging whatever they can lay their hands on, from kitchen pots to bedpans. Other participants include the Royal Navy, HMS Belfast, British Embassies worldwide and the famous Whitechapel Bell Foundry. Bells will be sounded in Britain's northernmost inhabited house in Skaw, the Shetland Isles, and the UK's most westerly church in Tresco, The Scilly Isles. It has also been confirmed that the National Assembly for Wales will be ringing its bell along with Stormont and the Scottish Parliament - meaning all four Parliaments are taking part. The Speaker of the House Of Commons, John Bercow, will attend the London leg. He said: ""I am delighted we can play our part in this Martin Creed artwork. ""This is primarily a work for every community within the UK to embrace as their own but it is also important for our famous landmarks to be represented when the eyes of the world will be on us."" Creed told the BBC the instructions were simple: ""To ring all the bells in Britain as loudly and as quickly, as often as possible, for three minutes"". As campanologists and amateurs chime in unison on Friday morning, sounds from around the UK will be broadcast on BBC Breakfast, Radio 4, Radio 2 and 5 live, as well as the BBC's local radio stations. Participants are being encouraged to register their interest on www.allthebells.com . Big Ben Facts",Big Ben will chime 40 times in three minutes on Friday as part of a mass bell-ringing event marking the start of the Olympics.
"The new company will start in January and will stage a series of shows for six months each year. The theatre is famous for launching the careers of stars such as Bill Nighy, Julie Walters, Jonathan Pryce and Pete Postlethwaite, who were part of the celebrated 1974 Everyman company. The theatre reopened in 2014 after a three-year rebuild at a cost of £27m. Described as a ""pioneering"" new structure, the aim of the company will be to ""genuinely embrace its community"", welcoming people from all backgrounds and will work closely with the Young Everyman Playhouse. The gender balanced company will be made up of around 14 actors and will work with artistic director Gemma Bodinetz and associate director Nick Bagnall. The first line-up of plays will be announced later in the year and auditions will be held for the company in a few months time. Everyman said the productions ""will aim to speak to the city-region and create a powerful bond with audiences"". Bodinetz said the vision of the company was ""about creating relationships"" with the aim ""to surprise, dazzle and invigorate everyone that encounters us"". Bagnall added he saw the return of the company to the theatre as ""a fantastic opportunity... to tell great stories that matter to the people of this city"".",The Everyman Theatre in Liverpool is to get its own resident company of actors for the first time in 25 years.
"The show won five awards including best drama series, best actress for Elisabeth Moss and best supporting actress for Ann Dowd. Big Little Lies took five prizes in the limited series categories, including wins for Nicole Kidman and Laura Dern. The British winners included Riz Ahmed, who took best lead actor in a limited series or movie for The Night Of. Other British winners included Charlie Brooker, who won best writing for a limited series for his Netflix show Black Mirror. One of the episodes, San Junipero, also won the trophy for best TV movie. Brooker said it ""was a story about love, and love will defeat hate, it will win"". British comedian John Oliver and his writing team scooped two prizes for satirical show Last Week Tonight. The Handmaid's Tale's win for best drama series means Hulu has become the first streaming service to win that award, beating the likes of big hitters Netflix and Amazon. Bruce Miller - who won two trophies as the show's writer and executive producer - thanked author Margaret Atwood, ""who created this world for all of us"". The show is adapted from Atwood's 1985 novel. In the limited series categories, HBO's Big Little Lies won best lead actress, (Nicole Kidman), supporting actress (Laura Dern), supporting actor (Alexander Skarsgard), director (Jean-Marc Vallee) and best limited series. Accepting the award for best limited series, Kidman, who played an abused wife, said that ""as much as the show has the entertainment value, it's about the issues"". She told the Emmys audience: ""We've shone a light on domestic abuse. It's a complicated, insidious disease. It exists far more than we allow ourselves to know."" Julia Louis-Dreyfus won best actress in a comedy series for Veep for the sixth year in a row - breaking the record for the most Emmys won by a lead actor for the same role. Veep, which was created by Armando Iannucci, also won one the prize for best comedy series. Sterling K Brown's win for best lead actor in a drama series marked the first time an African-American actor had won in the category in almost 20 years. Atlanta star Donald Glover scored another historic first by becoming the first black person to win an Emmy for directing a comedy show, while Master of None's Lena Waithe became the first African-American woman to win for comedy writing. Political references became a running theme during the night - with host Stephen Colbert and several winners poking fun at US President Donald Trump. ""At long last, Mr President, here is your Emmy,"" said Alec Baldwin as he collected his prize for supporting actor in a comedy series, mocking the president's frustration at never having won for The Apprentice. Baldwin regularly portrays President Trump on comedy sketch show Saturday Night Live, which won four awards including best variety sketch series and best supporting actress in a comedy series for Kate McKinnon. And after he was named best lead actor in a comedy series, Glover said: ""I want to thank Trump for making black people number one on the most oppressed list."" Jaws also dropped when Mr Trump's former press secretary Sean Spicer came on stage to joke that the ceremony would attract ""the largest audience to witness an Emmys"" - a reference to disputed claims he made over numbers attending the president's inauguration in January. In the competition, several high-profile series failed to live up to expectations, including Westworld and Stranger Things, which both went home empty-handed. Game of Thrones, a big winner at previous Emmys, wasn't eligible this year because episodes from its last series didn't air during the Emmys eligibility window. Likewise, the new series of Twin Peaks will have to wait until next year to be considered. Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

"By Mark SavageBBC music reporter The star is also co-writing the movie with Diablo Cody, the Oscar-winning screenwriter of Juno and Young Adult. The script is expected to chart her rise from Michigan, to the slums of New York City, to global superstardom - via songs such as Like A Virgin and Vogue. The star said the film would focus on music, adding: ""Music has kept me going and art has kept me alive."" The as-yet-untitled project will be Madonna's third as director after 2008's Filth and Wisdom and 2011's WE, which was based around King Edward VIII's affair with Wallis Simpson. The latter film was panned by critics, and bombed at the box office, making just $2m (£1.5m) against a budget of $11m (£8.5m). However, rock and pop biopics are in the middle of a purple patch, with huge successes for Elton John's Rocketman and the Freddie Mercury film Bohemian Rhapsody, for which Rami Malek earned an Oscar. Madonna's entry to the genre will be made by Universal Pictures - which previously attracted the artist's anger by snapping up an unofficial script based on her life. No casting or production timeline for the film has been announced, but the pop star has charted the early stages of scripting on her Instagram account. In a Q&A with fans, she said the biopic would be about her ""struggle as an artist trying to survive in a man's world,"" adding that the journey covers a range of emotions: ""happy, sad, mad, crazy, good, bad and ugly"". She added that the plot would address her relationship with artist Jean-Michel Basquiat, the fallout from her controversial Like A Prayer video and her experience filming Evita. ""I want to convey the incredible journey that life has taken me on as an artist, a musician, a dancer - a human being, trying to make her way in this world,"" Madonna said in a statement, confirming her directorial role.

"By Rebecca Thomas Entertainment reporter These are minutes for finding composure, getting ""in the zone"" - and putting the finishing touches to make-up. The special quality of this period has long fascinated photographer Simon Annand. For more than 30 years, he's been immortalising it through his lens after being granted exclusive pre-show access into stars' dressing rooms. The result is a series of images called simply The Half. A forthcoming exhibition from the series will include 74 photographs that have never been seen before in public, with subjects including Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Dame Judi Dench, Helen Mirren, Gillian Anderson and Stephen Fry. Annand says that unlike working on a film set, where the actor can wait for ages to be called, ""the theatre demands that he or she be ready at a fixed time and this is repeated each day. There is no escape and the discipline required is intense"". In his sessions, he's tried to be as non-verbal as possible, so as not to disturb the rhythm of the actor, he tells BBC News, adding: ""Objective information can be more revealing, allowing the viewer to read the image as they wish. Rather than an attempt to influence their impression."" Annand has talked us through a selection of shots from the show. Gillian Anderson at the Young Vic in 2016 for A Streetcar Named Desire by Tennessee Williams She played the fragile southern belle Blanche Dubois. Annand: ""For this performance she won the Evening Standard award for best actress and made Blanche her own. This session lasted barely four minutes but that was enough. ""Gillian's presence is such that almost anything she does makes a photograph. In this case, turning around, at a moment when she is slipping into the fictional character, suggested to me why she was interested in playing this part. ""It has always been my intention to make images where the atmosphere is intense but remains open for the viewer to hang their own story on the picture."" Cate Blanchett at the Albery Theatre for Plenty by David Hare in 1999 Blanchett played the heroine Susan Traherne in a post-war drama spanning 20 years. Annand: ""The first photograph I ever took of Cate. She entered the dressing room, rolled a cigarette and was contemplating the performance ahead. Taken through the mirror. ""This is not a pose, as some have asked, but the coming together of her demands during the day, going on the stage in 30 minutes and the presence of a photographer in the dressing room. ""I have always chosen Cate as my favourite person to photograph, especially as she chose not to chuck me out at a time when privacy might have preferable. Her openness and willingness not to shut down is, in my view, one of her greatest strengths as an artist."" Jude Law for Hamlet at Wyndham's Theatre in 2009 Law played the tragic Danish prince in a modern-day staging of the Shakespeare classic. Annand: ""Jude was a very popular leader of the company. The image of Fred Astaire was an antidote to the difficulties of playing the troubled Dane. ""It is often remarked by actors that the more intense a story is, and Hamlet is one of the most complex, the more it is necessary to create a mood of light relief backstage. The atmosphere that evening was very playful and this photo shows the actor beginning to take on the demands of a role, minutes before leaving the room."" Phoebe Waller Bridge for Rope by Patrick Hamilton at the Almeida in 2010 Waller-Bridge played Leila Arden in a murder thriller set amidst the privilege and emptiness of the jazz age. Annand: ""The first time I had the good fortune to photograph Phoebe was two or three years before this at The Bush. ""The sense of her unabashed brightness was noticeable and very refreshing. It's no accident she is adored by the many who know her work."" Dame Judi Dench for Peter and Alice by John Logan at the Noel Coward Theatre in 2013 Dame Judi starred alongside Ben Whishaw in a story of loss and grief. Annand: ""This is an image of the great actress just after a conversation about her late and beloved husband Michael Williams. ""Judi has always been a supporter of The Half, for which I am forever grateful. It is a privilege to witness her in a moment of introspection and it seemed like her arm was extended to embrace a cherished absence."" Tom Hardy for Festen by David Eldridge at the Almeida in 2004 Hardy played Michael in the production based on the first of the Dogme films and which tackles the long-term consequences of child abuse. Annand: ""He is reading the script of a Mission Impossible film… People are sometimes surprised at how Tom looked then. ""He appeared supremely confident and in a way plotting the future which was to be so successful. The kind of presence you cannot miss in a room."" Sheila Atim for The Girl of the North Country by Conor McPherson at the Noel Coward theatre in 2018 Atim played Marianne Laine in the musical based on the work of Bob Dylan and set during the winter of the Great Depression in the US. Annand: ""Sheila is about to become world famous in the prequel to Game of Thrones. ""Everyone in the business has followed her steady rise to stardom over the last four or five years. She has a voice like an angel, is a delight to work with and deserves every credit she will undoubtedly receive."" Stephen Fry for Twelfth Night at The Globe in 2012 Fry played the killjoy Malvolio in the Shakespeare comedy. Annand: ""Stephen's performance as Malvolio was his first in a theatre since prematurely leaving a West End production of Cellmates in 1995 after an attack of stage fright. ""It seemed charming and wonderfully brave to have chosen the unpopular malcontent for his comeback. Another triumph in a long line of English archetypes he has crafted for his fortunate audience."" Colin Firth for The Lonely Road by Christopher Fetts at the Old Vic in 1985 Firth played Felix in a story of family deception set in Vienna at the beginning of the 20th Century. Annand: ""Colin Firth playing in the theatre before his film/TV career took off. ""There are some performers who, when they first appear on the scene, it is self-evident very early on they are born to channel certain aspects of human nature. Colin Firth is one of them. It is the theatre's loss that this wonderful actor has not appeared more often on the stage."" Anthony Hopkins at the National Theatre in 1986 for Pravda by David Hare and Howard Brenton Hopkins played the Murdoch-like media tycoon Lambert Le Roux in the satirical comedy about Fleet Street. Annand: ""Just back from a long time away in America, preparing for his extraordinary performance in Pravda at the NT. Like many great film stars, to whom the camera is attracted, his head seems large in proportion to his shoulders. ""He initially reneged on an agreement to be seen. After reminding him of his senior position in the business, and my intention to promote theatre as live performance, he liked my determination not to give up and enthusiastically gave me two hours for the session. ""In those days the session was accompanied by an interview and a tiny recorder can be seen on the left [of the bottom right-hand photo]."" Meera Syal for Annie at the Piccadilly Theatre in 2017 Syal played the formidable children's home mistress Miss Hannigan in the classic musical. Annand: ""It has always fascinated me why an actor chooses a certain role, and then to see the manifestation he or she will give to the character, especially if a heightened style is used. ""The make-up for Meera as Miss Hannigan, the cruel alcoholic who hates children, is a perfect combination to convey the awfulness of the character but it also adds a certain vibrant attraction. Satan was after all an angel who was thrown out of heaven and then tried to take all the other angels with him, down to hell."" David Tennant for The Rivals by Richard Brinsley Sheridan at the RSC in 2001 Tennant played Jack Absolute in this classic comedy of errors from 1775 set in five acts and telling the story of the romantic difficulties of Lydia Languish. Annand: ""[Theatre director] Marianne Elliot's mother, Rosalind Knight [actress], said there is a wonderful new talent down at the RSC. Knowing Rosalind had the authority to make trustworthy recommendations, considerable effort was made to secure a session with him. The camera loves a quick and quirky intelligence.""

"By Lu-Hai LiangBBC News This ""virtual idol variety show"", from Chinese streaming platform iQIYI, features three celebrity judges hoping to find the next big star. Yet while the concept is familiar, the execution is like nothing we've seen before. Contestants walk out into a capacious hall, complete with a looming T-Rex skeleton hanging from the high ceiling, and perform to the judging panel in real-time. But these hopefuls are not your familiar pub-gigging wannabes, instead they are digital creations, drawn and styled like Japanese anime figures. iQIYI, best known for popular talent shows such as The Rap of China, are exploring futuristic territory with their latest TV foray. Among the 31 virtual contenders, there's an anthropomorphic five-tailed fox dressed in a suit and a cutesy monosyllabic seal, both auditioning for a spot on the judges' teams. ""It seems like I stepped into a video game,"" says Angelababy, one of the show's judges, in the first episode. The model-turned-actress is ubiquitous in China, her image dominating screens and billboards. Virtual celebrities, however, are not entirely new. In Japan, Hatsune Miku has won a large fanbase since her 2007 debut, despite being virtual. First appearing as a voice-synthesising program, she has featured on TV, in concert and even appeared on the Late Show With David Letterman. On Instagram, the virtual influencer and music artist Lil Miquela has some 2.8m followers; closer to home, UK indie band Gorillaz consists solely of cartoon members. Talent shows have become big business in China, with Western-influenced singing competitions such as The Voice of China a huge hit with homegrown audiences. In 2018, Britain's Jessie J enrolled as a contestant - and won - the Chinese talent show Singer, significantly boosting her international fanbase. But in recent years, these talent shows have become increasingly like their Japanese and South Korean counterparts and, arguably, formulaic. Shows like Produce 101 and Youth With You, which are popular among China's youth demographic, ""follow the trainee system used for Korean idols"" explains Ina Yang, a Chinese pop-culture podcast host, and have adopted the glamorous - and gruelling - group idol culture popularised by K-pop. But this latest talent show is breaking new ground. Technical challenges ""We started from zero with Dimension Nova, as variety shows featuring virtual idols had never been done before,"" executive producer Liu Jiachao told the BBC. He says the virtual reality (VR) technology involved has proved very demanding, adding, ""that's why we only chose 31 contestants out of the 150 or more candidates that we screened"". The makers of Dimension Nova are keen to show viewers the technology behind the scenes and frequently intercut the virtual performances with shots of a dark studio humming with computers. In fact, it was a computer game spin-off that sparked the idea that would evolve into Dimension Nova. ""The original idea came to us in September 2019, when we saw League of Legend's game character Akali perform 'offline' as a virtual idol,"" says Liu. Watching Akali on screen convinced Liu that technology had progressed to a level where it could produce sophisticated VR performances. What followed was about a year's research and development to get the show off the ground. And there were many challenges along the way. ""The production procedure of traditional reality shows does not apply in the case of Dimension Nova - so there was no standard practice to refer to,"" says Liu. The show auditioned more than 150 virtual idols from studios who produce such creations and chose candidates that met the technological requirements of their production. ""We then worked together with the companies that designed these idols to create the performances that ended up on the show."" Subsequently, the producers worked with Norwegian visual production company Vizrt, and videogame software Unreal Engine 4, as well as nine augmented reality cameras to bring the virtual characters 'to life'. ""The cameras and monitors on set had to be re-positioned and re-adjusted repeatedly to capture the natural interaction between the show's judges and virtual idol contestants,"" says Liu. The creation of virtual idols and influencers is a burgeoning market. Tanya Van Gastel, a Chinese technology analyst who follows the industry, believes virtual influencers (VI) are the ultimate marketing tool. Unlike their flesh-and-bone counterparts, VIs can work all hours and can be created with different niches in mind. Moreover, they appeal to the younger, online-savvy generation, Gastel explains. Virtual influencers offer tantalising commercial opportunities too, and brands such as KFC, Prada, Calvin Klein, and Vogue China are among those using them in their marketing. China's Gen Z - often defined as those born after 1995 - are a lucrative demographic and more open to these non-physical influencers. They number almost 170 million and are even more lavish spenders than their predecessors, Chinese millennials. Many among China's Gen Z are fans of ACG (anime, comics, games), observes Ina Yang, and there is considerable overlap between these three genres. Dimension Nova, which combines anime-styled contestants with the narrative elements inherent to all talent shows, has targeted this audience. ""Virtual idol is not a foreign concept to Gen-Zers,"" says executive producer Liu. ""In China and overseas, there are successful cases of virtual idols building and maintaining large fanbases, such as Hatsune Miku and Luo Tianyi, for example."" Establishing a virtual idol is a committed process, notes Van Gastel, but can be very creative. Storylines are written and social media accounts created for each idol. Talent shows in China have high levels of audience participation, with social media leveraged to a greater degree than their Western counterparts. On Weibo, China's Twitter-like social media platform, Dimension Nova has already generated 690 million reads and 6.9 million comments and posts. The show is at once a talent contest, a technological showcase, and a commercial vehicle - with the stated aim of introducing the concept and culture of virtual idols to a wider audience. ""So far, the Chinese market of virtual idol remains untapped,"" says Liu. ""The goal of Dimension Nova is to expand the market influence of this industry and drive the growth of companies from all parts of the industrial chain. ""This growth will eventually unleash the potential of the whole industry and allow the market to thrive.""","At first glance, there's nothing very remarkable about yet another singing competition in talent show-obsessed China, but Dimension Nova is different - this time, all the contestants are virtual."
"The outer space drama starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney took $44.3m (£27.7m) according to early estimates. It easily beat Tom Hanks' latest film, Captain Phillips, which took $26m (£16.3m). The movie tells the true story of the cargo ship captain who was taken hostage by Somali pirates after his ship was hijacked in 2009. Both films have earned critical acclaim with both Bullock and Hanks tipped as likely Oscar contenders. Gravity's successful second week haul brings its total US domestic takings to $123.4m (£77.2m). ""They say what goes up must come down, but that's not really true with Gravity,"" box office analyst Paul Dergarabedian said. ""To have opened as big as it did last week and only drop 21% [in revenue], that's really an amazing hold. It's a direct testament to the word of mouth on the movie."" Animated sequel Cloudy With A Chance of Meatballs 2 was at three in its third week of release with $14.2m (£8.9m). The weekend's only other new release, Machete Kills, opened in fourth place with $3.8m (£2.4m). The gun-toting sequel from director Robert Rodriguez and starring Danny Trejo and Michelle Rodriguez is the follow-up to Machete, which earned $11.4m (£7.1m) when it opened in 2010.

"The inquiry was announced in the wake of the death of a guest who appeared on Kyle's ITV show after taking a lie detector test. The broadcaster axed the long-running show soon after Steve Dymond died. The committee said senior ITV executives would be the first to give evidence to the inquiry. Chairman Damian Collins MP said: ""We're hoping that Jeremy Kyle will take this opportunity to come and answer questions about measures taken to prepare and support contestants"". MPs will also question ITV's chief executive Dame Carolyn McCall; Sir Peter Bazalgette, the chairman of ITV plc, and Chris Wissun, the director of Content Compliance at ITV plc on 25 June. The inquiry will invite a range of former participants and programme-makers to give evidence over the coming months. An inquest is currently going on into the death of Mike Thalassitis, a star of ITV show Love Island, who was found dead in a park in north London in March. His death sparked calls for improved aftercare for people who take part in reality TV shows. Broadcasting watchdog Ofcom said it was ""vital"" that people taking part in such shows were properly looked after, adding its broadcasting code of conduct could include new protections for them.

"But on 5 July 1954 the BBC was preparing for its first TV news bulletin to go live. The first broadcasts were sober affairs: there were no personality newsreaders and the format resembled a radio bulletin over still pictures. Richard Baker was the first to read the news, but it would be another three years before he would actually be seen on screen as there were concerns a human face would detract from the serious business of the news. September 1960 saw the first 10 O'Clock News and in the following years there was a growth in news programmes - World at One, News Review, Newsreel. Facilities for broadcasting the news were dotted around London, with Lime Grove Studios and Alexandra Palace serving as television studios in the early days. Lime Grove Studios near Hammersmith, a film studio built in 1915 and where The Wicked Lady was shot, was bought by the BBC as a temporary measure while the White City studios were being built. The ""temporary arrangement"" was to last more than 40 years - although not for News - until the BBC sold it in 1991. The whole TV news operation moved to Television Centre in White City in 1969, which was to become a landmark building and ""the face"" of the BBC for many years. The 1970s saw the launch of the Nine O'Clock News, with a roster of presenters including Robert Dougall, Kenneth Kendall and Richard Baker - who had already been mainstays of BBC News for more than 15 years. TV news was very much bound together with the more established radio news at the beginning. Nan Winton was to be the first female BBC newsreader back in 1960, although ITN had blazed the trail for women in TV news with Barbara Mandell a regular from 1955. Winton's role was shortlived as BBC research at the time revealed a dislike for a woman reading the news. There would not be a regular female newsreader until Angela Rippon joined the team on the flagship Nine O'Clock News in 1975. Rippon was arguably one of the first newsreaders to cross over into a ""TV personality"" role, branching out into light entertainment on Come Dancing and Top Gear, when it was a very different show to how it is now. Speaking about her memorable moments reading the news, Rippon said: ""I covered the death of Airey Neave when he was blown up by a bomb outside Parliament, the Jonestown massacre was one of mine. ""And I announced when Pope John Paul became pope. We were live on air and I was able to say there for the very first time we have a sighting of the man who will become Pope John Paul."" She added: ""It was also me who announced to the world who shot JR, so there was light and shade in television news!"" The only news produced for younger consumers was a weekly Children's Newsreel, a strand of the Newsreel programme which covered current affairs as well as lighter stories. But in 1972 John Craven's Newsround was launched to give a daily news round-up for children aged between six and 12. As the first regular bulletin of the day for a while, it was able to break stories such as the loss of the space shuttle Challenger in 1986. Newsround is still broadcast every weekday, although it has shifted to dedicated children's channel CBBC. Another big change - one that has come and gone - was the advent of Ceefax, effectively the first rolling news. With its distinctive four-paragraph multi-coloured pages, it launched 40 years ago and was a platform for fast, concise news. Ceefax was put out to pasture in 2012 as the analogue television signal was switched off. A text-based news service is still available on digital TVs. As technology developed, cameras and sound equipment became smaller and lighter, which allowed reporters and crew to be sent anywhere, anytime, including to war zones. The likes of Kate Adie and Brian Hanrahan became the faces of war reporting. In June 1989, Adie reported live from Tiananmen Square in China, giving a first-hand account of the government's deadly crackdown on protesters. Hanrahan, who died in 2010, was best known for his reporting of the Falklands War, although he covered world stories across the globe. But reporting from such dangerous regions comes with great risks, and a number of journalists and film crew have been killed or seriously injured while on reporting duties. One of the biggest changes in the news schedule was the introduction of Breakfast Time in 1983, the first of its kind for British TV. Mixing hard news with lighter features, including an exercise segment with the Green Goddess Diana Moran. Soon after, ITV launched its morning offering TV-am, sparking a decades-long ratings rivalry. Breakfast Time morphed into Breakfast News, dropping the lighter features to make way for a more authoritative tone. The morning show is now called BBC Breakfast, broadcasting from its new home in Salford, where it moved as part of the BBC's drive to spread its teams around the country. The Six O'Clock News launched in 1984. It was the most watched news programme until 2006, when the 10 O'Clock News took over. The bulletin has since returned to the number one slot in the audience ratings league. Following in the footsteps of its US counterparts, the BBC launched its 24-hour rolling news channel BBC News 24 in 1997. However, the BBC's channel along with those from other broadcasters, have not been without their critics, whose main objection is to so much airtime being dedicated to nothing happening. This was playfully highlighted recently during the run-up period to the birth of Prince George, when newsreader Simon McCoy, reporting from outside the hospital, said: ""Until then we are going to be speculating about this royal birth with no facts at hand."" Ratings wars became part of the news agenda again when the BBC decided in 2000 to move its night-time bulletin from nine to 10, setting up a clash with ITV. Television Centre was vacated and sold off in 2013 as BBC News was on the move again, this time to Broadcasting House in the centre of London. While the BBC has its own extensive news website - which grew up from humble beginnings into one of the world's most popular news sites - it is perhaps the internet that poses the biggest threat to television news. A report by the BBC Trust, the BBC's governing body, recently reported there had been a 14% drop in the number of young viewers watching BBC news over the past decade. And in the under-45 category, online is now the first port of call for the headlines. BBC TV has now set itself the tricky task of wooing back young viewers in an age when they have so many other ways to access news. But the BBC also has its very vocal detractors, pushing for the whole corporation to be broken up and commercialised. These critics argue there is no place in the 21st Century for a publicly funded TV network. So even while it marks its anniversary, BBC News is also trying to figure out how to hang on to its esteemed place in the broadcasting landscape.",There is no shortage of television news to be found on UK screens. Switch on the TV and there is any number of 24-hour rolling news channels or bulletins at all times of the day.
"For the seventh year in a row, box office revenues grew - up 1.5% to £512.3m, according to the Society of London Theatre (Solt). However, attendances were down 106,000, with 14.2 million tickets sold for plays, musicals, dance and opera in the West End. Solt blamed the poor weather for the dip in attendance. It said the strong results reflected ""the vibrancy of London's unique mix of commercial and subsidised theatre"" as well as ongoing industry investment in new people and writing. ""A huge range of superb productions ensured that a visit to the theatre was a must-do for large numbers of the public,"" said Nica Burns, president of Solt. ""These results were completely unexpected given the global economic crisis and the disaster of the lack of transport in and around London over the Christmas snow,"" she told The Stage. ""It wasn't snow that stopped people coming - it was the fact they couldn't rely on transport."" The year saw a record number of performances - 18,615 - with attendances for plays up 2%. However, audiences for musicals were down 3% The figures relate to London's 52 major commercial and grant-aided London theatres.","London's theatreland remained buoyant in 2010 despite the economic downturn, figures show."
"Mean Girls, based on the 2004 film, has 12 nominations - including one for Tina Fey, who wrote both versions. SpongeBob has taken Broadway by storm and is also up for 12 trophies. They are ahead of Angels In America, which has 11 nominations, and Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, with 10. Both productions opened in London before transferring to New York. Mean Girls - 12 nominations The hit film about the perils of high school cliques starred Lindsay Lohan, and the stage version opened to warm - if not rave - reviews in April. Tina Fey is nominated for best book (IE script) of a musical, while cast members Taylor Louderman, Grey Henson and Ashley Park are up for acting prizes. Casey Nicholaw is nominated for two awards - best direction of a musical and best choreography. SpongeBob SquarePants: The Musical - 12 nominations Ethan Slater is up for best leading actor in a musical for playing the show's leading sponge (and doing so without any elaborate square costume or prosthetics or even yellow face paint). That's not because of a lack of money - the show has a reported budget of $20m (£15m). Its nominations also include one for the score, which features songs written especially by stars including John Legend, Lady Antebellum, Panic! At the Disco, Aerosmith's Steven Tyler and Joe Perry, Sara Bareilles, The Flaming Lips and Cyndi Lauper. Angels In America - 11 nominations Actors Andrew Garfield, Nathan Lane, Denise Gough and Susan Brown are all nominated for their roles in Tony Kushner's pioneering play, which is set amid the Aids crisis in 1980s America. It was revived by the National Theatre in London last May before moving to Broadway this March. The epic production is in two halves - when the play first opened, the first half won the Tony Award for best play in 1993, and the second half won the same prize the following year. Harry Potter and the Cursed Child - 10 nominations In its first week of previews on Broadway in April, the Harry Potter stage show smashed the box office record for a non-musical show. That follows huge success - including nine Olivier Awards - for its original run in London. Jamie Parker (Harry), Noma Dumezweni (Hermione) and Anthony Boyle (Scorpius) - who all won Oliviers - are in with a chance of adding Tony trophies to their collections. Writer Jack Thorne is nominated for best play, while John Tiffany is shortlisted for best director of a play.

"Earlier in the week, Mark Rothko's No 1 (Royal Red and Blue) soared beyond its pre-sale estimate of $35 million-$50 million (£22m-£31.4m) at a Sotheby's contemporary art sale - which also racked up the best results in the auction house's history. A brief but heated bidding war saw the abstract work fetch $75.1 million (£47.2m). Art investors, it appears, are still rich and plentiful - with clients in Asia and the Middle East bringing a healthy injection of new cash to the proceedings. Contemporary art is currently the darling of the art collectors' world. Many negotiate private sales behind closed doors - but the excitement of the auction room can prove an irresistible playground for millionaires, as some recent record-breaking sales attest. The Scream - Edvard Munch In May this year, Edvard Munch's The Scream - arguably one of the world's most famous images - became the most expensive artwork sold at auction. The privately-owned 1895 pastel fetched $119.9m (£74m) in a bidding war that lasted just 12 minutes. Seven bidders were competing for the work, which had a starting price of $40m (£25m). According to Forbes, The Scream is the eighth most expensive painting sold at a private or public auction after prices have been adjusted for inflation. Nude, Green Leaves and Bust - Pablo Picasso Picasso's 1932 painting based on his muse, Marie-Therese Walter, sold at auction in New York in 2010 for $106.5m (£65.5m). One of a sequence of paintings made by the Spanish artist while living in Normandy, it is considered ""amongst his greatest achievements of the inter-war period"". It rocketed over the pre-sale estimate of $70m-$90m, outstripping Picasso's Garcon a la Pipe, which sold at auction for $104.1m in 2004. Picasso first met Ms Walter in 1927 and began to paint her four years later. Walking Man 1 - Alberto Giacometti In London, in February 2010, a bronze sculpture by Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti fetched £65m (the equivalent of $104.3m at the time). Bidding opened at £12m. But within eight minutes a winning phone bid had secured L'homme qui marche I, eclipsing the pre-sale estimate of £18m by almost £40m. The statue, originally commissioned for a public space in downtown Manhattan, was part of the collection of the collapsed Dresdner Bank. Speculation that it was brought by Russian billionaire and Chelsea FC owner Roman Abramovich was later denied. Adele Bloch-Bauer II - Gustav Klimt A 1912 portrait, Adele Bloch-Bauer II, by the Austrian secessionist artist Gustav Klimt fetched $87.9m at an auction in New York in 2006. The painting was one of five Klimt works looted by the Nazis and returned to their owners earlier that year. Five works were returned to Maria Altmann, the niece of Adele and Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer, following a long-running legal dispute with the Austrian government. Four of the paintings were sold at the Sotheby's auction. New York's Neue Galerie is reported to have paid $135m in a private sale for the fifth looted Klimt portrait, Adele Bloch-Bauer I earlier the same year. That brought the total sale price for the five Klimts to approximately $330.7m. Triptych - Francis Bacon The auction record for Irish-born painter Francis Bacon was set at Sotheby's in New York in May 2008, when one of his Triptychs sold for $86.3m (£55m) - the most ever spent on a work by the British artist. The vast three-panelled allegorical painting easily topped its pre-sale estimate of $70m. It was reportedly brought by Roman Abramovich, just 24 hours after he had purchased Lucian Freud's Benefits Supervisor Sleeping for $33.6m. Portrait of Dr Gachet - Vincent Van Gogh One of two portraits of Van Gogh's doctor and friend reached a record price of $82.5m at a sale in New York in 1990, when it was acquired by a Japanese businessman. Given that the auction took place more than 20 years ago, it remains the highest price ever paid for art at a public auction once adjusted for inflation. Just days later, new owner Ryoei Saito went on buy Auguste Renoir's Bal du moulin de la Galette for $78.1m. Mr Saito died in 1996. The painting is believed to have been sold privately but its whereabouts are currently unknown.","Christie's is calling it the most successful sale of post-war and contemporary art ever, after an auction in New York raised $412m (£259m) with record prices set for 11 artists, including Franz Kline and Jeff Koons."
"An Evening with Sylvester Stallone will see the 67-year-old discuss his life and career at Westminster's Central Hall on 11 January. ""I have a big mix of wonderful stories and colourful anecdotes,"" the star told the Evening Standard. Fans will also be able to put questions to the Rocky and Rambo star. Stallone said people he met usually expected him to be uncommunicative, like some of the characters he has played in the past. ""When people meet me they're often surprised - I talk a great deal,"" he said. ""I'm perceived to be this solitary character but nothing could be further from the truth. ""I consider myself something of a raconteur. I have a rather audacious sense of humour."" Stallone will be in the UK in January to promote his next film, Grudge Match, with Robert De Niro. He follows in the footsteps of Oscar-winner Al Pacino, who held a similar Night With... event at the London Palladium in June.",Hollywood action star Sylvester Stallone is offering fans the chance to get up close and personal with him at a one-off show in London next month.
"By Liam AllenEntertainment reporter, BBC News Fifteen years later, and with sales of 57 million solo records behind him, he's finally been given his chance on Progress. The Flood, the opening track from the man band's first album as a reunited five-piece, begins with lush strings as Williams belts out: ""Standing on the edge of forever, at the start of whatever."" It's a beginning that would sit well on any Williams solo album from 2000's Sing When You're Winning onwards. Not to be outdone, Gary Barlow stamps his mark with a trademark rising middle eight heralding a chorus that owes much to four-piece 2005-2009 Take That. It offers a tantalising glimpse of the best of both worlds. But Progress' first single is not typical of the album. While Robbie's input feels like an extension of his solo material, contributions from Gary, Mark and the other two are distinctly different from their last two releases, Beautiful World and the Circus. Don't expect a Patience, Rule The World or Greatest Day. Take That mark three - as the album title suggests - is all about reinvention. Thanks to the album's producer, Madonna collaborator Stuart Price, it's electro-tinged reinvention. On paper, an electrofied Take That shouldn't work. But Price's fusion of chugging synth lines, a mixture of synthesized and real drums, and subtle harmonies pushes things forward. Williams wordplay brings another dimension throughout - Barlow would never have written ""we'll be practising our politics, defending all our policies, preparing for apocalypse"", from possible single SOS. This is the album Rudebox - Williams' disappointing 2006 sonic experiment - could have been. Ballad-free zone But while Progress is likely to be lauded by critics, Take That are steering a brave, new course given Rudebox's alienation of the core Williams audience. Female pop fans in their late 30s/early 40s are not necessarily the biggest fans of electro-rock. Those same fans will be wondering why they can't find a Barlow ballad. Wait, with its opening piano and high, cinematic strings, threatens to be just that before an electronic breakbeat unexpectedly kicks in. The closest we get to a Barlow epic is Eight Letters - ""when I went away, what I forgot to say, was all I had to say, eight words, three words, one meaning"". But even here, the usual opening piano chords are replaced with a distorted solo synth. Kidz, featuring Owen in the verse and a heavily-processed Williams in the chorus, is a definite contender for second single, sounding as it does like a cross between Sam Sparro's Black and Gold, and Feel Good Inc by Damon Albarn's Gorillaz. It faces strong competition from Happy Now which, along with The Flood and delicate duet Pretty Things, features Barlow and Williams on lead vocals. The harmony-drenched chorus of ""I feel myself falling, I'm feeling happy now"" is the only moment reminiscent of five-piece 1990s Take That - think Everything Changes 2010. It's also the most uplifting moment. Williams' return to the fold has brought a moodier edge to Take That's usually breezy sound. Mark Owen, meanwhile - making a pitch to become Take That's George Harrison - performs admirably on his songs, SOS and What Do You Want From Me? Both sound like The Killers - whose last album Day & Age was produced by one Stuart Price - particularly Owen's Mr Brightside-alike What Do You Want From Me? Howard Donald gets his moment on the super-high, super-fast Affirmation while, in Jason Orange's hidden track Flower Bed, Price creates a shimmering wall of sound. Williams' vocals are the most prominent on Progress and, on the surface, it's the first Take That album not dominated by Barlow. But don't be fooled. Williams now calls his former nemesis ""the captain"" while Barlow has confirmed he ""still leads the trail"". His musical input into this album, as with all Take That releases, is vast. For all the progress made in the latest gear change of the Take That rollercoaster, Gary Barlow is still the leader of the band that was formed around him. Progress is released in the UK on Monday.",Robbie Williams says he left Take That because his attempts to become a more creative member of the band were thwarted.
"The broadcaster and artist received multiple standing ovations from the audience at the Rolf Harris Live show in Bristol on Saturday. The 83-year-old entertainer thanked fans for their support. ""You've no idea what this means - for you all to turn up with such support and such enthusiasm,"" he told the audience. Harris was first interviewed under caution in November 2012 over historical allegations of sexual offences. He was then arrested and bailed in March 2013. He has not been charged with any offence. He also told the crowd about a letter of support he had received. ""A couple called Helen and Matthew sent me a card of support which said: 'It's not about waiting for the storm to pass. It's about learning to dance in the rain'."" It was billed as a ""rare stage appearance"" and ""an opportunity to hear his classic songs including Stairway to Heaven, Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport, Sun Arise and Two Little Boys."" Harris, known for his passion for art as well as his broadcasting, also painted a picture on stage. The audience gave him a standing ovation when he walked onto the stage, followed by three more during the show. A review by Martin Booth from the Bristol Post said ""despite the current allegations surrounding him, he proved why he has been a consummate entertainer for the last five decades. ""Harris deserved every single one of his standing ovations,"" it added.",Entertainer Rolf Harris has performed his first live show since his arrest over historical sexual assault claims.
"Robert DeNiro and David Lynch were among those who attended the Hollywood ceremony to pay tribute to the 86-year-old, whose films include Young Frankenstein and The Producers. Accepting the award from director Martin Scorsese, Brooks said: ""Movies saved my life."" Woody Allen, Clint Eastwood and Steven Spielberg applauded Brooks via video. Actor Martin Short opened the good humoured ceremony at the Dolby Theatre with a song-and-dance routine set to a medley of melodies from Brooks' films. ""The word genius is used a lot in Hollywood, so I might as well call Mel one,'' Short said. Also in attendance, Larry David blamed Brooks for his idle years as an aspiring comedian. ""Mel Brooks didn't get me into comedy, he kept me away from it,"" David said, recalling how he was intimidated by Brooks' talent. ""I spent years doing nothing because of him,"" he added. Past recipients of the prize include Scorsese, Elizabeth Taylor, Kirk Douglas, Spielberg and George Lucas. ""We are going to miss you so much, Mel,"" joked comedian Jimmy Kimmel. ""You were one of the greats. Rest in peace, my friend,"" he added. Brooks responded, directing an expletive at Kimmel during his acceptance speech, adding, ""I'm not gonna die."" He went on to thank the institute for recognizing him and sharing his lifelong love of film. ""Movies,"" he said, ""rescued my soul. No matter what was bad or wrong, it could be wiped out on Saturday morning.'' Scorsese included Brooks in the same category as the Marx Brothers and Laurel & Hardy. ""Mel has made his own tradition of greatness, and it's that tradition - drawing from the past, honouring it, toying with it, vamping on it, extending it to places wise men, very funny men previously feared to go - that's what we're celebrating here and honouring tonight. ""Mel has always made his own way, and he brought us all along for the joyride,' Scorsese added. In 1969, Brooks won an Oscar for writing The Producers, a comedy about two schemers who figure out how to make money by producing a sure-fire Broadway flop - a musical about Adolf Hitler.",Comic film director Mel Brooks has been honoured with a lifetime achievement award from the American Film Institute.
"His previous Oscar victories were for his work in My Left Foot and There Will Be Blood - and he has two further nominations to his name, for Gangs Of New York and In The Name Of The Father. ""I need to have a lie down now for a couple of years!"" he joked backstage after he accepting his latest award. Born in London in 1957, the son of the Anglo-Irish poet Cecil Day-Lewis and actress Jill Balcon, Day-Lewis studied at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre school. A method actor, he is known for his attention to detail and devotion to the roles he plays. His film debut came at the age of 14, an uncredited part in John Schlesinger's Sunday Bloody Sunday, in which he played a vandal. During his early 20s, the young actor worked in both stage and screen, including How Many Miles to Babylon and a small part in the Academy award winning film, Gandhi in 1982. A year later, Day-Lewis joined the Royal Shakespeare Company, with starring roles as Romeo in Romeo and Juliet and Flute in A Midsummer Night's Dream. A role in the 1985 British comedy drama, My Beautiful Laundrette about the relationships between members of Asian and White communities, was followed by a part alongside Juliette Binoche in The Unbearable Lightness of Being in 1987. But it was his award-winning performance as Christy Brown in Jim Sheridan's acclaimed 1989 film My Left Foot, in which he showed his skills as a method actor and won him his first best actor Oscar. Day-Lewis prepared for the role as a paralysed man by visiting and forming friendships with disabled people at Dublin's Sandymount School Clinic. He also refused to break character during filming. He took the same approach to his preparation for the portrayal of Gerry Conlon in In the Name of the Father, Sheridan's film about the wrongly convicted Guildford Four. Off screen, Day-Lewis kept his northern Irish accent as well as losing weight for the part and spending time in a jail cell. The role earned him several award nominations including a second Oscar nod. After roles in Martin Scorsese's The Age of Innocence and a film version of Arthur Miller's The Crucible, Day-Lewis returned to work with Sheridan in The Boxer, a film about a former boxer and IRA member released from prison. To prepare for the part, the actor trained with former boxing world champion Barry McGuigan. After a five-year break from acting, Day-Lewis took the part of the gang leader Bill the Butcher in Scorsese's 2002 historical drama Gangs of New York, which earned him his third Academy Award nomination and the Bafta for best actor. His powerful performance in Paul Thomas Anderson's critically acclaimed There Will Be Blood (2007) won him his second Oscar award for best actor along with a host of other awards including a Bafta and Golden Globe. Rejection letter Lincoln marked his first collaboration with Steven Spielberg. The role was not always his - Liam Neeson was originally in place to play the American president. Even when he dropped out, Day-Lewis turned down the role. When Day-Lewis eventually picked up best actor at the New York Film Critics Circle, Spielberg read out his star's original rejection letter. ""Dear Steven,"" he wrote. ""It was a real pleasure just to sit and talk with you. I listened very carefully to what you had to say about this compelling history, and I've since read the script and found it in all the detail in which it describes these monumental events and in the compassionate portraits of all the principal characters, both powerful and moving. ""I can't account for how at any given moment I feel the need to explore one life as opposed to another, but I do know that I can only do this work if I feel almost as if there is no choice; that a subject coincides inexplicably with a very personal need and a very specific moment in time. ""In this case, as fascinated as I was by Abe, it was the fascination of a grateful spectator who longed to see a story told, rather than that of a participant. ""That's how I feel now in spite of myself, and though I can't be sure that this won't change, I couldn't dream of encouraging you to keep it open on a mere possibility. "" Eventually, he did change his mind - and made the role his own, painstakingly researching the gait and accent of the much-mythologised American President. He grew his own beard - ""it was a little scratchy now and then"" - and, reportedly, stayed in character during filming. Partly, this was because he was aware of the scrutiny his performance would be under. ""It had a paralysing quality that if we got it wrong, I might never show my face in this country again,"" he told reporters at the Oscars. But the star is neither as serious nor as intense as his reputation suggests. Winning the Bafta earlier this year, Day-Lewis mocked his reputation, joking that he had stayed ""in character as myself for the past 55 years"", just in case he had to accept such an award. And, as he accepted his historic Oscar trophy from Meryl Streep, he said: ""Three years ago, before we decided to do a straight swap, I had been committed to play Margaret Thatcher... ""Meryl was Steven's first choice for Lincoln. I'd like to see that version.""","Daniel Day-Lewis, has made history by becoming the only person to win an Oscar in the best actor category on three occasions."
"By Tamara KovacevicBBC News Honeyland is the first film to compete for both the best documentary award and best international feature film. The documentary's success is even more remarkable because it started almost accidentally. Macedonian directors Tamara Kotevska and Ljubo Stefanov were researching in a remote mountainous area of the country for a short nature documentary. They noticed beehives behind a rock on the mountain where they were filming. This led them to Hatidze Muratova, one of Europe's last wild beekeepers, who uses ancient methods passed down through the generations for harvesting wild honey. This was the beginning of a ""crazy adventure"" of three years, filming through scorching summers and freezing winters. After another year editing, their first feature film was born. Honeyland chronicles a period of Hatidze's life when her ancient methods of beekeeping came up against, and conflicted with, those of a newcomer to her remote home region. The directors say the film profoundly changed their lives. Honeyland has much to say about conserving nature, but its lessons are also about human life and relationships. Sharing to survive ""Half for me and half for you"" is Hatidze's mantra, which she repeats as she tends to the bees on the mountain. But it's a message which is in danger of being lost in the modern world. Hatidze lives in Bekirlija, an abandoned village with no electricity, running water or roads, where she looks after her ailing mother. The honey she sells at the market in the capital of North Macedonia, Skopje, is her sole source of income. She takes only half of the honey, leaving the rest for the bees. She lives by that simple principle. ""Sharing with bees and with nature is the key to her survival,"" says Stefanov. But her quiet existence is fundamentally changed when the nomadic Sam family, consisting of parents with seven unruly children, a noisy vehicle and a large herd of cattle, moves into the village. When the Sam family arrives, she welcomes them with an open heart, and teaches them how to harvest the wild honey. However, Hussein, the father of the family, wants to harvest honey on a larger scale and for more profit. He takes all the honey from his own hives, but his bees respond to this by attacking Hatidze's hives, leading to their destruction, and a conflict between the human neighbours. Kotevska says that the directors do not want to portray the Sam family as symbols of destruction, but merely as ""the mirror to all of us who make bad decisions"", based on the need to survive and provide. Wisdom can be more powerful than force ""To be able to communicate with bees you need to have a personal strength to approach them, patience to learn how to tame them, and this way of life requires not force but wisdom,"" says Kotevska. She says that beekeeping has made Hatidze such a remarkable person. Hatidze gets very close to the bees, often using no protection. She does not get stung, the bees seem to trust her. ""Everything we've heard from Hatidze refers to bees. She has been working with the bees all her life and everything she has learned, she learned from them."" The directors say that wild beekeeping was something that only a few people in the region learned how to do. It was never the main source of income for the villagers, but the families passed it down through generations. In Hatidze's family, learning the skill skipped a generation - she learned it as a girl from her grandfather, rather than her parents. You can be alone but not lonely ""Hatidze acts with the bees as if they were her family and she takes care of them as if they were her children,"" says Kotevska. ""And through that, even though her life is very harsh, Hatidze doesn't feel lonely."" In one scene of the film, Hatidze asks her mother why she turned down offers of marriage that were brought for Hatidze. Nazife says she did not turn them down, but Hatidze's late father did. Stefanov says that in the traditional communities in that part of the world, regardless of the religion or ethnicity, ""there is an unwritten rule that the last-born female child stays with the parents until their death"". ""So, Hatidze's destiny was to stay and take care of her parents."" But Hatidze was longing for her own family. In the film, she develops a special bond with one of the Sam boys. ""The love that she was keeping for a family of her own, that never came true, eventually went to the bees,"" says Kotevska. ""She finds happiness and companionship in every living creature around her. She will continue to find happiness again and again as long as she lives."" Pictures can speak more loudly than words Honeyland is a film set in a remote land, where the people live in ways unfamiliar in the West. But it has still connected with a worldwide audience through the protagonists' body language, relationships and emotions. Both the Sams and Hatidze's family are ethnic Turks and they speak in Turkish dialect throughout the film. In the past, there were about 10 Turkish villages in the area, Stefanov says, but most villagers left for Turkey after World War Two. Today, about 78,000 ethnic Turks still live in North Macedonia, making up just under 4% of the country's population of 2.1 million. ""Not understanding Turkish was a problem during the shooting, but we decided to let them speak as they naturally would,"" says Kotevska. ""When we came to editing, we spent a week or more just being completely stuck. We spent hours just thinking what to do with this material. In the end we came up with the best possible solution and that's to edit on mute. This gave us the power of the visual story that we made. ""This was the most valuable lesson for us as the authors of the future films. We are now very trained to see the stories that are created visually."" Kotevska says there were many other disadvantages from the beginning of the shooting but most of them ended up working out well. ""They make you extremely creative, we thought of the solutions that turned out to be quite unique."" Bees and humans are similar Hatidze says her bees are uniquely resilient and can survive very high and very low temperature, unlike many other species. The film shows that to be true of the people living in the region too. But the similarities between people and bees do not stop there. What caught the directors' interest early on was observing Hatidze's life and her relationship with her mother. Kotevska says they were struck by how similar Hatidze was to a worker bee and how her mother resembled the queen bee. In the film, Nazife never leaves the house, but her wisdom guides her daughter at the time of crisis. A conflict played out between human neighbours is also mirrored by the bees. ""The Sam family that comes later are the other group of bees who are attacking the previous group of bees, which is Hatidze and her family. We really enjoyed making this comparison during the shooting."" It is well known that male and female bees fill very different roles, but the film shows everybody doing the same jobs. Hussein, his wife and the children all share the roles around the cattle. In one scene, one of the young sons is shown helping a cow give birth, while another boy attempts milking with his father nearby. Kotevska and Stefanov say that, like beekeeping, all the other jobs in this harsh environment have been done equally by men and women. ""Everyone has to do the same work to survive. You can see this in our film - in both families, it doesn't make a difference what [gender] they are, they all doing the same things."" And, like the jobs in the village of Bekirlija, the making of the film was shared between Stefanov and Kotevska, who is one of only a handful of female directors to be nominated for an Oscar this year. Kotevska says that many people assume that she, as a woman, was the one who was closer to Hatidze, and Stefanov with the boys from the other family. In fact it was the other way round. ""It's important who we were as people, our personalities, this was crucial. Gender shouldn't be the topic of discussion."" Neon lights cannot match North Macedonia stars Hatidze has travelled to Hollywood for the Oscars ceremony, and she has also been to several other film festivals, in places as far apart as New York, Switzerland, Sarajevo and Turkey. But Kotevska's main impression of Los Angeles is: ""From the tall buildings, I cannot see the stars."" The film has already enabled Kotevska and Stefanov to buy Hatidze a house in another village, close to her brother's family. Nevertheless she still spends the bee season in her old village. The untouched nature of Hatidze's home couldn't be further away from the glitz and glamour of film festivals. After Hollywood, she will head there again in the spring and watch the stars from her little stone hut. All pictures from Honeyland (directors: Tamara Kotevska and Ljubo Stefanov) are NEON copyright, unless otherwise stated","One of the more unlikely films competing in this weekend's Oscars is a fascinating story about a wild beekeeper in the Balkans. Honeyland has a strong ecological message, but it's the life story of the woman at the centre of the film that has struck a chord around the world."
"Actor Benedict Cumberbatch said he was ""honoured"" to see his portrayal of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's sleuth voted top by viewers in seven countries. He continued: ""Who would have thought a high-functioning sociopath could be so popular... all over the world?"" Another poll of iconic BBC moments saw Sherlock seemingly falling to his death score more than a quarter of the vote. That put the ending of 2012's Reichenbach Fall episode streets ahead of Monty Python's Dead Parrot sketch, its closest competitor. The BBC Worldwide Showcase poll surveyed more than 7,000 people from Australia, France, Germany, India, Japan, Mexico and the United States. Almost 30% of respondents put Sherlock Holmes top, ahead of the Doctor of Doctor Who fame, Idris Elba's Luther, Fawlty Towers' Basil and Top Gear's Stig. Ab Fab's Patsy Stone is the highest ranking woman in the list - though that may change if the next Doctor is female, or if it turns out The Stig has been keeping something from us. Other characters on the Top 10 include Edmund Blackadder, Hyacinth Bucket from Keeping Up Appearances and the Vicar of Dibley. Basil Fawlty makes another appearance in the Top 10 of most iconic BBC moments, thanks to the Gourmet Night episode in which he attacks his car. Other moments singled out include Colin Firth's Mr Darcy emerging from a lake in Pride and Prejudice and David Brent's ""dancing"" in The Office.

"The film, written by JK Rowling and starring Eddie Redmayne as Newt Scamander, took a total of £15.3m. It is the third highest opening weekend from the JK Rowling series, behind the two final Harry Potter films. Warner Bros executive Josh Berger said: ""We are thrilled with the huge response from British and Irish audiences."" The film also worked its magic at North American cinemas, taking an estimated $75m (£61m) over the weekend - more than the rest of the US box office top 10 combined. 'Positive reviews' Harry Potter creator Rowling has planned scripts for a total of five films in the series. The first instalment is set in New York, and tells the story of a fictional author mentioned in the Potter stories. Redmayne plays the part of the animal-loving magizoologist Newt Scamander, who visits New York's secret community of witches and wizards. The film is set 70 years before Harry Potter reads his book at his school, Hogwarts. It has received broadly positive reviews from critics. The opening weekend haul in the US and Canada was lower than for any of the Harry Potter films, however. Elsewhere in the box office charts, Benedict Cumberbatch's Doctor Strange fell to second with $17.7m (£14.3m), with Trolls third on $17.5m (£14.1m). Sci-fi movie Arrival, starring Amy Adams, took fourth spot with $11.8m (£9.5m), while the comedy Almost Christmas, starring Danny Glover and Gabrielle Union, rounded out the top five with $7m (£5.7m).

"The streaming giant said 82 million households around the world tuned into the show in its first 28 days online, surpassing the firm's own projections. The show hit the number one spot in 83 countries, including the US, UK, India, France and Brazil. Bridgerton star Phoebe Dynevor described the news as ""utterly insane"". ""I'm SO proud of the incredible team behind this show! And thank you guys for loving it,"" the 25-year-old actor, who played Daphne Bridgerton, wrote on Instagram. Regé-Jean Page, whose performance as love interest the Duke of Hastings won him fans around the world, also celebrated the news. Bridgerton's colourful costumes, wisteria-fronted homes and entertaining storylines were celebrated globally as many fans turned to the show at the end of a year marked by coronavirus. Adapted from a series of historical romance novels by author Julia Quinn, the drama follows members of the Bridgerton family as they navigate London's high society in the 1800s. But it was Page and Dynevor's depictions of the Duke and Duchess's tumultuous relationship that catapulted them to fame while their raunchy sex scenes raised some eyebrows. Executive producer Shonda Rhimes was widely praised for her ""colour-blind casting"" which put black actors in the type of historical roles that were traditionally filled by white actors. The show was designed for today's millennial and Gen Z audiences and has been described as a Regency-era Gossip Girl. Netflix defines a ""view"" as any piece of content watched for at least two minutes - meaning its numbers are not comparable to traditional TV viewing figures. Netflix said Bridgerton had made the top 10 in every country it operates in except Japan. The previous record for most-watched debut series on the platform was held by fantasy drama The Witcher, which Netflix said was watched by 76 million households in its first 28 days. Jinny Howe, vice-president of original series at Netflix, said Bridgerton ""defies tradition, and demonstrates that period dramas are not limited in scope or audience"". ""The empowerment of people of colour and women made Bridgerton feel accessible and contemporary, resonating with audiences all around the world,"" she wrote in a blog post. The show has been renewed for a second series.","Stars of the period drama Bridgerton have thanked fans after Netflix announced that the show had become its ""biggest series ever""."
"12 Years a Slave and Nebraska are also nominated for its 'outstanding producer of theatrical motion pictures' award. The Butler and Coen brothers movie Inside Llewyn Davis are notably absent from the 10 films, one of which will collect the prize on 19 January. The guild's decision comes six weeks before the Oscars on 2 March. In the last six years, the recipient of the PGA's top award has gone on to be named best picture at the Academy Awards. Argo, which took the main prize at last year's ceremony, was also the top dog at the 2012 Oscars. Eight of the 10 films nominated by the Producers Guild last year went on to be nominated in the Academy Awards' best picture category. Other cinematic releases in contention include Woody Allen's Blue Jasmine, Martin Scorsese's The Wolf of Wall Street and Tom Hanks thriller Captain Phillips. Fact-based Aids drama Dallas Buyers Club, Spike Jonze's oddball romance Her and Saving Mr Banks, in which Tom Hanks also appears, round out the PGA shortlist. But there is no place for August: Orange County, a darkly comic family drama starring Julia Roberts and Meryl Streep, or Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom biopic starring Idris Elba as Nelson Mandela. Despite this, US producer Harvey Weinstein - whose company is distributing both films as well as the Dame Judi Dench drama Philomena - remained upbeat about their Oscar chances. ""We've been so lucky,"" he told the BBC on Friday, saying the films he is handling had a ""great showing"" in both the Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild nominations. ""It is Bafta and the Academy [of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences] that count the most. Let's see what happens there."" ""This is a big year,"" Weinstein added.

"By Emma SaundersEntertainment reporter This time we can relax - following last year's controversial move to Channel 4 from the BBC, our worst fears weren't realised. Sandi Toksvig and Noel Fielding had more chemistry than Heston Blumenthal's egg and bacon ice cream and Prue proved a fine replacement for her baking pal Mary Berry. And ol' blue eyes, aka Paul Hollywood, was there to steady the ship. This year, the Bake Off team are trying something new - having previously experimented with gluten-free bakes, the forthcoming series will feature a vegan week. ""Veganism seems to be growing and we wanted to represent that,"" Paul tells the BBC. But there won't be any allowances for the lack of eggs and dairy. ""You can't just say: 'It's okay for vegan [food].' It has to taste good, period,"" Paul explains. But when asked if he would consider going vegan, there's a stunned silence before he asks incredulously: ""Are you joking?"" So creme ""pate"" and Genoese sponge are very much still on the menu. Here are 13 - that's a baker's dozen, don't you know - other things we learned about the new series (we don't give too much away but if you really want to steer clear of any Bake Off revelations ahead of the first show, look away now). 1. THAT tweet. How could we forget the moment when Prue tweeted the name of last year's winner before the final had aired? Well, let's just say they don't shy away from the unfortunate event in the first episode's opening scene. In fact, it's pretty prominent. We don't want to spoil the surprise but Prue and Noel ARE in costume and if you like classic 80s movies, you won't be disappointed. Prue is now comfortable with her tweeting controversy. ""I'll know I'm a has-been when people stop telling me not to tweet,"" she jokes. Paul certainly isn't letting her forget it - when England were playing in the World Cup during filming and they wanted to wait to watch it on catch-up after a long day on set, Paul told Prue: ""I'm going to text you the result before you get back."" 2. Paul Hollywood really IS scary Prue was ""hugely relieved"" the first series was a success. ""I only got nervous when I realised how important it [Bake Off] was! I've judged food all my life so I was never nervous about the actual job [but] I was a bit frightened of Paul Hollywood."" (You're not alone, Prue.) The culinary entrepreneur admits she's very comfortable bathing in the GBBO spotlight. ""I'm such an egotist, I love it! I can't tell you what it does for my street cred with my grandchildren."" 3. The hot weather is the baker's foe - again Every year, pretty much without fail, there's at least one episode where the heat in the tent causes serious baking issues. Chocolate and butter start melting under the pressure, along with the contestants. But surely this year's long-running heatwave proved more troublesome than usual? ""There were a couple of challenges where the weather came into effect,"" Paul admits but he's not giving anything else away. Sorry. 4. Danish pastry anyone? It's not just vegan week that's new this year - there will also be a Danish week. Paul says ""it seemed apt with Sandi (who is half Danish) - we asked her for ideas."" Mmm, we're thinking berries, apple, cinnamon and custard. Not necessarily in that order. 5. The ones to watch There are a dozen bakers hoping to win and it's early days of course but here are our favourites so far: Rahul - a nuclear research scientist no less. Who can't stop talking. Paul can't get a word in edgeways. Neither can Sandy. And he has a lovely ""chubby little face"". Paul's words, not ours. Antony - could be this year's Selasi. Laid back, funny and cool as a cucumber. Unlike the temperature in the tent during this year's heatwave. Manon - she's French. Therefore, brilliant at baking. Obviously. And calls Wagon Wheels Wheelie Wagons. Too cute. Terry - elder statesman (ok, so he's only 56) with an amazing moustache. Former air steward and prosthetic technician who has his own microbrewery. We're hooked already. Moreover, he's the only one to use a 3D technique in the first technical challenge. Terry, we salute you. Ruby - wears her heart on her sleeve and her feelings on her face. If there are going to be any showdowns with Paul, we have a feeling Rubes might be in the mix (geddit?) Karen - Yorkshire lass who Paul describes as a cross between Su Pollard and Dame Edna (ok, that's how he describes her signature bake but it is a self-portrait). 6. The rude bits Laugh-out-loud moment of the first episode? Don't miss Kim-Joy's classic take on Dan's big biscuit. That's all we're saying. And if you're worried there's not quite enough innuendo in episode one, Prue tells us: ""Don't worry, you'll get some."" (Fnarr fnarr). Paul suggests there should be an outtakes show post-11pm for the really rude stuff - we NEED that commission! 7. Noel's naughty tricks Sadly for us, Prue says she's ""learning to be discreet"" after Tweetgate. Which means she won't reveal what tricks Noel plays on her and Paul off camera: ""I'm not going to say them in public!"" But Paul says he and Noel's ""humour is very similar"". Frightening. 8. Noel the musician Noel serenades Prue regularly with his own special version of Chris Isaac's Wicked Game: ""I never dreamed that I'd love somebody like Prue."" Who knew? He's also seen sporting an Elvis-inspired hair-do in episode one. And Paul says we'll see quite a few changes to Noel's barnet as the weeks go by. 9. The Fab Four all like each other outside the tent - really They usually eat (and drink!) together after a shoot. And they have a WhatsApp chat group. We want to join. ""Sandi and Noel are really funny and exactly the same off set as on,"" says Prue, to our relief. 10. Is Paul mellowing? ""I wanted to go back to basics to a point - we want to get the general public baking, so on the challenges, we reined it back a little bit [this year]. We've given a little bit more information on the more challenging technicals."" And you may see some more of his famous handshakes: ""I give a handshake when they deserve one - there are quite a few this year."" 11. The Jaffa Cake debate is over Master baker Paul Hollywood says they ARE biscuits although sadly, he ""can't quite fit them"" in his tea for a dunk. 12. The first showstopper challenge is... drumroll... A biscuit selfie. Yep, you heard that right. Bit gimmicky but who cares? So what would Paul's selfie biccie look like? Prue suggests he'd be on a motorbike and would ""have a squashy middle"". Ouch. But Paul doesn't entirely disagree: ""Crispy and hard on the outside, a little bit soft on the inside."" Bless. 13. Trying the challenges themselves Prue says she likes to try things out herself - well, it's only fair. ""I quite often bake it [the technical challenge] the week before so I know what I'm talking about. A lot of these things - it's years since I baked them. And then I quite often bake things after the show, I will get the recipes [from the contestants]. Paul kindly puts the onus on us: ""People should challenge themselves at home, put the timer on, bake it and put it on Twitter."" Paul, you make it sound so simple.

"By Mark SavageBBC music reporter Releases by popular acts including Sistar, IU, Monsta X and Epik High have vanished, leaving fans frustrated. Spotify said its ""existing licensing deal"" with Kakao M had ""come to an end"" but it hoped the disruption would be temporary. But the Korean company accused Spotify of refusing to extend its licence. Kakao M is South Korea's top music distributor, responsible for 37.5% of the songs featured in the country's Top 400 Yearly Song Chart in 2020. It also owns and operates the country's top music streaming service, MelOn, with 8.81 million monthly active users. 'Fans suffer' The dispute prompted anger from some of the artists whose work was affected. ""Why is it always the artists and the fans that suffer when businesses place greed over art?"" said Tablo, the leader and producer of hip-hop band Epik High. He said the sudden removal of their most recent album, January's Epik High Is Here (Part 1), was ""against our will"". The music remains available on services like Deezer and Apple Music. The dispute illustrates the transient nature of subscribers' streaming libraries. Although 60,000 songs are uploaded to Spotify every day, popular tracks can disappear overnight when the company's agreements with record labels and rights-holders expire. Users will then see songs ""greyed out"" in their playlists. And it's not just Spotify - any streaming service can remove or replace music without notifying you as deals expire and are re-negotiated. We're more used to it on video-streaming apps like Netflix and Amazon Prime, where movies and TV shows shuffle on and off the menu on a monthly basis; but music streamers tend to offer a more stable library. In a statement, Spotify confirmed Kakao M's music was no longer available worldwide. ""Despite our best efforts, the existing licensing deal we had with Kakao M (which covered all countries other than South Korea) has come to an end,"" it said. ""The fact that we have not yet reached agreement on a new global deal is unfortunate for their artists, as well as for fans and listeners worldwide. It is our hope that this disruption will be temporary and we can resolve the situation soon."" However, later that same morning, Kakao M countered with its own statement, in which it claimed that Spotify had been the one who chose not to renew their agreement, even after a request on Kakao M's part. 'Billions of streams lost' It suggested the move was linked to ongoing conversations over the availability of their music on the South Korean version of Spotify, which launched four weeks ago. ""Unrelated to the domestic contract, which we are still negotiating, we separately received notice of the expiration of our license on February 28, and we requested a renewal of our existing global contract. ""Due to Spotify's policy that they must proceed with the domestic and global contracts at the same time, our global contract has currently expired,"" it continued. ""We are currently continuing our negotiations about the supply of music."" Among the artists whose discographies have at least partially disappeared are IU, Seventeen, Nu'est, Mamamoo, Epik High, Monsta X, Apink, Zico, Block B, Lovelyz, Brave Girls, CNBlue, Younha and many others. Twitter user @Lemonphobic has compiled a running list of those who are affected.

Mr Clash, 52, who has operated Elmo since the 1980s, said he was ""relieved"" the allegation had been dropped. On Monday, Sesame Street producers said they were satisfied the accuser's claim of under-age sex was ""unsubstantiated"". Sesame Street had given Mr Clash a leave of absence as he took action to protect his reputation. Mr Clash did not deny the relationship, but said it happened after the young man was an adult. ""I am relieved that this painful allegation has been put to rest,"" he said in a statement on Tuesday. ""I will not discuss it further."" Sesame Street said in a statement it was ""pleased that this matter has been brought to a close"". The show did not say when it expected Mr Clash to return to work. The accuser contacted the Sesame Street Workshop in June, claiming he had been in a relationship with the puppeteer that started when he was 16. ""We conducted a thorough investigation and found the allegation of under-age conduct to be unsubstantiated,"" the Sesame Street Workshop said in a statement on Monday.

"By Ian YoungsArts & entertainment reporter The latest episode, which has suddenly become the revived sitcom's finale, was the most-watched comedy on US TV last week. There has been much sympathy for Barr's co-stars including John Goodman and Laurie Metcalfe, who now find themselves without a show. Lena Dunham and Mindy Kaling are among those who have offered to write spin-offs for them. So what might the future hold for the cast and for Roseanne herself? Roseanne without Roseanne? TV network ABC has simply said the show, which was revived in March after 21 years off air, has been cancelled. But there are lots of calls for it to carry on - just without its lead character. Mindy Kaling, creator and star of The Mindy Project and one of the hottest names in US TV, jumped in with an offer to ""write things"" for Goodman and Metcalf, who play Roseanne's husband Dan and sister Jackie. Lena Dunham followed that by offering to ""do the spin off of your show starring Darlene's cool kids"". Roseanne herself tweeted that she was ""sick"" about the fact ABC had also thrown out ""two of the greatest actors in the world"". Variety has reported that ""there have been extremely preliminary discussions among key players about options for keeping the ensemble together in some form without Roseanne Barr"". Could they write Roseanne out? Her name may be on the tin, but anything is possible in TV. Goodman's character was written back in for the revival after dying of a heart attack in the original finale in 1997. He shrugged off the miraculous return in the first few minutes of the comeback, telling his screen wife that he was just asleep, not dead. Perhaps they could follow that example in reverse and have a passing reference to the fact her character has died. There are precedents for hit TV shows carrying on without their main stars. In the 1980s, a sitcom called Valerie was changed to Valerie's Family when its original star Valerie Harper was written out following a pay dispute with producers. And House of Cards is having another series without Kevin Spacey, who was obviously dispatched for very different reasons. What about Roseanne? Variety reported: ""One big problem to overcome [with continuing the show] is the fact that Barr has a significant financial interest in the series, and there is concern that a new iteration that would benefit her financially would be a non-starter for everyone involved."" Roseanne herself has suggested she may not take the cancellation lying down, saying the support she's received makes her ""feel like fighting back"". Meanwhile, talk show host Jimmy Kimmel has called for understanding that ""mental health issues are real"" and that ""the Roseanne I know could probably use some compassion and help right now"". Beyond the sitcom that bears her name, Roseanne is now unlikely to find work in the mainstream media but won't be short of offers from conservative outlets. The Daily Beast has reported that former Trump campaign aide Michael Caputo, who is planning an online streaming start-up, said he would ""reach out to Roseanne immediately"". British right-wing commentator Katie Hopkins tweeted in solidarity, saying: ""I have found the more I am fired, the busier I become."" Yahoo! TV critic Ken Tucker speculated that she might even fancy another shot at becoming president. Six years ago, she failed to gain the presidential nomination for the Green Party and ended up running for the Peace and Freedom Party. Tucker added that she now ""has the Trump playbook as a guide"". And Roseanne pledged to use the attention surrounding the furore to build her profile as ""a fighter 4 fairness in all aspects of US life"". Not just the cast Her co-stars may have had the most sympathy following the show's cancellation, but many more people are rethinking their career plans. ""I just want to apologise to the hundreds of people, and wonderful writers (all liberal) and talented actors who lost their jobs on my show due to my stupid tweet,"" Roseanne reportedly tweeted, although the tweet appears to have been deleted. The show's writers returned to work on the show's new season on the day it was cancelled, ABC News reported. ""None of us were in the frame of mind to start writing the show under the circumstances,"" showrunner Dave Caplan told the network's news site. ""We got together as a group for the first time and there was a lot of bittersweet hellos - and a couple hours later, a lot of very difficult goodbyes."" ABC counts its losses The Hollywood Reporter said ABC is likely to face a bill of ""tens of millions of dollars"" for the cancellation. It said Metcalf, Goodman and Sara Gilbert, who plays Darlene, negotiated deals worth $300,000 (£225,000) per episode for the planned next series, up from $250,000 (£187,000), and will expect to be compensated for at least 10 episodes, even if they are not made. Variety reported that ""the highest echelon of writers and producers also have some minimum episodic guarantees"". Ad revenue for the next season was due to be worth at least $60m (£45m), the Hollywood Reporter estimated.

"By Lauren TurnerEntertainment reporter Saoirse Ronan is talking about Lady Bird, the character she plays in the film of the same name - but she might as well be talking about herself. It's seen her win her third Oscar nomination, the first having come when she was just 13, for Atonement. She's already won the Golden Globe for best actress for the role, sweetly FaceTiming her mum from the audience so she could watch too. Lady Bird is Greta Gerwig's directorial debut and has seen her become only the fifth woman nominated for a best director Oscar. It's been almost universally praised for its realistic, but affectionate, look at the life of a teenager on the verge of leaving home and her relationship with her mother - and it's also up for best film. No wonder then that Saoirse is looking so happy and relaxed. Her silver strappy platforms have been taken off and she's sitting on the floor of a hotel suite, eating sushi. ""Is it cold in here?"" she ponders, going over to the thermostat before settling back on the carpet. We talked to her about how Saved by the Bell was her inspiration for the role, why she wanted to change her own name - and why she's like Beyonce. Congratulations on the Oscar nomination. What attracted you to the role of Lady Bird? Lady Bird is very much her own person. She doesn't follow the pack. She's very driven, she has a very strong sense of self. One of the things that's unusual for female leads, especially in a film about a teenager, is that she believes in herself, you know? Even if she doesn't know what she wants to be or what it is she wants to say, she knows she's going to do something. She's very committed to being herself. The film is made up of these little moments between a family and friends and within relationships. It's set in a time for this young person, and for her family, where everything is moving a little faster than they'd like - and they can't quite catch up with it. That's just what the end of childhood is like. It's gone before you can fully grasp what it was that happened. How was that similar, or not, to what it was like being a teenager for you? The insecurity she had and the hope she had - that feeling of needing to leave home in order to find yourself - was something I could really identify with and really relate to. And the need for a strong friendship to anchor you. When it came to the whole American high school experience - that was something I knew nothing about. The only thing I had to draw from was Saved by the Bell and Sabrina the Teenage Witch - American high school shows. The way the mother-daughter relationship is portrayed is really realistic. How did you approach it? You're watching two people that really love each other. There is a lot they share which is lovely and fun and it's sort of being overwhelmed by the mother's fear of change and the kid's desperation to get out and have something new. They're just missing each other, just by an inch. They just don't get each other. It's not that either one of them is necessarily out-and-out wrong, but they don't understand how the other one could think in the way that they do. It only takes time and life and experience and moving away to understand the other one. More so for the kid, I think. What did your mum think of the film - and what your on-screen mum Laurie Metcalf was like? She's the one that I call at the end of the day. She knows everything that's going on when I'm shooting because she's the one I speak to. She's like my real-life person when I'm doing that stuff. She was really struck by Laurie and how authentic she was as a mother. She's not playing the movie mom or anything - she's a real mother. The great thing about Laurie is that so many people would read a role like that and say, 'she's unlikeable' or 'she's the villain'. But Laurie knew that there was a goodness, there's such a goodness there and it comes from such a good place. Why are names so important in the film? When I was younger, nobody had my name. Even in Ireland, some people hadn't even heard of that name before. So for a while, I really didn't want it. I wanted to have a name just like everyone else - like Hannah, or Sarah. And then the older I got and the more sure I was of my personality and the kind of person I wanted to be, I was able to own it a little bit more. I get why musicians and people like that would take on a name in order to empower them. I think that's what it can do. Lady Bird, was - for Greta and I - she's like an alter ego a little bit. She's like our Sasha Fierce - we're Beyonce, obvs. You also hear about kids wanting to be called Spaceman or what was the one Phoebe had in Friends - Princess Consuela Banana Hammock? [She cracks up laughing at this point] What was it like working with Greta for the first time? I was a really, really huge fan of hers. Getting to meet her was a bit surreal for a second, because I love Frances Ha [which Gerwig appeared in] so much. It actually doesn't happen to me often with actors. But every now and again there's someone who really makes me feel the butterflies and Greta is one of those people. We met over a Skype call and we were just so giddy around each other. I hope we get to work together again and again, I can just see us properly collaborating. She was so great at guiding me but giving me the space to find my own way. Being a good director is the equivalent to being a good parent. How did you find out about your Oscar nomination? I was at my friend's house and she had been secretly looking at the nominations online. I had forgotten they were coming out. Eventually she pulled a load of confetti canons out of a tote bag and just went, 'pow!' and exploded them. I still didn't know what was going on and I had confetti all over me. Her mam ran in with balloons and more confetti - and then they told me. I was so, so happy. A few minutes later, she said 'Greta got nominated too'. As soon as I heard that, I just burst into tears. Out of everything, that's a change. It's insane that she's the fifth woman ever, just to be nominated. I'm so proud of her. She deserves it.

"The hit single, by Ronson and Bruno Mars, becomes the 158th track to reach the million mark in British charts history. Ronson said it was ""an amazing milestone to be in this club with all these massive superstars"". Earlier this month the single became the most-streamed track ever in the UK. Uptown Funk - which was rush-released after it was performed by X Factor runner up Fleur East in December - achieved 2.56m streams in a single week. However, its reign at the top of the charts appears to be over after Ellie Goulding's Love Me Like You Do held on to the top spot for a second week. The song, from the soundtrack to the Fifty Shades Of Grey film, became the UK's most listened to track on streaming services this week, notching up 2.25 million audio streams. Also the fastest-selling single of the year so far, Love Me Like You Do is Goulding's second number one. Hozier's Take Me To Church climbed back to number two - after 21 weeks on the chart - with Uptown Funk rounding out the top three. DJ Fresh's Gravity, featuring Ella Eyre, entered the charts at number four, and Rihanna, Kanye West and Paul McCartney's FourFiveSeconds completes the top five. Grammys surge In the album charts, Sam Smith's In The Lonely Hour regained pole position following his success at the Grammys last weekend - marking his 38th week in the top 10. Drake's If You're Reading This You're Too Late stole into third place following its surprise release on Friday, behind Ed Sheeran's X at number two. This week's top 20 albums offered some old faces and some new faces: acoustic singer-songwriter Jack Savoretti made his top 40 debut with Written In Scars at number 13; Grammy award-winning jazz singer Gregory Porter reached a personal high at number 10; and Alanis Morrisette's Jagged Little Pill re-entered the charts at number 16, 20 years after it was first released.","Mark Ronson's Uptown Funk has reached the one million sales mark, 10 weeks after it was first released, according to Official Charts Company data."
"The sixth series will introduce Kelly Macdonald as Detective Chief Inspector Joanne Davidson, the senior investigating officer of an unsolved murder. Written by Jed Mercurio, the series has earned a devoted following thanks to its shocking plot twists, edge-of-the-seat moments and starry ensemble. But if you haven't watched it before or need a reminder of the plot, look no further - here's a handy bluffer's guide to series one to five. Warning: this article contains plot spoilers. Do not read on if you do not want to find out what occurred in previous series of Line of Duty. SERIES ONE (2012) After refusing to participate in a cover-up, DS Steve Arnott (Martin Compston) is recruited by Superintendent Ted Hastings (Adrian Dunbar), head of anti-corruption unit AC-12. His first assignment is to investigate DCI Tony Gates (Lennie James), a high-flying officer with a suspiciously impressive success rate. With the help of undercover officer Kate Fleming (Vicky McClure), Arnott discovers Tony has indeed been covering up for a deadly hit and run. Realising his career is over, Tony takes his own life - but the corruption does not die with him. Another officer in his team, DS Matthew ""Dot"" Cottan (Craig Parkinson), is revealed to be an inside man for gangster John ""Tommy"" Hunter (Brian McCardle). Yet Dot - also known as ""The Caddy"" - is better than Tony at covering his tracks... Shocking moments: Tony's girlfriend Jackie (Gina McKee) having her throat cut; Arnott being tortured; Gates killing himself. Memorable dialogue: ""You take a shot at the king, make sure you kill him, son!"" (Tony Gates to Steve Arnott) A police convoy is ambushed by two gunmen who leave three officers dead and their prisoner hospitalised. The prisoner, who is later killed along with another officer, is revealed to be Tommy Hunter, who had been under witness protection. DI Lindsay Denton (Keeley Hawes), who had been in charge of the convoy, comes under suspicion and narrowly survives a murder attempt. It is later revealed that she's a pawn in a plan cooked up by Cottan and his criminal associates, who wanted Tommy silenced in order to protect Dot's secret identity. The series ends with Denton in prison and Cottan installed at AC-12, safely hiding in plain sight... Shocking moments: DC Georgia Trotman (Jessica Raine) being thrown out of a window; Denton attacking a neighbour with a bottle. Memorable dialogue: ""People have underestimated me my whole life!"" (Lindsay Denton) A police raid ends with Sergeant Danny Waldron (Daniel Mays) gunning down a suspect in cold blood, then making it look as if the dead man shot first. Danny is then himself killed, but not before alerting Fleming to the existence of a list of people involved in a child abuse ring. Finding the list and seeing Tommy Hunter's name on it, Cottan destroys it while making it look as if Steve is the mysterious ""Caddy"". But he is finally exposed by DI Denton who, having been acquitted of conspiracy to murder, dies at his hand emailing the list to AC-12. After a lengthy interrogation, Cottan escapes, only to die, semi-heroically, stopping Fleming being shot by one of his associates. The series ends with Steve returning to duty, the chief abuser being convicted and Kate receiving both a commendation and a promotion. Shocking moments: Danny's death scene; Cottan killing Denton; Cottan taking a bullet for Fleming. Memorable dialogue: ""We gather evidence and the people decide. They've decided she didn't do it because you couldn't keep it in your pants!"" (Kate Fleming to Steve Arnott) Under pressure to catch a serial killer, DCI Roz Huntley could do without forensic coordinator Tim Ifield (Jason Watkins) questioning the evidence against the suspect. He takes his concerns to AC-12 and Kate Fleming goes undercover to investigate Huntley. Suspecting Ifield has shopped her, Huntley confronts him at his home. Huntley returns to work with a concealed hand injury. Ifield is then discovered dead, with three fingers amputated. Taking charge of the crime scene, Huntley implicates Ifield in another murder. Her husband refuses to confirm her alibi and falls under suspicion himself. A man in a balaclava throws Steve Arnott down a flight of stairs. Huntley has to have her hand amputated and is arrested for killing Tim Ifield. Her solicitor is found to be linked to ""Balaclava Man"" - as is Huntley's boss, Assistant Chief Constable Derek Hilton. A recording of Cottan's deathbed declaration reveals he was promoted by a corrupt copper whose name begins with H. Is this the newly deceased Hilton... or could it be Ted Hastings? Shocking moments: Huntley and Ifield's fight; Arnott being attacked. Memorable dialogue: ""This is beginning to feel like a life's work!"" (Ted Hastings) When a police convoy is hijacked by an organised crime group (OCG), AC-12 suspect undercover police are involved. They're right. The raid was masterminded by DS John Corbett (Stephen Graham), who has been posing as a criminal in order to identify the mysterious H. Before Corbett can unmask H, he is betrayed by second-in-command Lisa McQueen (Rochenda Sandall) and brutally murdered. The ensuing fall-out sees Ted Hastings suspended, investigated and charged with conspiracy by DCS Patricia Carmichael (Anna Maxwell Martin). During a tense interrogation, Hastings turns the tables by exposing lawyer Gill Biggeloe (Polly Walker) as part of the OCG. The series ends with Hastings back in charge at AC-12, McQueen given immunity and Ryan Pilkington, Corbett's killer, inducted as a student police officer. Shocking moments: Corbett's murder; Biggeloe being attacked. Memorable dialogue: ""I'm just trying to get to the truth. The top brass, they don't want me to succeed!""

"Four decades on, the star of The Post and The Iron Lady is returning to the small screen - in Big Little Lies. Streep will join fellow Oscar winners Nicole Kidman and Reese Witherspoon in the hit HBO drama. According to HBO, Streep will play the mother of Alexander Skarsgard's character, ""concerned for the well-being of her grandchildren"". It's far from her first TV role though. Here are some of the other shows she has managed to fit in, when she's not starring in acclaimed movies and winning Oscars. The Simpsons In 1994 Meryl made a guest appearance in Springfield as Jessica Lovejoy, a reverend's daughter who briefly becomes Bart's girlfriend. Streep said she had accepted the role to impress her kids. ""It's given me more credibility in my home than anything I've ever done,"" she was quoted as saying at the time. King of the Hill Streep made another voice appearance five years later in a 1999 edition of Fox's animated sitcom. In A Beer Can Named Desire she played Esme Dauterive, a Louisiana matriarch and plantation owner with the thickest of Southern accents. Angels in America Streep won an Emmy, a Golden Globe and a SAG award for her multiple roles in HBO's epic adaptation of Tony Kushner's two-part play. The 2003 miniseries saw her play a variety of parts, among them a gay Mormon's mother, the ghost of Ethel Rosenberg and an impressively bearded Rabbi. Web Therapy Meryl has popped up in a number of episodes of Lisa Kudrow's improvised online comedy series as Camilla Bowner, a shrink who specialises in gay conversion therapy. ""She came up with the character, she showed up and she was unbelievably good,"" Kudrow told chat show host Jimmy Kimmel in 2012. The Nix In 2016 it was reported that Streep was set to star in a TV adaptation of Nathan Hill's bestseller about a woman whose attack on a presidential candidate prompts her estranged son to pen a tell-all biography. ""Nothing in Hollywood is set in stone until it's actually made, so we're kind of circling around it,"" said Hill last year. ""But hopefully, we'll get the green light."" Streep's casting in Big Little Lies marks something of a family reunion, given that Alexander Skarsgard's father Stellan played an old boyfriend of hers in 2008's Mamma Mia. Before Big Little Lies returns in 2019, Meryl will also be seen in Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again, the eagerly awaited sequel to her Abba-themed mega-smash. Speculation is swirling that Streep's dungaree-wearing Donna is now dead and only appears in the film in flashbacks. Take a look at the latest trailer and decide for yourself. Kidman - who has won a string of awards for her performance in Big Little Lies including an Emmy and Screen Actors Guild prize - welcomed Streep on Instagram. Laura Dern, who won a Golden Globe and an Emmy for her work in the show, also expressed delight at the news, saying her ""acting dream had come true"". Witherspoon, meanwhile, said she was ""beyond thrilled"" that Streep was joining the cast, adding that Monterey - the show's Californian setting - had ""better watch out"". Don't expect Streep to swear off film for good though. Currently to be seen in Oscar hopeful The Post, she'll be back on the big screen later this year in Mary Poppins Returns.

"Radu Dogaru's lawyer made the claim as the trial of the six-strong gang resumed in Bucharest. Artwork including pieces by Picasso and Monet were stolen from Rotterdam's Kunsthal museum last October. The works have been valued at around 18m euros (£15m; $24m). Last month, lawyers for the suspects said they would return the paintings in exchange for moving their trial to the Netherlands. Lawyer Catalin Dancu said that Dogaru had repeated the offer and told him ""If the Dutch don't want to take me, no one sees the paintings"". Speaking to the press in a break in the hearing he said Dogaru ""does not want to co-operate anymore with Romanian authorities because he does not trust the justice system in Romania"". The lawyer also said that, while Dogaru refused to say where the paintings were, he believed five of them had been moved. ""All the five paintings that were in Romania are now abroad, in the east. In my opinion, in Moldova,"" Dancu said. He said the other two stolen artworks were in Belgium, but gave no further details. There had been fears that some of the paintings had been destroyed. After Dogaru's arrest it was claimed his mother Olga had burned a number of them. This was later denied and Dancu reiterated on Tuesday that no paintings had been destroyed. The works were taken from the Kunsthal museum through a back entrance in an early morning raid that lasted less than three minutes. They include Monet's Waterloo Bridge, Picasso's Harlequin Head, Matisse's Reading Girl in White and Yellow and Lucien Freud's Woman with Eyes Closed. It was the Netherlands' biggest art theft since 20 works disappeared from Amsterdam's Van Gogh museum in 1991.

She was the Academy's first female president and, in an interview published this week, called her role ""the best job on the planet"". In a statement, the Recording Academy said: ""In light of concerns raised to the Recording Academy board of trustees, including a formal allegation of misconduct by a senior female member of the Recording Academy team, the board has placed Recording Academy president and CEO Deborah Dugan on administrative leave, effective immediately.

"By Tim MastersEntertainment and arts correspondent, BBC News The two-time Oscar- winning actor has often taken on roles that have required him to manipulate his weight, such as Castaway and A League Of Their Own. But he told the BBC those sort of roles were ""a young man's game"". Hanks is in the UK to promote sea piracy thriller Captain Phillips, which opened the London Film Festival. He added: ""I've talked to a number of actors who have gained weight for roles and - just out of the sheer physical toll on one's knees and shoulders - no-one wants to do it again. ""I think that's more or less a young man's game. I'm 57 and I don't think I'm going to take on any job - or go on any vacation again - and see to it that I can gain 30lbs."" 'Feeling fine' The actor revealed he had been diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes on US TV's Late Show with David Letterman earlier this week. He told Letterman he had been showing the symptoms for some time. ""I went to the doctor, and he said, 'You know those high blood-sugar numbers you've been dealing with since you were 36? Well, you've graduated! You've got Type 2 diabetes, young man. The actor, who won best acting Oscars for Philadelphia and Forrest Gump, added: ""It's controllable. Something's going to kill us all, Dave,"" Type 2 diabetes affects the body by either not producing enough insulin - the hormone that turns sugar into energy - or by resisting insulin. People might get diabetes because of family history, age and ethnic background. They are also more likely to get Type 2 diabetes if they are overweight. Speaking at the Captain Phillips press conference on Wednesday, Hanks said: ""Gaining and losing of weight may have had something to do with this because you eat so much bad food and you don't get any exercise when you're heavy. ""But I think I was genetically inclined to get it and I think it actually and goes back to a lifestyle I've been leading ever since I was seven years old, as opposed to 36."" The actor added his diabetes was ""part of life"" and he felt ""just fine"". In a later interview with BBC Arts Editor Will Gompertz, Hanks said: ""I always joke: you've got to maintain the temple. I get regular exercise and I eat right - which everybody should do - and I take certain meds."" He said pizza was a key ingredient when he bulked up for roles. ""Pizza is the most delightful thing ever invented and it's - for me - diabolically dangerous."" Asked about recent developments in the entertainment industry, Hanks said the advent of long-form television had ""changed the game"". ""The time you get to spend with the characters has made it possible to become truly engrossed in really great story telling at home,"" he said. ""The economics of making movies and showing them are harder than they have ever been with an audience that can see almost anything they want to any time."" Oscar buzz Hanks is receiving Oscar buzz for his role in Captain Phillips, which is based on the true story of the 2009 hijacking of the US container ship Maersk Alabama by a crew of Somali pirates. The film focuses on the relationship between the Alabama's commanding officer, Captain Richard Phillips (Hanks) and the Somali pirate captain, Muse (Barkhad Abdi), who takes him hostage. Hanks said he met the real Captain Phillips on two occasions and spent several hours with him to find out the ""little details"". The film's British director Paul Greengrass (The Bourne Supremacy, United 93) said it was a ""great honour and privilege"" to have his film opening a festival ""in a city where a lot of movies are made"".",Tom Hanks has ruled out taking on roles which require drastic weight gain following his diagnosis with Type 2 diabetes.

Despacito is still number one in the singles chart, which it has now topped for 10 non-consecutive weeks. Linkin Park's debut album Hybrid Theory is their highest-placing album at number four. It includes hit song In the End, which is the highest-charting Linkin Park entry on this week's singles chart at number 14. The band have now become the first US band in 50 years to secure three albums in the top 10. In the singles chart, Luis Fonsi's Despacito - featuring Daddy Yankee and Justin Bieber - becomes one of only five tracks to have reigned at number one on three separate occasions. Bieber's 2015 hit What Do You Mean has previously achieved this record, making him the only artist to have achieved this twice. Following closely behind the Spanglish track is DJ Khaled's Wild Thoughts, featuring Rihanna and Bryson Tiller, at number two.

"She will share custody with their cousin TJ, who was made temporary guardian last week after the 82-year-old was reported missing. She had not had contact with her grandchildren for ten days, but was later found at a spa in Arizona. A hearing on 22 August will decide if the arrangement will be made permanent. Tito Jackson Jr, the 34-year-old son of Michael's brother Tito, stepped in as guardian for Prince Michael, 15, Paris, 14 and 10 year-old Blanket. However, his lawyer Charles Shultz said he ""in no way was trying to displace his grandmother"" as ""they respect each other"". Under the new agreement, TJ Jackson remains as co-guardian, with control over the staff and day-to-day operations of the family home. Perry Sanders Jr, Katherine Jackson's lawyer, has said the arrangement will allow his client to focus on the children's upbringing and not on financial or logistics issues. The co-guardianship arrangement would also allow either adult to serve as sole guardian if the other were no longer able to serve In a sworn statement, Katherine Jackson said: ""I am, and have been, very close with my grandson TJ and have relied on him to help me raise Prince, Paris and Blanket since the death of their father. ""While I was away, I assumed that (the children) would be secure and safe in the hands of the person who had essentially been acting as an informal co-guardian on many matters with me since my appointment as guardian."" The Jackson family have been involved in legal and financial disputes since the singer's sudden death in June 2009. His will left nothing to his siblings and last week several of them signed a letter claiming it was a fake, calling on executors of the estate to resign. However Jermaine Jackson withdrew his support for the letter on Wednesday and issued a plea on Twitter for peace in the family. He wrote that the family is still raw from Michael Jackson's death, and his mother has endured incredible stress and pressures since then. No communication Katherine Jackson returned to the family compound near Los Angeles last week after publicly denying rumours she had been kidnapped by some of her adult children. She said she was unaware she had even been reported missing during her stay at the luxury spa in Tucson, Arizona last month, from where she said was unable to communicate with the outside world. Ms Jackson claims she was not allowed access to a phone or her iPad after being sent there following doctor's orders to rest, but was told that the kids were fine. Court documents revealed that she had only learned she was the subject of a search when she accidentally heard a TV report. ""While there was a telephone in my room, the telephone was not functioning and I could not dial out,"" she said in the documents. ""In addition, there was no picture on the television in my room,"" she added, and said she had repeatedly asked to have the TV fixed. ""One morning I woke up to the sound of the television,"" she said. ""While there was no picture, I heard a broadcast that stated I was missing."" 'Bunch of lies' Katherine Jackson made a statement to ABC News before she left Tucson, seated with her children Randy, Janet and Rebbie next to her, denying that she had been prevented from leaving. ""My children would never do a thing to me like that, holding me against my will,"" she said. ""It's very stupid for people to think that."" She also said she was devastated she had lost guardianship of her grandchildren ""based on a bunch of lies."" Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff said an investigator who looked into the children's care found the late singer's mother was an excellent guardian and the children love her. Michael Jackson died aged 50 from an overdose of the surgical anaesthetic propofol. His former doctor Conrad Murray was jailed for four years in November, after being convicted of the singer's involuntary manslaughter.",Michael Jackson's mother Katherine has been re-instated as guardian of his three children by a court in Los Angeles.
"Following an examination last week, Dion's doctor diagnosed a weakness in her right vocal cord and prescribed up to eight weeks of rest. ""Obviously this is the worst thing for a singer... not being able to do your shows,"" Dionwrote on her website. ""I feel worse knowing that I'm disappointing my fans. I'm so sorry... I hope they forgive me."" Dion, 43, is midway through a three-year residency at Caesars Palace, where tickets to her show sell for as much as $250 (£155). She began experiencing discomfort with her vocal cords last week but had initially anticipated returning to work at the weekend. However, a doctor in Los Angeles said Dion was suffering from inflammation of the vocal cords caused by a virus and advised her to cancel all shows until 9 June. Tickets for the cancelled performances will be refunded. Return to form ""I tried to sing at my soundcheck last week and I had no control of my voice whatsoever,"" said Dion, in a statement. ""We thought that after a few days' rest I would improve but it wasn't getting any better. I guess it was worse than I thought."" Dion continued: ""I'm fortunate that I was able to see Professor Berke. He assured me that with the amount of rest he prescribed, I would be back to 100%."" Her previous run at Caesars Palace, which began in 2003 and was eventually extended to five years, earned more than $400m (£250m).

"By Mark SavageBBC music reporter The 31-year-old, whose younger brother is Brit Award nominee John Newman, has already written for Ed Sheeran, Jess Glynne, Calvin Harris and Little Mix. He got a Brit Award and a Grammy nomination for his work on Rudimental's song Waiting All Night. On the other hand, he co-wrote Ireland's 2017 Eurovision entry, Dying To Try, and got knocked out in the semi-finals. In May, he'll head to Rotterdam as a solo artist with a mid-tempo banger called My Last Breath. It's short and direct, with the sort of ""woah-oh"" hook that would make Chris Martin envious. ""That was definitely intentional,"" says the singer, who wrote the song in January. ""We wanted to create an anthemic post-chorus that makes everyone feel involved."" ""Can you imagine 20,000 people in the arena going 'woah-oh-ohhh'? It's something you can sing along to without knowing the lyrics."" Newman's selection comes after a dismal run for the UK at Eurovision. Last year, Michael Rice's Bigger Than Us came last, scoring just 11 points. As a result, the BBC scrapped the public's role in the selection process and invited music company BMG to help it find this year's entrant. ""We started with the sole aim of changing the perception of the contest,"" said Alistair Norbury, the company's president of repertoire for the UK. That's all well and good - but the perennial argument is that Eurovision's voting system is broken, with the UK being ""punished"" for everything from the Iraq war to Brexit. Yet over the years, several academic studies have looked into political voting, and found little evidence that it affects anything beyond the mid-table results. Countries do vote for their neighbours and allies - but the winner needs pan-continental support to rise above the pack. Songs that come last tend to be boring, unconvincing or poorly-performed. So how does My Last Breath compare with the competition? Here's a quick guide to some of the contenders - with the caveat that some of Eurovision's big hitters, including Sweden and Russia, are yet to reveal their entries. Lithuania: The Roop - On Fire An early favourite with fans, On Fire is essentially a trance remix of Billie Eilish's Bad Guy, performed by Right Said Fred. It's better than that makes it sound, though, with a catchy chorus and squiggly synth line that quickly lodge in your head. The choreography is weirdly compelling, too: Singer Vaidotas Valiukevičius looks like he's been allowed to watch all the Fortnite dances once, then tried to recreate them from memory. Voters will lap it up. Can James Newman beat them? He has the better song, but The Roop are classic Eurovision crowd-pleasers. Albania: Arilena Ara - Shaj Eurovision wouldn't be Eurovision without a windswept ballad or 12, preferably sung at top volume by a woman with too much hair. On that front, Arilena Ara more than delivers. Her song is literally called ""scream"" and she belts out the high notes with all the subtlety of a klaxon in an elevator shaft. But the song's cleverly constructed around those big moments, breaking down to a quiet string section in the mid-section before ramping to the final chorus. Arilena has the experience to pull it off, too. Since winning The X Factor Albania in 2013, she's become one of the country's biggest stars, with more than 1.1 million followers on Instagram. Her single Nentori has also been a hit in Russia and Romania, which means she'll be familiar to voters there. Can James Newman beat her? No. Shaj is an early favourite amongst Eurovision-watchers, and looks set for a top five finish. Latvia: Samanta Tina - Still Breathing Samanta Tina has been chosen as Latvia's Eurovision contestant on her fifth attempt; and heads to Rotterdam with a strident hymn to female empowerment. It starts well. Tina's vocals sizzle with attitude and she seems to be building to a killer chorus. But then she deploys the ""pop drop"" - swapping out the melody for a distorted, heavily-filtered synth. It's a technique that arrived, peaked and outstayed its welcome in the space of about six months in 2015; and completely kills the momentum of this Gaga-indebted bop. Her rap in the middle-eight doesn't improve matters; and the whole enterprise eventually collapses like a soufflé that's been poked by Paul Hollywood. Can James Newman beat her? If there's any justice, yes. Australia: Montaigne - Don't Break Me Australia take Eurovision very seriously - ending up in the Top 10 four times in the last five years - and this year is no exception. Their entrant is Aria Award-winner Montaigne whose song, Don't Break Me, is a dramatically-spun story of tortured love. Driven by pounding drums and soaring chorus (""You thought I was elastic / But maybe I'm just made of glass"") the track sounds distinctly like the work of another Australian pop star, Sia. The singer's stage presence is as striking as her song. She wears Elizabethan ruffles in reference to the humanist philosopher Michel de Montaigne (after whom she's named), while her complex choreography will keep Eurovision's camera crews on their toes. Can James Newman beat her? Unlikely. France: Tom Leeb - The Best In Me France hasn't won Eurovision since 1977 and Tom Leeb's not about to change that fact. Best In Me is as grey and uninspiring as dishwater, with an insipid lyric about someone being the ""air I breathe"". It even won the disapproval of France's culture minister, Franck Riester, who criticised the song's English-language chorus for damaging the country's ""pride"". ""It broke my ears,"" he told parliament earlier this month. Can James Newman beat him? Yes, but maybe he should sing the bridge in French. Czech Republic: Benny Cristo - Kemama Professional jiu-jitsu competitor Benny Cristo has a successful sideline as a musician in the Czech Republic, scoring four number one singles and selling out Prague's O2 arena since he emerged in 2009. His entry, Kemama, is a joyous celebration of life, even in the face of prejudice. ""I don't care if they don't like me, I just came to dance,"" he sings over a funky pulse of Afrobeat. But Cristo, whose father is Angolan, admitted the song had made him the target of further abuse. ""Racism is far from over even when you try to represent the country you were born in,"" he wrote on Instagram, while announcing he intended to re-record Kemama in Kenya ""to take the song to the next level"". It could definitely do with some work. The current version just sits in the same groove for three minutes, bubbling along pleasantly without any real breakout moments. Can James Newman beat him? Both songs feel destined for the bottom half of the results table, but James's track still has the edge. Belgium: Hooverphonic - Release Me This could be the contest's dark horse. Hooverphonic are one of Belgium's biggest bands, scoring nine top 10 albums since they emerged as part of the trip-hop scene in 1995. Release Me has the sound of a vintage Bond theme, all sultry strings and descending chord sequences, as singer Luka Cruysberghs moodily pleads to be cut loose from a doomed relationship. ""It's not right to make me stay,"" she sings. ""All the lies and all the pain / Only you can make them go away."" It's almost too good for Eurovision, which probably means it's doomed. Can James Newman beat them? In a perfect world, no. At Eurovision, yes. Norway: Ulrikke Brandstorp - Attention Ulrikke Brandstorp had to fight 24 other contestants to be selected as Norway's Eurovision entry - and her progress through the competition was wrought by controversy after the voting system crashed, leaving a back-up jury to decide who made it through to the final. But the bumpy journey will stand her in good stead when it comes to Rotterdam, as will her TV experience from the Norwegian versions of Pop Idol and The Voice. Her song is another lovestruck ballad, but it takes a quiet approach - with Brandstorp conveying delicate vulnerability as her vocals flutter up the octaves. It's not as immediate as some of the other songs, but could easily pick up fans during the semi-final stages. Can James Newman beat her? Probably not - but as one of the co-writers is Christian Ingebrigtsen of the British boyband A1, we could claim it as a partial victory. Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

"It follows a documentary made by Indian-American comic Hari Kondabolu that argued the Indian character is based on racial stereotypes. Speaking on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, the actor said his ""eyes have been opened"" by the debate and that he never intended to cause offence. He also distanced himself from the show's controversial response. Shopkeeper Apu has been part of the long-running animation series since 1990, with Azaria adopting an Indian accent to voice him. The character is one of several voiced on The Simpsons by Azaria - he is also the voice of Chief Wiggum, Comic Book Guy and bartender Moe Szyslak. There has been a focus on the portrayal of Apu since Kondabolu's 2017 documentary The Problem with Apu. The director told the BBC last year that the character was problematic because he is defined by his job and how many children he has in his arranged marriage. He added Apu was one of the only representations of South Asians on US television when he was growing up and that other children imitated the character to mock him. Azaria told Colbert: ""The idea that anyone young or old, past or present, being bullied based on Apu really makes me sad. ""It certainly was not my intention. I wanted to bring joy and laughter to people."" When asked about the future of the character, Azaria said he was open to change and called for the South Asian community to be better represented in the industry. ""I've given this a lot of thought, and as I say my eyes have been opened,"" he said. ""I think the most important thing is to listen to Indian people and their experience with it. ""I really want to see Indian, South Asian writers in the writers room… including how [Apu] is voiced or not voiced. ""I'm perfectly willing and happy to step aside, or help transition it into something new. ""It not only makes sense, it just feels like the right thing to do to me."" Following the interview, Mr Kondabolu took to Twitter to thank Azaria for his words. The Simpsons' attempt to address the controversy in a recent episode sparked a mixed reception. In No Good Read Goes Unpunished, Marge is seen reading a book to daughter Lisa that has been changed from its original version to something more politically correct. ""Something that started decades ago and was applauded and inoffensive is now politically incorrect. What can you do?,"" says Lisa. The show then panned to a picture of Apu, with the slogan ""don't have a cow"". In a statement to ABC News, 20th Century Fox, the network that airs the show, said simply, ""The episode speaks for itself."" The makers have not publicly commented further, but one writer, Al Jean, has vowed to ""find an answer that is popular and, more important, right"". Discussing the episode for the first time, Azaria told Colbert he had ""nothing to do with the writing or the voicing [in that episode]"". ""I think if anyone came away from that segment thinking they need to lighten up…that's definitely not the message that I want to send.""

"The ""modern memorial"" involved about 1,500 voluntary participants appearing in public spaces across the UK. Photos and reactions to the project quickly spread across social media, connected by the #wearehere hashtag. Each carried a card with the name of the soldier they represented and his age - if known - when he died. The Battle of the Somme, one of the bloodiest of World War One, began on 1 July 1916. All of the 1,500 men represented died on the first day of fighting. More than one million men were killed and wounded on all sides during the five-month conflict, with the British suffering a total of nearly 60,000 casualties on the first day alone. The project, entitled We're Here Because We're Here, was commissioned by 14-18 NOW, the UK's arts programme for the World War One centenary. The day-long event - code-named Project Octagon - saw ""ghost Tommies"" appear at shopping centres, train stations and high streets and beaches. The Royal Exchange in Manchester, Birmingham Repertory Theatre and the National Theatres of Scotland and Wales were among 25 organisations involved. According to organisers, it ""broke new ground in terms of its scale, breadth, reach and the number of partners and participants involved"". Turner Prize winner Deller said he wanted to make ""a contemporary memorial... that moved around the UK with unpredictability"". Norris described the work as ""a truly national piece of theatre"" that offered ""a powerful way to remember the men who went off to fight 100 years ago."" The volunteers, who were drawn from a range of professions, were aged between 16 and 52, reflecting the ages of the men who would have fought in the Somme. Jenny Waldman, director of 14-18 NOW, said the project had given ""hundreds of young people across the UK the chance to find out more about... the bloodiest day in British military history."" Comedian Dawn French was among those to post a picture on Twitter, asking: ""Has anyone seen WW1 soldiers on their commute this mornin?!"" Many others have posted their own pictures of soldiers they have sighted in locations as far afield as Chester, Glasgow and Newcastle.

"She had been suffering from cancer, according to Indiana University Jacobs School of Music, where Williams became the first black professor of voice. The singer made her debut in May 1946 in the title role of Madam Butterfly with the New York City Opera. She also became a strong advocate for civil rights. ""It's impossible to overstate how important that was for the music scene in New York, for African-American singers, and for American singers,"" F Paul Driscoll, the editor-in-chief of Opera News, told the Washington Post. Williams' debut performance came nearly nine years before Marian Anderson became the first African-American singer to appear at New York's more prestigious Metropolitan Opera. A New York Times review of Williams at the time, said the singer displayed ""a vividness and subtlety unmatched by any other artist who has assayed the part here in many a year"". The following year she performed the role of Mimi in Puccini's La Boheme and in 1948 she sang the title role of Verdi's Aida. In 1951 she sang the title female role in first complete recording of Gershwin's Porgy and Bess. A lifetime member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the singer performed in her hometown of Danville, Virginia in 1963, to raise funds to free jailed civil rights demonstrators. She also sang the national anthem before 200,000 people at the 1963 civil rights march on Washington, immediately before Martin Luther King gave his famous I Have a Dream speech. In 1950, she married defence lawyer Charles Beavers, whose clients included civil rights leader Malcolm X. After Beavers' death in 1970, Williams stepped away from opera in 1971 and began teaching before eventually retiring in 1997.

"Inspired by Bowie's starring role in the 1976 cult film The Man Who Fell to Earth, he co-wrote the show with Irish playwright Enda Walsh, the award-winning writer of Once. Time Out, gave it 3/5, saying it ""lacked originality and depth."" But The Guardian described the production as ""unapologetically weird... and oddly intriguing"".

There are definitely a few surprises in store - Coldplay being at 60 for one!""",The Beatles have been declared the biggest selling singles act under the Queen's 60-year reign.
"Previous headline sets from Beyoncé, Adele, Coldplay, David Bowie and Jay-Z will be shown on BBC Two and BBC Four.

Archive performances will also be played across BBC radio stations and available on the BBC Sounds app. Organiser Emily Eavis will be interviewed by Lauren Laverne on her BBC 6 Music show on Friday 26 June. Lorna Clarke, the controller of BBC Pop said: ""Even though Worthy Farm can't be full of thousands of music lovers this year, the BBC will celebrate with four days of memories and archive footage to give our audience a taste of the festival in their own homes."" Eavis added: ""There are so many memorable sets being played across the BBC over what would have been our 50th anniversary weekend. ""Personally, I'm looking forward to a weekend of reflecting on the history of our festival and going back to some classic performances from David Bowie, Adele, REM, Beyoncé, The Rolling Stones, Jay-Z, Billie Eilish and lots more.

"Salvator Mundi, meaning Saviour of the World, dates to around 1500 and depicts a figure of Christ holding an orb. The work was long known to have existed, but had been presumed to have been lost or destroyed. The painting will be displayed as part of the gallery's Leonardo da Vinci: Painter of the Court of Milan exhibition from 9 November. The recently authenticated work was once owned by King Charles I and recorded in his art collection in 1649 before being auctioned by the son of the Duke of Buckingham in 1763. It next appeared in 1900, damaged from previous restoration attempts and its authorship unclear, when it was purchased by a British collector, Sir Frederick Cook. Cook's descendants sold it at auction in 1958 for £45 and it was acquired by a US consortium of art dealers in 2005. After undergoing extensive conservation treatment last year, it was determined to be an original Da Vinci work. It is now estimated to be worth around £120m. The last time a Da Vinci painting was discovered was in 1909, when the Benois Madonna came to light. The piece is currently on display at the Hermitage in St Petersburg.",A rediscovered oil painting by Leonardo Da Vinci is to go on show at the National Gallery in November.
"Deadline reports that Sony Pictures is broadening the franchise with the help of Ghost Corps, a production company in which original director Ivan Reitman and star Dan Aykroyd are involved. ""We want to expand the Ghostbusters universe,"" said Reitman. It is hoped the new film will be shot next year and released in 2017. ""It's just the beginning of what I hope will be a lot of wonderful movies,"" Reitman is quoted as saying. After lying dormant for many years, the Ghostbusters franchise is back on track thanks to the first new film in which Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarthy will star. Saturday Night Live comediennes Leslie Jones and Kate McKinnon will join them in the sequel, which will go before the cameras in June and arrive in cinemas in July 2016. Director Paul Feig, said Reitman, has ""got four of the funniest women in the world and there will be other surprises to come"". The second film, he continued, ""has a wonderful idea that builds on that."" Drew Pearce, writer of Iron Man 3 and the upcoming fifth Mission: Impossible film, is attached to write the film, while Joe and Anthony Russo, the sibling duo behind the second and third Captain America films, are being wooed to direct. ""The hope is to be ready for the Russo Brothers' next window next summer to shoot, with the movie coming out the following year,"" said Reitman. The involvement of Tatum's Free Association production company has prompted speculation that the Magic Mike and 21 Jump Street actor is being lined up to star. According to Reitman, Ghost Corps has been set up to explore the potential for ""films, TV shows, merchandise - all things that are part of modern filmed entertainment"".","Actor Channing Tatum is being mooted as a potential star of a new Ghostbusters film that will follow the female-led ""reboot"" set for release next year."
"By Tim MastersEntertainment and arts correspondent, BBC News The Tate's annual report reveals that almost eight million people visited the art museum's four galleries in 2012-13. Tate chairman Lord Browne said that figure was ""more than any other art museum in the world, except for The Louvre"". The Hirst retrospective at Tate Modern in 2012 was the most popular solo exhibition in Tate history. Tate Modern has also unveiled a new digital project - entitled Bloomberg Connects - with 75 screens mounted on walls throughout the former power station which display visitors' ideas and comments. In addition, a ""digital drawing bar"" allows people to draw on touch screens and see their creations projected instantly for other visitors to see. Tate Modern's creative director Jane Burton admitted that the public's drawings would not be pre-vetted but ""there will be a system to take down inappropriate things should they emerge, and no doubt that will occasionally happen"". Tate director Sir Nicholas Serota said: ""In the coming years we need to devote as much attention to the digital as we have given recently to the physical expansion and improvement of our buildings."" The annual report, published on Thursday, showed that 7.74 million people visited the four galleries - Tate Britain, Tate Modern, Tate Liverpool and Tate St Ives - in 2012-13 making it Tate's most successful year to date. Last year's figure was 7.06m. More people visited Tate Modern than ever before - 5.5 million. It retained its position as the most visited gallery of modern and contemporary art in the world and was the second most popular tourist attraction in the UK, after the British Museum. The Damien Hirst exhibition attracted more than 463,000 visitors. Tate Britain's Pre-Raphaelites show brought in 240,000 visitors. Tate lent record numbers of works to venues in the UK as well as abroad. Some 1,762 works were lent to 1,181 venues in the UK and 581 internationally. A total of 502 works were acquired solely by Tate with a total value of over £23m. Long-term funding Unveiling the annual report on Thursday, Tate bosses also called for a ""clear contractual arrangement"" with government to help unlock sources of long-term funding, such as philanthropic giving. A significant proportion of Tate's funding is made up of grant-in-aid from the government. In 2012-13 this was £34.9m of the Tate's £157.8m income. Tate chair Lord Browne said government funding for the arts had ""failed to keep pace with inflation"". He said: ""Our ability to rely on public funds is only going to decrease which means that the link between our grant and the public services we provide will need to be redefined."" Sir Nicholas told the BBC: ""Museums work in the long term rather than over a two or three year cycle - so we have to plan. We're looking to government to think in the longer term, we need to think about where museums want to be in 2020-2025."" He added that he was ""reasonably optimistic that some of the corporate money that has disappeared in recent years will gradually come back to us"". The Tate's 2014 programme includes major exhibitions from: Henri Matisse, Piet Mondrian, JMW Turner, and 100 Years Later: Conflict, Time, Photography - a photographic exhibition timed to coincide with the centenary of the First World War.","Record numbers of visitors flocked to the Tate last year, driven in part by the popularity of artist Damien Hirst."
"The first episode aired earlier this month but the rest of the series has now been cancelled. The participant was accused of having Nazi symbols on his face, but he denies they have any such meanings. Sky History apologised and said it was ""thoroughly reviewing"" its processes. A statement said AETN UK, which runs the channel, had ""made the decision not to broadcast any further episodes of The Chop on Sky History"" following an ""independent investigation"". It said: ""A contestant's tattoos included symbols that could be connected to far-right ideologies and could cause offence; we sincerely apologise for that and we are sorry that our processes did not prompt further investigation at an earlier stage. ""The contestant continues to strenuously deny that he has, or ever had, far-right leanings. We are thoroughly reviewing our internal processes following the investigation. AETN UK and Sky History stand against racism and hate speech of all kinds."" The Chop: Britain's Top Woodworker, hosted by Lee Mack and Rick Edwards, was due to have followed 10 contestants as they competed over nine weeks of carpentry challenges. But concerns were first raised when the channel posted a clip on social media last week. Darren Lumsden, from North Somerset, was seen with the number 88 on his cheek. As H is the eighth letter of the alphabet, the number can be used by white supremacists as numerical code for ""Heil Hitler"". Viewers also pointed out other markings that could be associated with white supremacist slogans. Sky History initially said his tattoos denoted ""significant events in his life and have no political or ideological meaning whatsoever"". It said the number 88 referred to 1988, the year of Mr Lumsden's father's death. However, Lumsden's father is still alive, according to The Sun and The Daily Mail, who both claimed to have tracked him down. In its initial statement, the channel said producers had carried out ""extensive background checks"" on all contestants and ""confirmed Darren has no affiliations or links to racist groups, views or comments"". However, that statement was deleted and a separate announcement said the channel would investigate the tattoos' ""nature, and meaning"". The BBC has approached Mr Lumsden for comment. Speaking to the Bristol Post about his tattoos in an article published before the furore erupted, he said: ""I have my daughter on the back of my head and my son on my cheek. ""When some people first meet me they are a bit shocked, admittedly. But they soon warm to me after a few minutes."" Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

"By Mark SavageMusic reporter Last week's ceremony was criticised for failing to recognise urban music, particularly grime, with the hashtag #BritsSoWhite trending on social media. ""There was an elephant in the room last Wednesday,"" wrote Doherty in an open letter to the Guardian. He promised to review the 1,100-strong voting academy who decide nominees, so it ""can be more truly representative"". Doherty said he ""suspected"" the current members of the voting academy were ""largely white and with a bias towards older men"". ""This does not mean that there is an underlying prejudice at play, but the unintended consequence is that emerging genres of music may not be properly recognised."" His aim, he continued, was to achieve at least 15% BAME [black and minority ethnic] participation in the the voting academy, in line with national population figures, ""as well as being more diverse with regard to age and regionality, so that it can be more truly representative of modern British music."" Several artists protested about the lack of recognition for Britain's urban music scene ahead of this year's ceremony. BAME artists failed to secure nominations in any of the main categories, and all the awards eventually went to white acts. Singer Laura Mvula said she would not attend the show because of ""the diversity issue"", adding that black children grew up feeling they were ""not acknowledged in society, in media and in mainstream music"". London MC Stormzy then released a song, One Take Freestyle, protesting over the exclusion of grime scene artists from wider recognition. ""I felt very disappointed, I wasn't angry,"" he told BBC Radio 1. ""It was such a great year for grime and underground music... I thought maybe this year it might get celebrated."" Doherty said he had met with Stormzy following his comments, and was looking at how metrics other than Top 40 success - such as engagement on social media - could be used to shortlist nominees.","Next year's Brit Awards will represent a more diverse range of music, Brits chairman Ged Doherty has said."
"The Marvel release extended its run at the top of the movie chart, taking $16.3m (£9.8m) across the country's Labor Day holiday weekend. It has now taken a total of $275m (£165m) so far. Captain America is the second biggest film of 2014 to date, followed by the Lego Movie. Transformers is at number four on the annual list. Over the bank holiday weekend, Guardians kept Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in second spot, with If I Stay remaining at three with takings of $9.3m (£5.5m). Pierce Brosnan action flick The November Man entered at six. The release took a modest $7.7m (£4.6m) and was outperformed by thriller As Above, So Below, which made its debut at number four. Comedy Let's Be Cops was fifth. Guardians of the Galaxy entered the chart at number one at the beginning of August, before temporarily losing its crown to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. The space adventure stars Zoe Saldana and Chris Pratt, and also features the voices of Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel. A sequel to the Marvel Comics adaptation is expected to be released in 2017. Despite the film's success, the summer box office in North America is down on last year. Paul Dergarabedian, box office analyst at Rentrak, said: ""This summer was placed in the unfortunate position of being the follow-up to the biggest revenue generating summer of all time."" He went on to call last year the ""perfect storm"", featuring very strong performers including Iron Man and Star Trek. ""One or two movies can make all the difference,"" added Mr Dergarabedian.","Sci-fi blockbuster Guardians of the Galaxy has stamped its authority on the US box office, becoming the biggest film of the year so far."
"But it has been confirmed by the show's production company that this is actually the case. Mammoth Screen defended the decision, saying Turner had ""significantly more screen time than any other character"". A representative for Tomlinson told the BBC that she wishes to make no further comment. The question of whether there was a pay gap on Poldark, which is shown on BBC One, came up during Tomlinson's interview with Red Magazine. Asked whether she thought she was paid the same as her co-star, she said ""my guess is no"". Tomlinson, who plays Ross Poldark's wife Demelza on the show, added that she thought this was unfair. ""While at the beginning that might have been OK, he was a bigger star than me, now I don't think so"". ""We're equal leads of the show, so I'd be pretty upset if the gap hadn't closed."" A spokeswoman for Mammoth Screen said: ""Whilst we can't and won't disclose the details, we do pay Aidan Turner more for playing Ross Poldark as throughout all series Ross has significantly more screen time than any other character."" Representatives for Tomlinson said in response: ""There will not be any further comment."" This is not the first time that equal pay has been raised an issue within the entertainment industry.

"By Annabel RackhamEntertainment reporter Victoria Beckham, Geri Horner, Emma Bunton, Melanie Brown, Melanie Chisholm (and former manager Simon Fuller) were pictured together on Friday. The last time they were all together was in 2012, when they performed at the London Olympics and then went on tour. Victoria ruled out singing again last year and Emma said they needed ""another sit down"" before the plans took shape. Speaking on Heart London on Monday, Emma wouldn't confirm whether there would be a tour or new album. She cryptically said there was a need for ""a bit of girl power in the world"". This was echoed by Mel C, who spoke to Dermot O'Leary on the Radio 2 Saturday Breakfast Show saying ""opportunities and ideas"" were being discussed but ""nothing set in stone"". The Sun has reported that the band members could be in line for £10m each and are considering TV shows, endorsement deals and a compilation album. Seeing as they haven't confirmed what reuniting actually involves, we've put together 10 possible options. DISCLAIMER: None of these are real, but we fully expect a sizeable payout if they ever materialise. 1. Cooking show Geri often takes to Instagram to show what she's been baking, as shown in the video above - which means she and the girls could easily host their own cooking show. Obviously to be called Spice Up Your Life. The quintet could host a show with a Ready, Steady, Cook twist, where they pick spices and contestants have to incorporate them into meals - really anything is possible with this one. 2. Entertainment show Keeping the theme of new TV ventures going, what better way to reprise old rivalries than with an entertainment show where the girls face off against other 90's girlbands? Imagine the set up of giant inflatables from Total Wipeout, with band members from Atomic Kitten, Eternal, All Saints and the Sugababes chucked in for your entertainment.... I can sense the Bafta nomination already. 3. Taxi company Who can forget those feelings of national pride and nostalgia when The Spice Girls arrived on stage at the London 2012 Olympics, reprising their role as the best girl band ever (sorry Little Mix). The sight of them on the top of cabs could be a taste of what's to come - the Spice Girls launching their own taxi company. Travel would definitely be more fun if it involved singing Say You'll Be There in a pair of knee high silver boots with glittery hair to match. 4. Make-up range One thing that was consistent during the Spice reign of the 1990s was that the girls were always on brand. Posh, Ginger, Scary, Baby and Sporty Spice always had perfect outfits to match and of course make-up too. They could take a leaf out of Nicola Roberts from Girls Aloud's book and bring out a cosmetics line with a collection to suit each of their styles. Think leopard print colours for Mel B, soft pinks for Emma and waterproof for Mel C. 5. Contraception The girls already addressed the importance of staying safe during sex in their song 2 Become 1, so maybe they could go one step further and release their own range of condoms. X Factor's JLS may have done it back in 2010, but there hasn't been a celebrity endorsed brand in a while and the market is crying out for a Spice Girls-endorsed collection. 6. Fitness DVD No Spice Girls performance was ever without an athletic, perfectly choreographed dance routine and watching them perform live was exhausting in itself. What better way to make a bit of money than recreating the iconic moves for a new workout DVD? The January rush may have passed, but it's never too late to Wannabe fit right? 7. Language app This may be a slightly tenuous link but the song Viva Forever has one line of Spanish in it and we all know Geri can speak the language after she released her hit song Mi Chico Latino in 1999. Why not capitalise on this with a language learning app? Being taught how to say ""If you wannabe my lover, you gotta get with my friends"" is definitely an important life skill. 8. Mama and baby range Mama pulled on our heartstrings when it was released in 1996 as a dedication to the girls' mums, thanking them for being their best friends. Now that all the girls are parents themselves, it would be a great opportunity for them to release a mum and baby range, complete with matching Spice themed outfits, Spice slogan baby grows and t-shirts and even some Spice dolls to play with too. 9. Fragrance It's been done by everyone from Beyonce to Britney, Shakira to Nicki Minaj. Fragrance deals are big business and should definitely be on the girls' radars as part of their comeback. They did bring out a body spray back in 1997 and David Beckham has his own aftershave, so could definitely give the girls a helping hand in putting together the perfect scent. 10. Grime compilation album The girls have apparently been toying with the idea of re-releasing some old albums as part of a compilation. Perhaps they could put a new twist on it by collaborating with some grime artists? Giggs having a verse on Stop, Stormzy on Viva Forever and Skepta on Who Do You Think You Are would definitely bring their hits into the 21st Century and if it worked for Little Mix then it could definitely work for the girls.

""When I arrived at the airport the sniffer dogs made a bee-line for me,"" she recalled on the BBC One show. Berry described the experience as ""alarming"". ""Suddenly I was surrounded by uniformed people and my assistant and I were put in separate cells,"" she added. ""When I was asked if I was going to make money from the stuff, I said, 'I do and my fee has already been agreed.'"" She explained she had ""thought there might be problems"" so weighed the ingredients in advance and put them in the ""little plastic bags"" - not expecting they might be mistaken for illicit substances. Berry was appearing on the show with Claudia Winkleman to talk about their new BBC series, Britain's Best Home Cook. Winkleman joked that the airport incident revealed Berry's ""darker side"".

""I'm absolutely devastated that I'm unable to continue in the competition,"" the 30-year-old said. ""I was so excited to hit the dance floor."" At the weekend, he was seen on crutches and with a protective boot on his foot. No details have been released about whether he will be replaced in the line-up.

"By Helen BushbyBBC News Ruth Mackenzie said the event, which is part of the London 2012 Festival - will put ""culture back up there with sport"" during next year's Games in London. It will include thousands of performers in 70 productions, with global artists acting in their own languages. The British Museum will host a show on London during Shakespeare's time. Festival director Deborah Shaw said at the launch of the festival, which is being produced by the Royal Shakespeare Company, that it would ""redefine what's possible in creating a festival in a global age"". The festival shows will include Jonathan Pryce as King Lear in a production directed by Michael Attenborough and Meera Syal playing Beatrice in Much Ado About Nothing, set in India. There will also be two performances in Arabic - a Tunisian company will do a version of Macbeth while the Iraqi Theatre Company will perform Romeo and Juliet in Baghdad. More than 50 arts organisations will take part in the festival, which is being supported by BP and the National Lottery. British Museum director Neil MacGregor said its exhibition would ""let us get into the heads of people in the theatres"" during Shakespeare's time. ""Four hundred years ago people went to the playhouse to learn about the world,"" he said. ""The British Museum will present a unique take on the way in which Shakespeare staged the world for an increasingly diverse audience in the 17th century, at a pivotal point in our history."" Thousands of worldwide performers, both amateur and professional, are involved in the festival. Shows, including those specially commissioned, will take place both in London and across the UK. The RSC has collaborated in the UK with venues including the Globe, the Almeida Theatre, the Barbican, the British Museum, National Theatre, National Theatre Wales, the Roundhouse and Sage Gateshead. Some of the productions will also be online. The Globe, on the banks of the London's River Thames, has already announced that it will present all of Shakespeare's plays, staging one production itself with the remaining 36 plays each performed in a different language by a different company from around the world. The aim will be to celebrate ""the vast array of ethnic communities and languages that make up London's vibrant multi-cultural landscape"". Its artistic director Dominic Dromgoole said: ""Shakespeare is the language which brings us together better than any other"". However there was some disagreement over whether the use of surtitles translating languages during performances not in English was a good idea. Surtitles are translated or transcribed dialogue or lyrics projected above a stage or displayed on a screen for the audience. Dromgoole described them as an ""incessant distraction"" and said they would be used during the Globe performances only to describe the action of the scene. They would not translate the words being spoken. But Warner and MacKenzie both said other performances would use full surtitles, with MacKenzie adding that audiences should not be ""underestimated"" and Warner saying surtitles were ""not a distraction"". More than 260 amateur groups, with 7,200 performers aged from six to 90, will perform their own interpretations of Shakespeare everywhere from castles, parks and village halls to pubs, churches and a coffin works. The festival also has an educational element, with the BBC exploring Shakespeare's role as ""chronicler of our national history and identity"". Shakespeare Unlocked is a digital project featuring film excerpts of performances and workshops, with emphasis on 11 to 18-year-olds. It is part of a project between BBC Learning and RSC Education. BBC Television will also feature Off By Heart Shakespeare, a verse-speaking contest culminating in a final filmed in the RSC. Michael Boyd, artistic director of the RSC, said it was the most ""outrageously collaborative of festivals"", adding it was important to ""step outside the familiar"" and seeing Shakespeare performed by global artists would allow audiences to do this. Mayor of London Boris Johnson added: ""William Shakespeare is our greatest cultural export, and is quite rightly considered to be the finest writer of all time. ""This festival is a fantastic opportunity for these fine works to be brought to a new generation of schoolchildren, while at the same time reminding existing fans of Shakespeare's unparalleled insights into the workings of the human heart."" The festival will run from 23 April to 9 September next year with more than a million tickets going on sale from 10 October.","The World Shakespeare Festival is the ""trump card"" putting ""art at the heart of the Olympics"", the head of the Cultural Olympiad has said."
"Emmelie de Forest, 20, had been the overwhelming favourite among the 26 entries, with her song Only Teardrops. Azerbaijan finished second. The UK's Bonnie Tyler came 19th, an improvement on last year when Engelbert Humperdinck came second from last. There was disappointment for Ireland's Ryan Dolan as he finished in last place with just five points. De Forest won with 281 points and Azerbaijan's Farid Mammadov finished 47 points behind, followed by Ukraine in third and Norway in fourth. Denmark, which will now have the job of hosting the 59th contest next year, had previously won in 1963 and 2000. 'It's amazing' De Forest sang her up-tempo tune barefoot, saying before she performed: ""It makes me feel closer to the ground, the earth and makes me feel more relaxed."" At the post-event news conference, she told reporters: ""It has been quite stressful but it's also a wonderful thing that has happened to me. It's amazing. ""It was crazy when they put the butterfly [of the winning country's flag] on the dress. I didn't understand we had won at that point."" She added: ""Of course I believed in the song, but that's the exciting thing about Eurovision you don't know what's going to happen. So I was surprised and shocked when it happened."" TV viewers across Europe were treated to the mix of high-energy pop and power ballads that have become synonymous with the contest, as well as some outlandish stage performances. One of the more eccentric acts was Romania's Cezar, who mixed his operatic voice with a disco beat. He managed a respectable 13th position. 'Ready to party' UK entrant Tyler, 61, who is best known for her 1983 hit Total Eclipse of the Heart, had high hopes for her chances. But the Welsh singer scored just 23 points for her performance of Believe In Me. Speaking afterwards, Tyler said that despite her final score the experience had been ""a night to remember"". She said: ""I got the feeling tonight that I got at the Grammy awards. ""I'm sure a lot of people will be disappointed on my behalf but I have really enjoyed my Eurovision experience. ""I did the best that I could do with a great song. I don't feel down and I'm ready to party."" Johnny Logan, the three-time Eurovision winner who represented Ireland, said the UK's entries had not been strong enough in recent years. ""I think over the years it's been slated so much in England and Ireland that the best writers don't take part in it any more. That's the reality,"" he said.","Denmark has triumphed at this year's Eurovision Song Contest, held in the Swedish city of Malmo."

"The finalists come from nine different countries and include a Swiss writer for the first time. The judging panel is chaired by literary critic Sir Christopher Ricks and features Elif Batuman, Aminatta Forna, Yiyun Li and Tim Parks. Now in its fifth year, the Man Booker International recognises one writer for their achievement in fiction. The award differs from the Man Booker Prize in that it recognises the author's continued creativity, development and overall contribution to literature, rather than a single work. The 10 nominees are: U.R. Ananthamurthy (India), Aharon Appelfeld (Israel), Lydia Davis (USA), Intizar Husain (Pakistan),Yan Lianke (China), Marie NDiaye (France), Josip Novakovich (Canada), Marilynne Robinson (USA), Vladimir Sorokin (Russia) and Peter Stamm (Switzerland). Robinson is the only one to have been a previous finalist, in 2011, while Marie NDiaye, at 45, is the youngest author ever to be a Man Booker International nominee. Yan Lianke and Vladimir Sorokin have both had books banned in their home countries. Sir Christopher said of the finalists: ""Each is the author of a substantial body of published work, whether novels or short stories, either written in or translated into English. ""Some of these men and women are in their eighties, the youngest in their forties and fifties. They write in ways that are astonishingly different."" The winner will be announced at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London on 22 May.","The shortlist of 10 authors competing for the £60,000 Man Booker International Prize has been announced."

"The Wireless Festival and Hard Rock Calling - which were previously held in London's Hyde Park - are the first events confirmed for the venue. The move ends a 10-year link the concert promoter had with The Royal Parks. Live Nation previously had complaints from residents about noise levels at events it has hosted in the park. Last July, fans at Hard Rock Calling were left bemused when Bruce Springsteen and Sir Paul McCartney's microphones were switched off during a duet after a concert over-ran. According to Westminster Council, Live Nation took the decision to end the concert ""to comply with their licence"". It is believed the concert promoter pulled out of bidding for a new contract with the Royal Parks Agency (RPA) in a dispute over the tendering process. It had been reported Live Nation branded the process ""flawed"" saying the RPA did not recognise the complex logistics and costs associated with running big events. In November, rival promoter AEG Live was eventually awarded a new five-year contract to stage concerts at the park. The RPA said the company would provide entertainment while minimising the impact on the local community. Live Nation was awarded the Olympic Park contract by the London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC), which is responsible for future use of the Olympic Park and its venues. ""The confidence now shown by one of the world's leading live entertainment promoters to relocate two of its biggest music festivals from the centre of the capital is a ringing endorsement of our legacy plans,"" Mayor of London and LLDC chairman, Boris Johnson, said. ""Along with the other major international sports events we have already secured this latest news proves that the park has a very bright future indeed."" Both Wireless and Hard Rock Calling will be held in July in the North Park. Live Nation said it plans to announce ""some major concerts with world-renowned artists"" over the coming weeks.",Live Nation is to host a series of concerts and festivals at the Olympic Park and Stadium this summer.
"The movie, which originally starred Julia Roberts, Kevin Bacon and Kiefer Sutherland, follows a group of medical students who create near-death experiences which put their lives in jeopardy.

Neils Arden Oplev, who was behind the original Girl With The Dragon Tattoo film, is set to direct the film about medical students experimenting with ""near death"" experiences. The reboot joins the trend of several cult movies set to be remade, including Jumanji, Point Break and The Birds.

"By Tim MastersArts and Entertainment correspondent Coming Home featured conversations with British troops returning from Afghanistan alongside ""innovative"" new poems by Sir Andrew. It was broadcast on Radio 4 last November to mark Remembrance Day. The £5,000 prize is funded from the honorarium the current laureate, Carol Ann Duffy, receives from the Queen. Sir Andrew visited a British army base in Germany where he interviewed a number of soldiers and their families. He used those conversations as the basis for the radio programme and a series of new poems reflecting on the effect of conflict. In an interview with the BBC last year about Coming Home, Sir Andrew said: ""The first poetry book I ever bought was one by Wilfred Owen. But however great those poems are, there's a sense that you're hearing the men speak through their officers and I wanted to do something more direct."" One of the Ted Hughes award judges, Julia Copus, said the resulting radio piece was a ""deserving winner"". ""We loved the way in which the listener is invited into the writing process: first we eavesdrop on conversations with the soldiers, and then we witness the poems hatching from those conversations. ""The author has gone to some lengths to absent himself from the lines, and claims to have changed very little to produce what he calls 'a rapid fire kind of poetry', but don't be fooled: Motion's skilful shaping and alterations have resulted in a subtle and magical transformation."" Roger McGough, the president of the Poetry Society and presenter of R4's Poetry Please, told the BBC: ""Poetry fits very well on radio, it's the place for it."" Also on this year's Ted Hughes shortlist were Patience Agbabi, Imtiaz Dharker, Carrie Etter and Alice Oswald. Sir Andrew was poet laureate from 1999 to 2009. He was knighted for his services to poetry in 2009. One Tourniquet From Coming Home by Andrew Motion It was a long time ago but I was there, a combat medical technician. I saw children and IEDs which wasn't nice at all. One boy: he had shorts and a dirty vest, he stood on a mine; he was conscious at first, screaming, and I thought what a mess. All in bit of field. None of the other kids cried, they're quite sort of tough. Very tough kids in fact. Definitely. At the time we were only issued one tourniquet each. Camp Phoenix was down the road and he went there. A double amputee. But we heard later he survived. So yeah, brilliant. Everything is hard. Everything they've got to do, everywhere they've got to go. Just hard. I used to imagine little towns in the country nobody knew. Little towns nobody had touched. There would be people living there all the same. Just living there in the vastness. Also announced on Thursday was the winner of the National Poetry Competition - the world's biggest international open poetry competition for single poems. Roger Philip Dennis's poem Corkscrew Hill Photo was chosen from 13,000 poems to win the £5,000 prize. Judge Roddy Lumsden called it a ""stunning poem which mixes sweetness, sentiment, the visual and a touch of the grotesque"". Corkscrew Hill Photo by Roger Philip Dennis All afternoon she counts the sounds until the fly-specked room crackles with silence. Even the song thrush noteless. A thick drizzle trickles rivulets down the window pane, smears distance on fields, curtains-off hills and greens the sagged thatch, aches in the creaking gate and screws watering eye to misting glass: a hearse skids slowly up the muddy lane, blurs in droplets on a spider-web, spins sideways into darkness... Dennis, an artist who runs painting workshops from his studio in Devon, was inspired to write the poem many years after taking a landscape photograph in the early 1980s. He is the 37th person to win the Poetry Society's National Poetry Competition since it began in 1978. Previous winners include Helen Dunmore, Ruth Padel, Philip Gross, Carol Ann Duffy, Jo Shapcott and Tony Harrison. This year's competition, which is judged anonymously, attracted a record number of entries from 84 countries. ""I didn't know there were 84 countries!"" McGough told the BBC. ""So many people have been helped by winning this. It also encourages other people. ""Poetry's important. If you don't have competitions it's very easy for poetry to get lost.""",A radio programme by former poet laureate Andrew Motion exploring the impact of war has won the Ted Hughes Award for New Work in Poetry.
"By Ian YoungsArts reporter, BBC News Konstantin Novoselov, who won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2010, took tiny samples of pencil graphite from the drawings and turned them into graphene. Parker will use the graphene in the venue's reopening events in October. The Whitworth is being extended in a £15m redevelopment. Novoselov won the Nobel Prize with Andre Geim for their groundbreaking work on graphene, the thinnest, strongest known material, at the University of Manchester. He worked with a conservator from the gallery to take ""microscopic"" samples from drawings from the Whitworth collection. They also used a drawing by William Blake and a letter written by nuclear physics pioneer Sir Ernest Rutherford. The resulting graphene will be used to build an electronic sensor that is triggered by humidity. On the Whitworth's reopening night on 25 October, Novoselov will breathe into the sensor, triggering a firework display designed by Parker to look like a meteor shower, inspired by William Blake's painting The Ancient of Days. The redeveloped gallery will also host Parker's largest solo exhibition to date. It will include her 1991 installation Cold Dark Matter; An Exploded View, which was ranked in the top 10 in a survey to find the most popular British artworks last year. The 19th Century Whitworth gallery has been closed for redevelopment since last summer. By October, it will have a new extension and a sculpture garden that will double its public space. Other artists whose work will feature in the relaunch exhibitions from 25 October will include Chinese-born Cai Guo-Qiang, Turner Prize winner Laure Prouvost, photographer Johnnie Shand Kydd and German artist Thomas Schutte. Whitworth director Maria Balshaw said: ""The opening programme, led by Cornelia Parker's remarkable exhibition, captures the spirit of the Whitworth - a place where marvellous, eclectic art works connect to people and our place in Manchester.""","Artist Cornelia Parker has teamed up with a Nobel Prize-winning scientist to turn fragments of drawings by Picasso, Constable and Turner into a new artwork for Manchester's Whitworth gallery."
"Litchfield played the miserable Tommy in the pub-based BBC comedy Early Doors, which aired in 2003 and 2004. Phil Mealey, who wrote the show with Craig Cash, confirmed the news to the BBC, saying the performer had been in poor health for several years. ""He was a fantastic actor,"" and nothing like Tommy, Mealey said. ""He was quite a miserable old bugger in the pub, but he was nothing like that in real life. He was always winding people up and messing around. He was a good old guy."" Mealey and Cash went through a lengthy audition process and saw some big names for the part of Tommy, but gave it to Litchfield ""because he was just so great at that character"", the writer added. Litchfield, from Wigan, then moved into Coronation Street as Wilf Morton, a former criminal who faked his own death. His other TV roles included Wild Bill in Phoenix Nights plus credits in Sunshine, My Family, Stay Lucky and Vacuuming Completely Nude in Paradise. Early Doors co-star Christine Bottomley paid tribute to ""our dear friend"". Phoenix Nights actors Paddy McGuinness and Justin Moorhouse also sent tributes on Twitter. And Michael Starke, who played the son of Litchfield's character in Coronation Street, described him as a ""lovely man and fine actor"". Litchfield often played cantankerous characters on screen, but once said: ""I'm nothing like the man I play in films and on TV. ""But people who see me around Wigan must think I'm a real miserable old chap because that's the side of me they see on the television.

"By Tim MastersArts and entertainment correspondent, BBC News Within seconds of arriving for our interview, Peter Firmin produces a saggy, old cloth cat from a box and plonks him on the table with a soft thump. ""He's not fragile, he's a tough old cat, but he's still a bit floppy and loose at the seams."" This is the original Bagpuss puppet from the children's TV series Firmin co-created with the late Oliver Postgate in 1974. ""It's his 40th birthday this year,"" says Firmin. ""He came into my head as a marmalade cat, but it was a mistake in the dyeing process that he turned out to be pink - which is the best thing that ever happened."" Next to Bagpuss, Firmin places one of the Clangers - the pink knitted aliens from the late 1960s who have never been forgotten by the generation who grew up with them. When the robot probe Philae landed on Comet 67P last week social media was abuzz with jokes about it sending back a photograph of the Clangers - who eke out a threadbare existence in burrows on a small cratered planet in outer space. ""I'm surprised that after all these years people still remember us with affection,"" says Firmin, 85, who on Sunday will pick up a special award at the Children's Baftas, recognising his outstanding contribution to children's media and the entertainment industry. The award will be presented by Bernard Cribbins, with an introduction by Michael Palin, who narrates a new version of The Clangers due to air on CBeebies in 2015. Postgate's son Daniel is writing the scripts for the new version, with Firmin as an executive producer. Like the original series - which also featured characters such as the Soup Dragon and the Froglets - the new episodes are being made as stop-motion films with real puppets. ""I've seen them and held them. They are very similar to the original ones,"" says Firmin, adding that the 21st Century Clangers will have the ability to ""leap about"". ""People will see it as a modern version of the same thing. We insisted on no computer generated images. They've got a team of ladies knitting the puppets. I've seen rushes, and they are brilliant, and everyone loves them."" Firmin admits he's not a huge fan of computer generated animation. ""I don't like CGI very much because it's a bit dead. When you see some of these computer generated humans you look into their eyes and you think there's no soul there."" Firmin and Postgate's working partnership lasted some 30 years. Postgate, who died in 2008, ran the company Smallfilms with early output that included Ivor the Engine and Pogles' Wood. Firmin made the puppets and sets, while Postgate wrote the scripts and did the animation. Most of their films were made in barns on Firmin's farm in Blean, near Canterbury in Kent, where he still works as an engraver and printmaker. ""For us it was a little cottage industry,"" Firmin says. ""We worked together very well and although we had our differences from time to time it was because Oliver saw things different to me because he was left-handed and I was right-handed."" He compares himself and Postgate to another of their early animations. ""Oliver was Noggin the Nog - the polite and gentle king of the northlands. I was Thor Nogson - his not very fierce captain of the guard, always one step behind and a bit grumpy."" With The Clangers set to return to the small screen, how much would Firmin like to see Bagpuss resurrected for a modern audience? ""We're pretty definite that we don't want anyone to remake Bagpuss. Those 13 films are part of many people's childhood. I think we would be very unhappy with someone trying to remake them, because there would be something missing. ""Dan Postgate had an idea that they could be remade in a New England setting for the American market. But I don't really want to think about that. ""I can't imagine Bagpuss being anything but an Edwardian cat."" The Bafta Children's awards take place on Sunday 23 November at London's Roundhouse.","As animator Peter Firmin prepares to receive a special Bafta honour, he reveals how the new Clangers TV series is shaping up and explains why he never wants to remake Bagpuss."

"By Kev GeogheganMusic reporter Okay, we understand the idea of travelling the globe and playing music to thousands of gibbering clubbers may not seem like work to most punters but the income tax man would beg to differ. Anyway, we tracked Steve down on his uber-short vacation ahead of the Grammys where a Netflix film about his hectic lifestyle called I'll Sleep When I'm Dead was nominated in the documentary category. Steve also recently collaborated with One Directioner Louis Tomlinson on the track Just Hold On. Steve, we're speaking to you in Aspen, Colorado, how is it going? It's beautiful, I have a view of the mountains and the trees, it's really nice. Are you a country person at heart then or are you a city boy? I'm a city boy that romanticises being away from the city. 300 shows a year and just four days off, is that all it takes to recharge the batteries? I've got to take a break sometime, so I'm spending the days snowboarding and enjoying myself with my friends, I do that once a year and this is my four days off. I try to enjoy doing my hobbies. You get into a cycle and it becomes awkward when I'm not in the studio or touring and playing shows, I get fidgety, I have to get back into the grind. I'm lucky because I love what I do. Where are you at your most creative? That's an interesting thing because before, I would have to find it in a a particular location but I've realised that my inspiration is everywhere I go and I need to be able to harness that and sometimes those moments of creativity are fleeting and you have to try and capture it when it comes. Luckily I get to travel the world and meet amazing creative people and you just have to be in the now and soak it in. You spend most of the year travelling, what are your must-have travel items? Just so I can survive, because I don't have a regular sleep pattern, in order to sleep in a car or a plane, I have my eye-mask, my specific eye-mask, I have this obnoxious pillow I travel with and my headphones. The most important bit about the eye mask is that it doesn't touch my eyes so it looks like a bra for a doll, it's bulging, I should paint some eyeballs on it. I put it on and it's blacked out. I got my hood up, headphones on, if I'm travelling through Japan or China, I have a face-mask, you can't tell who I am. You're working with the Migos, who were described by Donald Glover as 'this generation's Beatles', what did he mean and do you agree? I've know these guys for a long time, they played a show in Atlanta, we went into the studio and knocked out a song real quick. These guys are amazing, without writing anything down they get an idea and start vibing it out and just nail it in one go. The thing about music is that you look at The Beatles and throughout history there are very few groups that define a sound and generation. That song Bad and Boujee is definitive of this time in America, of American culture, so I agree with Donald that they represent culture in a really massive way. You had a new punk-influenced fashion collection showcased during New York fashion week, is this about scaling up 'Steve Aoki' the brand? I've been involved in fashion in one form or another for a long time, when I was 15 I was screen-printing shirts in my mum's house for my first band and selling them on the road. So I knew it was something I wanted to do but it took a crazy long time for the Dim Mak collection to be ready. We wanted to showcase it in the right way and so we turned the runway into a skate ramp so the energy of the [clothing] line was matched visually by what people were seeing as the skaters modelled the clothes. You didn't bother training models to skate then? That would have been a disaster, we got some of New York's best skaters that really knew how to rep the brand. Lots of articles claimed New York fashion week was notable for how political some of the shows were. What is it like being a creative person working in Donald Trump's America? Especially as a second-generation immigrant. This is probably the worst period of time that I have lived in America, under this dictator-style, fascist president who is pushing his regime and clearing the rights of minorities, immigrants, women, the LGBT community, across the board - there are major steps backwards. But one thing is for certain - the world is noticing that America itself is coming together and uniting as a voice. That's why punk happened in the early 70s because it was the voice of protest and rebellion post-Vietnam and now its happening again. We're having a renaissance. I'm excited about the voices and the people that are going to be speaking out. There's a lot of creative spirit, especially in music and the arts and fashion, it's all part of a larger thing. The Rage Against The Machines of the world, they're going to come back and inspire more people. Can we expect some politically-charged material from you? I can't help it, it's in my DNA and I'm not one to sit on the fence especially when something like this has shown its face. When I post something political or anti-Trump on my Facebook, some of the comments I get, you can't believe how much ignorance is out there. I might lose some fans by not staying neutral but I don't have a choice, I have to use my voice. Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

"By Lauren TurnerEntertainment reporter But sadly for her, and her legion of fans, it was simply a typo. Soon, #NoAmyAdams was trending on Twitter. ""How could she not be nominated for Oscar?"" asked one. Another wrote: ""Ugh they did not just snub Amy Adams."" So why was it such a surprise the star failed to pick up a nomination, either for her role in best picture nominee Arrival, or for her other Oscar contender, Tom Ford's Nocturnal Animals? Arrival's director says she is the 'soul' of the film Denis Villeneuve, director of the sci-fi film that sees Adams' linguist character Louise Banks attempt to speak to aliens, is no doubt pleased it is up for best picture. But he could not hide his sadness the star missed out. ""This is the big disappointment,"" Villeneuve told US media. ""I'm deeply disappointed for Amy. ""She was the soul of this movie. For me, it was a given! She had the movie on her shoulders, she's the one who made it happen. ""It's a strange feeling to celebrate and feel sad at the same time."" The critics loved her performance Film critics were unanimous in their praise of Adams in Arrival. The New York Times said: ""By turns inviting and opaque, Ms Adams turns softness and quiet into heroic qualities, keeping her voice low, modulated, and using stillness to draw you near."" The Los Angeles Times agreed: ""Arrival is really Adams's film, a showcase for her ability to quietly and effectively meld intelligence, empathy and reserve."" The Telegraph said: ""Adams is one of the best actresses Hollywood has."" And it praised ""the supreme subtlety and screwed-down focus of her work"" in the film. Fans loved it too The film topped the UK box office in November after taking £2.9m on its opening weekend - and it's received such a popularity boost in awards season that it's heading back to US cinemas with extra footage. ""Arrival is one awesome film. Must watch. Brilliant acting by Amy Adams,"" Arvind Ramanathan tweeted last month. Anna Escurriola agreed, writing: ""Arrival is extraordinary and the acting of Amy Adams is superb. When I see movies like this I love cinema even more."" Writing after the Oscar nominations had been announced, Christian Kelly said: ""I must say, it is disappointing to not see Amy Adams nominated for Arrival. She was fantastic and drove the story beautifully."" She has been nominated five times before Adams has quietly amassed an impressive list of acclaimed screen roles which has seen her nominated for Oscars five times in just over a decade. She was most recently recognised for playing Sydney Prosser in American Hustle, being nominated for best actress in 2014. She also picked up best supporting actress nods in 2006, 2008, 2011 and 2013 for roles in Junebug, Doubt, The Fighter and The Master. The Academy sometimes likes to reward people who've been waiting for a while for a trophy. Leonardo DiCaprio finally won best actor for The Revenant last year after campaigning by fans in his repeated nominations for other roles. But Adams is yet to pick up the elusive trophy. She was in two Oscar-nominated films this year Arrival picked up a handful of nominations for this year's Oscars, with her other big film Nocturnal Animals scoring one. But did that split the vote and scupper her chance of success? It could well have done. Other actresses who have been nominated this year include Emma Stone and Natalie Portman - for La La Land and Jackie respectively. Their performances in those films have been widely praised and are the only roles both actresses have been associated with this awards season. By appearing in two critically-acclaimed movies near the Oscars, Adams may well have scuppered her own chances of a nomination, with Academy voters splitting their nominations between them. She's been nominated A LOT of times for this role Astonishingly, Adams has received best actress nominations for her part in Arrival at 33 other film awards so far this season - and already won five of them. Among those recognising her include the Golden Globes, Bafta, London Critics Circle and Screen Actors Guild. They can't all be wrong can they?

She says the ensemble was formed ""to change perceptions"" not just for the audience ""but also us musicians ourselves"". The musician added: ""I didn't know if this could exist. I had no idea. At the time [I established the orchestra], I could count on the fingers of one hand how many musicians of ethnicity I had ever worked with, and three of those were singers."" Pianist Gerard Aimontche, who occasionally plays with Chineke! (although not at the Proms) said the project will ""break stereotypes"". ""As you may know, black musicians very often get pigeonholed to jazz or hip-hop. It's a huge stereotype. People may not even know that black classical musicians exist. In reality, there are tons of us. I'm very excited about it."" Opera sounds better at the Proms ""The amazing thing about opera at the Proms is it's like lifting the lid on the engine of opera, because you can see into the orchestra all the time. It's like you're enmeshed in it,"" says Radio 3's Tom Service. ""The storytelling is actually much more vivid because there isn't scenery, because there isn't a director in the way. ""You're forced to focus on the interactions between the singers, and you see what's happening with the musicians. You feel part of the drama. That's the unique thing about opera at the Proms."" Tom recommends the following operas from the 2017 programme: Beethoven's Fidelio (21 July); Mussorgsky's Khovanshchina (6 August); and Mozart's La clemenza di Tito (28 August). Tickets are still available A BBC Proms concert at the Royal Albert Hall is never ""sold out"" before the day of the performance, because for each Prom up to 1,350 standing, or ""Promming"" places are available in the arena and gallery on the day. Queuing for those tickets is all part of the experience. But which should you plump for? ""As someone who's been Promming since I've been 13, here's my secret: If you stand in the middle of the arena, that is the best place in the entire arena to listen to the Prom,"" says BBC Radio 3's Sara Mohr-Pietsch. Her co-presenter Petroc Trelawney disagrees. ""I want to make a cry for the gallery because I love going up there,"" he told BBC Radio 2's Steve Wright Show. ""Downstairs in the arena, everyone's packed in and standing up. Up there, people are lying down. People bring cushions and blankets, they bring a little picnic to have in the interval. And the sound up there is extraordinary. [It] sort of gets whooshed up through the hall and it sounds fantastic."" The relaxed Prom On 29 July, the BBC National Orchestra of Wales will stage the first ever ""relaxed Prom"", delivering classical music in an informal environment. ""It's specifically designed not just for families, but also for adults with autism, sensory impairments and learning difficulties,"" says Tom Service. ""The message is simple to anyone who comes along: You can do what you want. You can talk, you can relate to each other however you like to. It's going to be a wonderful experience."" The broadcaster points out that this casual atmosphere used to be the norm. ""If you rewind 150, 200 years, it wasn't the case that everyone was sitting in silence and worshipping the music. ""The concerts were much more like being at Glasto and Latitude. So, for me, the relaxed Prom is a return to classical music's roots."" Tom Jones is making his debut Sir Tom Jones will make his first ever appearance at the Proms as part of a celebration of soul record label Stax Records. The singer will take part in a concert celebrating the Memphis-based label, performing tracks such as (Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay and Soul Man alongside Stax stars Booker T Jones and Sam Moore. There will also be appearances by Beverley Knight, James Morrison and Ruby Turner. ""What a voice and what a personality,"" said David Pickard, who books the Proms for the BBC. ""Stax is really interesting. Their first big tour to the UK was 50 years ago, and Tom Jones is one of hundreds of artists who were hugely influenced by them."" It's all being streamed in high-definition audio The BBC has been broadcasting the Proms for the past 90 years, and to mark the anniversary, BBC Radio 3 is streaming the entire event in lossless audio. In layman's terms, the concerts won't be compressed or squashed like an MP3 (which chucks out sounds the human ear can't hear). If you're interested in the nuts-and-bolts of what's being called ""concert quality audio"", there's a BBC blog post. This audio won't be available on your radio, though. You'll need to go to the Proms website or the BBC Radio 3 website to experience it. One of the Proms is a repeat Prom 13, on 24 July, recreates a concert that originally took place in 1966. It's to honour Malcolm Sargent, who was chief conductor of the Proms from 1947 until his death in 1967. ""We are recreating his 500th Prom,"" says Petroc Trelawney. ""Isn't that amazing? One man conducted more than 500 Proms. ""Now we have dozens of conductors each year. But back then. you just had one or two conductors. So we have got all of Malcolm Sargent's hits, if you like, from that 500th Prom he did."" There are symphonies aplenty ""Symphonies are the bread and butter of the Proms,"" says Tom Service, who picks Elgar's first and second symphonies as his personal Proms highlights. The symphonies will be played on 15 and 16 July by the Staatskapelle Berlin, conducted by Daniel Barenboim. ""This is one of the most characterful and deep and warm and emotional orchestras in the world,"" he told BBC 6 Music. ""You'll know Elgar from the £20 note, with that Edwardian moustache. There's an idea that he represents old-world imperialism [but] this music is shot through with a genuinely radical spirit and an emotion that cuts you to the quick. ""It's there from the first bar of the first symphony. And the second symphony is, for me, literally devastatingly moving. ""You're going to have the most shattering, private intimate emotions on show here. And if you go there with Barenboim and Elgar's music, you're going to discover things about yourself, not just the symphony.""

"The case, which has been dubbed the ""war on terrier"", will be heard on 18 April in Queensland. The actress is facing two counts of knowingly importing a prohibited product in breach of the Quarantine Act. A court official told AFP that Heard is required to appear at the hearing. Heard came under fire for failing to declare Pistol and Boo, the couple's Yorkshire terriers, to authorities on their arrival in Brisbane in April. Under strict Australian laws designed to keep disease at bay, dogs entering from the US must be declared and have to spend 10 days in quarantine. Hefty fine The case sparked global attention after the terriers were threatened with death by Australia's Agriculture Minister Barnaby Joyce, unless they went ""back to the United States"". Mr Joyce said he did not care if Depp had been voted the ""sexiest man alive"", he still had to adhere to quarantine rules. The animals, which had allegedly travelled by private jet to Queensland, where Depp was filming Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales, were quickly whisked out of the country as the story hit the headlines. In July she was charged with two counts of illegally importing the dogs into Australia and one count of producing a false document. Penalties range from a hefty fine to more than 10 years in prison. An earlier hearing set for September was adjourned. After the incident in May, Heard vowed never to return to Australia, although reports earlier this month said she ""respected Australia's laws"" and was looking forward to ""attending the hearing of these matters"". Twelve witnesses are listed to give evidence but it is not known whether Depp is one of them.",A date has been set for Johnny Depp's wife Amber Heard to face a court trial in Australia for allegedly smuggling her two dogs into the country.
"By Ian YoungsArts reporter, BBC News So, how have they fared? Are they having to close, or have efforts to raise more money elsewhere allowed them to flourish without subsidy? Northumberland Theatre Company The Northumberland Theatre Company (NTC), which has been taking plays to village halls and community centres for 20 years, has lost £337,000 of annual Arts Council income. ""The crucial thing that's kept us going and buoyed us up has been the support of our audiences and all the people that work with us,"" says artistic director Gillian Hambleton. The company has been brainstorming to come up with new ways of rustling up cash. The actors now explain the company's predicament to audiences after every show before bringing out a donations pot. There is a new friends and family scheme, which audiences can pay to join, while prominent buttons on their website offer ways to donate. One fan is crime writer Val McDermid, who has helped out by letting the company adapt her short stories for the stage for free and sell the books afterwards. One of her stories is part of NTC's current tour, 4 Words. The company is putting its expertise to use in other ways - Hambleton is giving audition masterclasses to university students and actors are being seconded to the NHS for training exercises. ""We've not just been sitting on our laurels hoping somebody's going to give us some money,"" Hambleton says. Ticket prices But while the various fundraising schemes will help, there will still be a sizeable shortfall. The company has had to cut its apprenticeship scheme for budding theatre workers. Hambleton says the company has pared down its own running costs as far as possible, and cannot raise ticket prices or booking fees any further. ""We did a lot of research and our fees are the highest among comparable companies,"" she says. ""So you can only raise things so far before people stop coming or stop booking you."" The NTC has bid for funds from a different Arts Council pot, the Strategic Touring Fund. They find out about that in April and their summer and autumn show, A Midsummer Night's Dream - and the future of the company - depends on it. Northumberland Theatre Company's 4 Words completes its tour in Washington, Etal and Longhirst this week. Kompany Malakhi, Bristol Bristol-based dance group Kompany Malakhi closed two weeks ago after losing its £159,000-a-year grant. Former artistic director Kwesi Johnson admits that they did not meet some of the Arts Council targets in relation to bringing in new audiences and different sources of income. And he accepts that they are ""quite within their rights"" to withdraw their money if it is not achieving their aims. ""It's public money at the end of the day,"" he says. So no complaints? ""If I complained it would be wasted energy,"" the choreographer says. ""I'd rather put my energy into new ideas and in actual fact, it has brought about a completely different mindset."" Johnson did not try to replace the Arts Council money because applying to trusts, foundations and charities would have been pointless, he believes. ""They're not going to invest in something when they know it's going to have a massive chunk of its core funding withdrawn,"" he says. ""Trying to find alternative forms of funding was near impossible, so that's why we decided to close it in its current structure."" The company employed four people, with 12 freelancers looking after tasks like marketing and education work. And the new mindset? Although the company has closed, Johnson says: ""We've stopped doing it in the way we were doing it, we've not stopped doing it."" Not having the Arts Council's ""restrictive"" criteria to meet and boxes to tick has given him a new freedom, Johnson says. ""I feel like a recording artist being released from Sony or EMI or something like that."" He is planning new digital projects that do not revolve around making a show for theatres. And this time, he will look for commercial partners. ""I'm thinking more of investment, and investment is about making profit and about being able to make things exist rather than it being a charity,"" he says. ""So if we're talking about stuff to do with health, we might go to Bupa or Simply Health or companies like that. ""At the end of the day, the people that got cut, we're artists and we make things happen and we think creatively. And we just have to think creatively in another format. It's not the end of the world."" Kwesi Johnson's latest workSoundClash, presented by Phoenix Dance Theatre, can be seen in Bristol and Newcastle in May. Writers In Prison Network ""It knocked us to the floor,"" says Writers In Prison co-director Clive Hopwood of the Arts Council decision to end its £154,000-a-year grant. ""Then we got angry - why us?"" he continues. ""Next we got up and went: 'Right, what can we do?'"" Writers In Prisons organises authors' residencies in jails across the UK in the belief that creative writing can help rehabilitation. ""We passionately believe in what we do,"" Hopwood says. ""Passionately. And we can't let it go away. There is nobody else doing what we do. It was very, very important that we made sure that we're still here."" There were three options when the cuts were announced, Hopwood says. ""One is - you just give up. That wasn't on the cards. Another was to reduce ourselves to some little seed and survive under the permafrost for three or four years until light appears. That wouldn't work either because you're not really fulfilling what the organisation's about. ""So the other alternative was to do exactly the opposite and grow our way out of it."" Writers In Prison has not cut back on the number of residencies and is trying to branch out by offering workshops in related areas, such as probation or pupil referral units, in the hope of generating income from those activities. ""We will keep doing exactly what we're doing at the same level,"" Hopwood says. ""We know there's a wall somewhere in the distance when we run out of money. ""But we thought if we hit the wall at 200mph, at least we've been doing our damnedest to survive."" The organisation has had a separate Arts Council subsidy to pay for staff to develop fundraising activities and new customers. Apart from that, it also has enough money saved to keep going for another six months. ""We still have no guarantee that we're going to be here in six months' time but we're more confident that it can be done,"" Hopwood says. Castlefield Gallery, Manchester The Castlefield gallery, which specialises in showing emerging and experimental artists, lost its ongoing £92,000-a-year Arts Council grant. Like the other two featured organisations that have also kept going, it has received money from a different Arts Council pot. It has had a cheque for £98,000 for the next two years under the Grants For the Arts scheme, which gives money for set time periods. That will keep the gallery going, but director Kwong Lee says the cut forced the gallery to re-examine its purpose. He has decided it must focus on its strengths and be ""sharper"" - acknowledging that it was a little fuzzy around the edges before. ""It's about looking at what we do best and doing those things better, but also making sure people know about them,"" he says. Castlefield's unique selling point, he says, is ""talent development"" - giving promising artists their first proper exhibition or plugging them into the region's arts network. As such, the gallery has gone back to all artists who have exhibited there in the past to ask for works to auction to raise funds. Those who have donated art include Turner Prize winner Mark Leckey, Rachel Goodyear, Pavel Buchler and Lubaina Himid. The gallery will also try to make money by renting out office space and hosting corporate events, while staff expertise can be offered to companies wishing to hang art collections, or universities, Lee says. ""I think we're going to have to be much more entrepreneurial in terms of earning income and it will take a bit of time as well,"" he says.","A year ago, more than 200 theatre, art and other cultural organisations were told that they would be taken off the list of bodies receiving regular Arts Council England funding. They were given a year's notice and that money runs out this week."
"The pop star tumbled down a flight of steps during her performance last week when a dancer tried to pull away her Armani-designed matador cape. She said the garment, which was supposed to fall off her shoulders, had been fastened too tightly. Armani responded: ""The cape had a hook and she wanted a tie, and she wasn't able to open it with her hands. ""That's all there is to it. Madonna, as we all know, is very difficult."" The 80-year-old was talking to the Associated Press following his show at Milan Fashion week. Madonna's wardrobe malfunction went viral minutes immediately after it was broadcast live on ITV1. She later told chat show host Jonathan Ross she had suffered ""a little bit of whiplash"" after the fall. The 56-year-old said her cape had been tied ""really tight around my neck"" because ""everyone was worried"" it would slide off. ""I got to the top of the stairs and I pulled the silky string, and it wouldn't come undone,"" she continued. ""I had two choices: I could either be strangled or fall, and I chose to fall. ""I smacked the back of my head. And I had a man standing over me with a flashlight until about 3am to make sure I was compos mentis."" She added: ""I know how to fall, I have fallen off my horse many times."" Following the incident, the star's stylist, B Akerlund, posted a picture of herself lying on the floor covered in smashed cupcakes. It is not known whether the Swedish-born stylist, who has worked with Madonna for nine years, tied the cape herself, though she came in for abuse from fans nonetheless. ""Please improve your work, she [Madonna] is a QUEEN don't deserve this,"" said one.",Fashion designer Giorgio Armani has played down his part in Madonna's on-stage fall at this year's Brit Awards.
"Before meeting Harry, she had been best known for playing lawyer Rachel Zane in US TV drama Suits. When she became a member of the Royal Family, she gave up her acting career - and immersed herself in the life of a working royal, using the platform to highlight the charities and causes close to her heart. She became a mother in May 2019 but within a year she and Prince Harry had stepped away as working members of the Royal Family and started a new life in North America. Early life Born Rachel Meghan Markle on 4 August 1981, she grew up in a prosperous part of Los Angeles. Her mother's home is in an area known as the ""Black Beverly Hills"", where the average price of a home is $771,000 (£587,000). Meghan went to a private primary school in Hollywood and started campaigning for gender equality at an early age. At 11, she wrote a letter to the then US first lady, Hillary Clinton, lamenting a washing-up liquid's TV ad strapline: ""Women all over America are fighting greasy pots and pans."" Within a month, manufacturers Procter and Gamble had changed the word ""women"" to ""people"". ""It was at that moment that I realised the magnitude of my actions,"" she later said. ""I had created my small level of impact by standing up for equality."" At 15, she was volunteering in soup kitchens as her studies continued at a girls' Roman Catholic college, and she graduated from Northwestern University School of Communication, near Chicago, in 2003. A stint working as an intern at the US embassy in Argentina made her think her path might lead her into politics, but she changed course when her acting career began to take off. Between auditions, she has told of making money by doing calligraphy for wedding invitations, using skills developed in handwriting classes at school. Her father was a cinematographer on the hit 1980s show Married... With Children, and her first television appearance in the US was in an episode of the medical drama General Hospital in 2002, before moving on to roles in CSI, Without a Trace and Castle. There were leading roles in TV movies such as When Sparks Fly and Dater's Handbook, and bit parts in Hollywood films including Get Him to the Greek, Remember Me and Horrible Bosses, and she was a ""briefcase girl"" on the US version of game show Deal or No Deal. She also appeared in the sci-fi series Fringe, playing FBI special agent Amy Jessup, but her most famous role was in Suits. Meghan was in the show from its launch in 2011, but was written out in the finale of the seventh series. Fittingly, perhaps, she left after her character got married. In real life, Meghan's union with Prince Harry wasn't her first marriage. In September 2011, she wed film producer Trevor Engelson, but the pair divorced two years later. In September, it was reported that her ex-husband was producing a new TV show based on a man's custody battle with his ex-wife who marries into the Royal Family. In 2014, she began writing about topics such as food, beauty, fashion and travel, as well as her own story, on her lifestyle website The Tig. Meghan said setting up the website was an attempt to ""reframe the beauty content to include think pieces about self-empowerment"" and feature dynamic, inspirational women. In one post, she explained: ""I've never wanted to be a lady who lunches - I've always wanted to be a woman who works."" The site also carried candid blogs she wrote on every birthday. On turning 33 in 2014, she wrote: ""My 20s were brutal - a constant battle with myself, judging my weight, my style, my desire to be as cool/as hip/as smart/as 'whatever' as everyone else."" She also grew a large social network profile, with 1.9 million followers on Instagram and more than 350,000 on Twitter. But she shut The Tig in April 2017, and deleted her social accounts January 2018. Her media career has gone hand-in-hand with support for causes that are important to her. She tackled the issue of the stigma around menstrual health in an article for Time magazine in March 2017 and was a global ambassador for World Vision Canada, which campaigns for better education, food and healthcare for children around the world. As part of her role, the actress travelled to Rwanda for the charity's Clean Water Campaign. Meghan's commitment to gender equality has seen her work with the United Nations, and she received a standing ovation from an audience including UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon for a stirring speech on International Women's Day 2015. Commenting on how she combined acting with campaigning, she said: ""While my life shifts from refugee camps to red carpets, I choose them both because these worlds can, in fact, co-exist. And for me, they must."" Meghan, whose father is white and mother is African-American, has also spoken about coming to terms with her racial identity. In an article for Elle magazine, she wrote: ""While my mixed heritage may have created a grey area surrounding my self-identification, keeping me with a foot on both sides of the fence, I have come to embrace that. ""To say who I am, to share where I'm from, to voice my pride in being a strong, confident mixed-race woman."" Marriage to Prince Harry In late 2016, Prince Harry confirmed he was in relationship with Meghan - while issuing a statement accusing journalists of harassing her. The pair had met on a blind date, organised by a mutual friend. After just two dates, they went on holiday together to Botswana. In September 2017 Meghan told Vanity Fair magazine they were ""two people who are really happy and in love"". And in an interview that November, when their engagement was announced, Prince Harry admitted he had never heard of Meghan before his friend introduced them, and was ""beautifully surprised"". Meghan and Prince Harry got married at St George's Chapel, Windsor, on 19 May 2018. Royal Tours and engagements Meghan and Prince Harry embarked on their first royal tour together in October 2018 - visiting Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga over 16 days. The trip coincided with the couple announcing they were expecting their first baby. The duke and duchess followed in the footsteps of Prince Harry's parents - Prince Charles and Diana, Princess of Wales - whose first royal tour was to Australia and New Zealand. In September 2019, the couple undertook a 10-day tour of Africa, a continent that has always been particularly dear to Prince Harry's heart, leading to some speculation early in their marriage that they might at some stage choose to live there. Meghan met Archbishop Desmond Tutu and Sophia Williams-De Bruyn, as well as other key figures in South Africa's anti-apartheid movement. She also made a speech to business people in Johannesburg in which she said such entrepreneurs had the power to change a world that seems ""aggressive, confrontational and dangerous"". But by the end of the tour, the couple's talk about fighting injustice was being reported alongside news that they were beginning legal action against the Mail on Sunday for publishing a private letter sent by the Duchess of Sussex to her father. Becoming a mother When Meghan gave birth to her son Archie Harrison - on 6 May 2019 - the reaction from the New York Times reflected the mass interest in the event around the world as it wrote: ""He is the first multiracial baby in the British monarchy's recent history, an instant star in a country where multiracial children make up the fastest-growing ethnic category."" But the royal couple had already decided to do things a little differently, underlining their determination not to follow the traditions of other recent royal births. In advance, they chose not to reveal where the baby would be born and said there would be no running commentary of what was happening, instantly stopping the spectacle of the press pack joining the ranks of ""royal superfans"" camped outside a hospital for several days waiting for the first glimpse of the new royal. And the birth wasn't initially announced in the traditional royal way of being posted on a placard outside Buckingham Palace. Instead, Prince Harry popped out of their home to tell the world (although the placard then followed). The very private christening that followed just added to some media frustration that they could not, in their minds, fully report on one of the year's happiest stories. Held at Windsor Castle, the ceremony was not witnessed by any press photographers or TV cameras and the list of guests and godparents was not made public. BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond surmised: ""It all points to a very different royal event, part of the continuing desire by the duke and duchess to raise their son Archie out of the spotlight."" A very public departure from royal life Amid ongoing spats with the media, increasingly through lawyers, it would soon become clear that both Meghan and her husband were becoming increasingly disenchanted with the expectations that came with their royal role. The announcement in June 2019 that they were breaking away from the Royal Foundation charity - which had seen them work closely with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge - led to frenzied speculation about Prince Harry and Meghan's relationship with Prince William and Catherine. Then there was the revelation that their home, Frogmore Cottage, had been renovated with £2.4m of taxpayer-funded costs. Meghan's comments during the couple's African tour that she had not felt supported as she struggled with motherhood and her new role did not go down well with senior royals, according to sources at the time. At the end of 2019, the couple took an extended Christmas break from royal duties, taking Archie to the Canadian province of British Columbia. It gave them time to mull over their next move and, within days of the start of a new decade, they dropped the bombshell announcement that they planned to step back as senior royals and become financially independent. Amid the further detail that the couple planned to split their time between the UK and North America, Buckingham Palace expressed its disappointment as palace sources revealed that that no other royal - including the Queen or Prince William - was consulted before the statement was issued. Talks then ensued between Prince Harry and the Queen to iron out the details before it was confirmed that their couple's final duties as working members of the Royal Family would be in March 2020. The very final engagement saw them attend the Commonwealth Day service at Westminster Abbey. The Queen, Prince Charles and Prince William were all there although one of the abiding memories of Meghan's royal exit - by now widely renamed ""Megxit"" - was getting a hug from singer Craig David. The couple will still attend some royal events in the future but these will not be classed as official duties. A new life in LA - and fighting new battles Although some time was spent in Canada, the couple have largely settled at a new home in California. That does of course allow them to spend much more time with Meghan's mother Doria Ragland, who lives in the state. But they are never completely out of the spotlight. There was a media fascination in tracking the couple's whereabouts in the early days of the coronavirus lockdown. In April 2020, they sued and eventually won an apology from a US news agency after drones were allegedly used to take pictures of their son, Archie, at their home. The same month, the couple announced that they were ending all co-operation with four tabloid newspaper groups in the UK, blaming ""distorted, false or invasive"" stories. But they do remain keen to seek publicity for the causes or issues they are interested in. As a duchess, Meghan took on portfolio of charitable work and patronages, which included the National Theatre and charity Smart Works. She also launched a charity cookbook in September 2018 to help those affected by the Grenfell Tower fire. After moving back to the US, she jointly wrote a newspaper article calling for the end of ""structural racism"" and the couple also urged US citizens to vote in the presidential election, saying that they should ""reject hate"". In November 2020, Meghan wrote an article revealing her ""almost unbearable grief"" at enduring a miscarriage in July of that year. A source close to the duchess confirmed to the BBC that the couple wanted to talk about what happened having come to appreciate how common miscarriage is. As for their future career plans, a big clue came when they reached a deal with streaming giant Netflix to make a range of programmes, some of which they may appear in. Days later, they repaid the costs of Frogmore Cottage. As BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond pointed out, that means ""the couple may perceive themselves to be free of any of the obligations they once laboured under"".

"By Ian YoungsEntertainment reporter He is a one-man multi-skilled music-making machine - he sings, writes, plays numerous instruments and produces his own records. His songs combine classic melodies with the warps and beats of cutting-edge music, as if he has fed the influence of idols like Stevie Wonder, Tom Waits and Stevie Ray Vaughan through a modern pop super-computer. He also jumps between genres with glee, flipping between the haunting electronica of James Blake and the soulful guitar-based balladry of Ed Sheeran. His voice, meanwhile, can go from a Tom Waits growl up to a Sam Smith soar. And he has a very hip beard. The combination of these qualities means he has found himself riding the zeitgeist. As well as topping the BBC Sound of 2016 list, he has won the Brits Awards Critics' Choice prize and the BBC Introducing trophy at the BBC Music Awards. Never in this history of music tips has one artist been so vigorously feted. Now, with his debut album Phase due out in February, all that is left to do is to prove the tipsters right. The story so far A star is born He was born, to be precise, on 11 October 1991 in High Wycombe Hospital in Buckinghamshire. His mum was a primary school music teacher and dad a police officer. ""The thing that was most constant when I was growing up was just complete support and adoration from my parents,"" he says. He admits to being a show-off as a child, so his parents tried to channel that attention-seeking streak into activities like acting and singing. ""I would sing around the house and I would always play on things just because instruments were always there, but I didn't show any genius as a child. I wasn't a prodigy or anything like that. ""I just really enjoyed making noises and really enjoyed the reaction that I got from making those noises. So they put me on music lessons to encourage me to hone in on that talent rather than show off."" The musical awakening ""My mum would play Stevie Wonder around the house and I remember just loving the songs and feeling so blown away by how much was going on,"" Garratt recalls. ""At that age, I mentally couldn't fathom the amount of detail. I just loved the tones and the melody and Stevie Wonder's energy behind his singing. ""That was the first real awakening. Then the first time I discovered Tom Waits for myself. He became, and still is, a very, very important voice and inspiration to my lyric-writing and my songwriting."" Garratt was also into Californian singer Jackson Browne at the time. Although the two troubadours have very different vocal styles, he heard similarities between Waits and Browne. ""I genre-hop quite a lot,"" he explains. ""I love manipulating genre and deconstructing it and making it irrelevant. Genreless music is great because it means you get to write in any genre that you like. ""That was a really inspiring moment for me, to see folk music be completely blown apart by two completely separate voices, but still be able to find the tangible link between them."" Nul points at Junior Eurovision As a cheeky 13-year-old, Garratt tried to be the UK's entrant at Junior Eurovision with a composition called The Girl. The national qualification was broadcast on ITV2 - but his song came last. ""That was the first time I tried to achieve anything as a musician, but my intentions were wrong,"" he said recently. ""I did it more for attention rather than for a love of what I was doing."" Pressing self destruct That disappointment did not put Garratt off, and he kept writing and performing while he worked as a teaching assistant with a boy with cerebral palsy during a gap year after secondary school, and then training to be a teacher at university. At the time, he was working on an album with an independent label. Thanks to YouTube, we can see him in his bluesy pre-beard days. But then he called it all off - his training and his album. He disagreed with much of what his course was teaching him, and at the same time lost confidence in his music. ""I dropped out of uni and had to re-evaluate everything because I wasn't happy in what I was doing,"" he says. ""I was trying so hard to achieve something for the wrong reasons. I wasn't proud of the songs I was writing, and I was performing the music because I liked the way that people reacted rather than because I was proud of the songs. ""When I dropped out of uni I had a real self-destructive moment where I had to break myself apart. ""I felt like I was going through a quarter or a midlife crisis, but I was not even 20, and that freaked me out even more. But thankfully I had to make some harsh decisions and I think I made the right ones."" On the right path One of the decisions was to enlist one of his best friends as his manager. He went back to square one. ""I could go up on stage and play guitar fast and sing loud and people were impressed by that, but until I knew I had the right songs under my belt I was just using loud singing and fast guitar playing as cheap tricks, gimmicks, to fool people into thinking I'm a better musician than I actually am,"" he says. ""So instead, what I actually needed to do was to lock myself away and spend the year writing the best songs that I could. ""The minute I started to treat music with a totally different level of respect and integrity, everything changed and suddenly things started to fall into place. ""I found my way back to a path that I felt was very familiar, but knew I'd never walked on before."" That process brought him to the attention of the management company that launched the careers of previous Sound Of... winners Ellie Goulding and Jessie J, and then Island Records. The big breaks Garratt points to appearances on the BBC Introducing stage at the 2014 Reading Festival and at BBC Radio 1's Future Festival last January as key moments, after which people started to sit up and take notice. He also supported Mumford and Sons on their recent UK arena tour, before now being showered with these pre-emptive awards. ""I am still fixed firmly onto the ground,"" he insists. ""I have got a small but very good team of people around me. Things are going very, very well but I am just seeing it as that. I am trying to stay as grounded as possible. ""It is difficult because I don't ever want to give the impression that I'm not grateful because I am so unbelievably, overwhelmingly grateful for this. ""But I also have to be dangerous about how personally I take it because I know who I am as a person, and I have worked very hard on myself to not let this kind of success get to my head in any other way other than what it is, which is so utterly complimentary."" The rest of the Sound of 2016 shortlist: More on the Sound of 2016:","Jack Garratt, who has come top of the BBC Sound of 2016 list, seems to embody most of the qualities a pop star should need to survive and thrive in the fickle 21st Century music industry."
"The film's trailer attracted more ""dislikes"" than any trailer ever on YouTube, which suggested a concerted campaign by some fans of the original. The Guardian is one of the papers that gives the film four stars: ""Call off the trolls - Paul Feig's female reboot is a blast,"" it said. ""Fun oozes from almost every frame,"" Nigel M Smith said. ""Most crucially, the mean-spirited reception to the film before anyone had seen it does not seem to have put a dampener on the movie itself."" 'Girls rule' Robbie Collin in The Telegraph said: ""The 2016 vintage of Ghostbusters speaks to its time with the same withering comic accuracy and hot-air-balloon-sized sense of fun as the 1984 original."" The New York Times' Manohla Dargis said: ""the new, cheerfully silly Ghostbusters is that rarest of big-studio offerings — a movie that is a lot of enjoyable, disposable fun. ""Girls rule, women are funny, get over it."" Empire magazine has given the film three stars. Jonathan Pile said: ""an effectively spooky opening gives way to a film that's fun, funny and full of energy. It's almost as if it never mattered that the four main characters were women. Strange that."" While Screen International's critic Tim Grierson said the remake was ""a consistently funny pleasure"". ""Never quite as sharp or inspired as the 1984 original, but radiating such good cheer that comparisons between the two films don't much matter."" But not all reviews were positive. Vanity Fair critic Richard Lawson was one of those not so impressed. He called it ""a flat, occasionally charming disappointment"". ""It spends so much time doing battle with its legacy that it forgets to be its own movie, putting a talented cast to waste and marking another disappointment in this dreadful summer movie season."" Chief film critic Peter Debruge with Variety agreed - he said the film spent ""far too much energy channelling the original to establish its own identity."" Hollywood Reporter, David Rooney said: ""The unfunny mess that hits theatres Friday, like a big goopy splat of ectoplasm, will no doubt make those naysayers feel vindicated. ""But the fact is that an oestrogen-infused makeover, particularly one with such a comedically gifted cast, was a promising idea. Sadly, that's where the inventiveness ended."" 'Nervous about the movie' The film, which stars Melissa McCarthy, Leslie Jones, Kate McKinnon and Kristen Wiig, had its world premiere in Los Angeles on 9 July. Speaking at the premiere Ghostbusters director Paul Feig said he understood fans were ""nervous"" about the film. ""I understand people are very passionate about this movie ... I get it. People are nervous. If I wasn't doing the movie, I would have been nervous. ""All I can say is we came to it with such a purity of spirit and so desperate to give a new audience what we all felt 32 years ago when we first saw it in a theatre."" Jamie East, film editor for The Sun, was one critic who received tweets questioning whether he had been paid for his review. He tweeted: ""Ignore the haters - #Ghostbusters is really, really good."" Helen O'Hara, who reviewed the film for GQ, was also questioned by fans online about her positive review. ""Ghostbusters is a very, very funny and occasionally scary movie, which features jokes aimed squarely at the misogynistic commenters who risked RSI attacking it for its female-led cast,"" she said.

Williams will also be remembered at the Primetime Emmy Awards on 25 August. Plans are under way for a ""proper and meaningful remembrance"", said executive producer Don Mischer. Williams made an appearance at last year's ceremony during an In Memoriam segment to his comic mentor, Jonathan Winters. Actor Simon Pegg has become the latest celebrity to pay tribute to Williams, who will be heard voicing a dog in Pegg's upcoming comedy Absolutely Anything. Williams, said Pegg at the premiere of his new film Hector and the Search for Happiness, was ""an extraordinary man and performer"" who had ""absolutely"" been one of his comedy heroes. ""If anything positive can come from such an awful thing, it's that people will maybe take depression a bit more seriously,"" the Shaun of the Dead star added. Williams, who took his own life on Monday, was said to have been ""battling severe depression"" in the months leading up to his death. Singer Sinead O'Connor also paid tribute to the Dead Poets Society star by dedicating a concert in London to him on Tuesday. The Irish performer went on to say ""the choice that Robin made"" was ""a very bad idea"" and urged anyone ""contemplating that choice"" to reconsider. Williams, a dedicated fan of computer games, is also to be memorialised by Blizzard Entertainment, the company behind the popular World of Warcraft series. ""You gave us so much joy in our lives and we hope you enjoyed your time in our world,"" its makers tweeted. ""We'll see you in-game."" The cast of Broadway show Aladdin also paid tribute to the star with an impromptu curtain call sing-along of Friend Like Me. Williams provided the voice of the Genie in the 1992 Disney cartoon, a character recreated on stage by Tony award winner James Monroe Iglehart.

"The show, which won 11 Tony Awards on Sunday, will open at the Victoria Palace Theatre in October 2017. With a score that blends hip-hop, jazz, blues, rap and R&B, Hamilton tells the story of America's birth and founding father Alexander Hamilton. ""The support Hamilton has received from our British fans has been incredible,"" Lin-Manuel Miranda said. ""I have been reminded of their love, which is just as our King George would want it to be! I'm thrilled the show will be shared with UK audiences starting in the fall of 2017 at the beautiful Victoria Palace Theatre."" The theatre, owned by stage impresario Sir Cameron Mackintosh, is currently undergoing an extensive multi-million pound refurbishment. Sir Cameron said: ""Just occasionally in life the stars align as they have now, and I have the perfect theatre available for one of the most brilliant, original and entertaining musicals I have ever seen. ""The moment I saw Lin-Manuel's remarkable Hamilton I knew that this was a musical with a phenomenal story and score which will be performed somewhere in the world as long as people want to go to the theatre."" Hamilton's 11 Tonys included three acting prizes and awards for best musical, actor, director, choreography, score and book. It also won the Pulitzer Prize for drama earlier this year. The show, currently in New York at the Richard Rodgers Theatre, has been hailed as ""a landmark American musical"", garnering celebrity fans including Star Wars director JJ Abrams, Jay Z and President Obama. It is based on Ron Chernow's biography of Hamilton, an immigrant from the West Indies who became George Washington's right-hand man during the American War of Independence and was the new nation's first treasury secretary.

"Twelve people died in a cinema showing The Dark Knight Rises in Colorado. They included Jessica Ghawi, 24, whose mother Sandy Phillips told BBC News she was ""horrified"" by the Joker trailers. Warner Bros said the film - which stars Joaquin Phoenix - was not an endorsement of real-world violence. Phoenix walked out of a recent interview when asked about the issue. Sandy Phillips and her husband, Lonnie, who run Survivors Empowered, an anti-gun violence group, wrote to Warner Bros along with three others whose relatives were killed, injured or caught up in the 2012 shooting. Speaking to BBC News, Mrs Phillips said: ""When I first saw the trailers of the movie, I was absolutely horrified. ""And then when I dug a little deeper and found out that it had such unnecessary violence in the movie, it just chilled me to my bones. ""It just makes me angry that a major motion picture company isn't taking responsibility and doesn't have the concern of the public at all."" The families' letter said: ""When we learned that Warner Bros was releasing a movie called Joker that presents the character as a protagonist with a sympathetic origin story, it gave us pause. ""We support your right to free speech and free expression. But as anyone who has ever seen a comic book movie can tell you: with great power comes great responsibility. That's why we're calling on you to use your massive platform and influence to join us in our fight to build safer communities with fewer guns."" The letter asked the studio to lobby for gun reform, help fund survivor funds and gun violence intervention schemes, and end political contributions to candidates who take money from the National Rifle Association. In its response, the studio said it has ""a long history of donating to victims of violence"", including the 2012 cinema shooting in Aurora, Colorado. It added: ""Make no mistake: neither the fictional character Joker, nor the film, is an endorsement of real-world violence of any kind. It is not the intention of the film, the filmmakers or the studio to hold this character up as a hero."" Joker, which is released in the US on 4 October, has received rave reviews and has been tipped for Oscar nominations, but is also stirring controversy for its portrayals of mental illness and violence. It shows the origin story of Batman's nemesis. Time magazine's Stephanie Zacharek said it was guilty of ""aggressive and possibly irresponsible idiocy"", while Variety's reviewer Owen Gleiberman said the film ""does something that flirts with danger - it gives evil a clown-mask makeover, turning it into the sickest possible form of cool"". IndieWire's critic David Ehrlich wrote that there were ""moments of shocking violence"", and that the ""story can't help but feel aspirational"". Phoenix, who plays the title role, left an interview with the Telegraph when he was asked if he was worried that the film might end up inspiring the kind of people it's about, with potentially tragic results.

"By Tim MastersArts and entertainment correspondent The play will be re-titled Imogen at the London open air theatre this autumn to highlight the role of Cymbeline's daughter. Rice, who is taking over as Globe's first female artistic director, said she had initially baulked at the idea. ""When director Matthew Dunster first suggested it, I flushed red,"" she said. ""But there are no police and no rules. It makes a huge amount of sense. ""Imogen speaks three times more lines than Cymbeline so it really is her story. We are saying women have a strong narrative in these plays."" Announcing her inaugural ""Wonder Season"" on Monday, Rice said she wanted to make Shakespeare's Globe the ""most accessible and inviting space"" in London. She will be theatre's third artistic director, taking over from Dominic Dromgoole when he leaves in April. Rice is currently joint artistic director of the Kneehigh theatre company, based in Cornwall. ""I've got a world of Shakespeare to discover. I've got so much to learn,"" she said. ""I want to remind us of what it's like to be told a story, and what it must have been like in Shakespeare's time to cheer and whoop and feel the spit of actors on our faces."" Rice will open her first season by directing A Midsummer Night's Dream in April. ""It's a play that fits my aesthetic so perfectly,"" she told the BBC. ""It's magical, it's about love and identity and it's got a guy who turns into a donkey."" The season will be accompanied by the installation of ""a magical forest"" of silver birch trees with metallic leaves which will ""spill from the piazza onto London's Bankside"". ""I'm hoping people will walk into the forest and they next thing they know they are watching a play,"" said Rice. Caroline Byrne's production of The Taming of the Shrew, set in Ireland and inspired by the events of the Easter Rising, follows in May. Rice said the play had obsessed her for many years. ""This play taunts us women - Katherine is one of the best characters ever written for a woman - she's flawed, she's passionate, fierce and tricky - and then she's tamed. ""How can we tell this play for the 21st Century? I wanted a young exceptional woman to direct it. I've told her to be brave and fierce."" Other plays in the season include Macbeth, directed by Iqbal Khan, and Kneehigh's 946 The Amazing Story of Adolphus Tips, based on the novel by Michael Morpurgo. Jonathan Pryce will reprise his role as Shylock in Jonathan Munby's The Merchant of Venice which will run at the Liverpool Playhouse, and then tour before returning to the Globe in October.","Shakespeare's Cymbeline is being ""renamed and reclaimed"" as part of Emma Rice's inaugural season at Shakespeare's Globe."
"By Kev GeogheganEntertainment reporter, BBC News The arts and music event on London's South Bank will include performances from the likes of Madness, Yo La Tengo and The Fugs. Davies is also bringing back a live version of 1960s music show Ready Steady Go!, a precursor to Top of The Pops which featured performances from the likes of The Beatles and Jimi Hendrix. Formed in north London in 1964 by Davies' brother Dave, The Kinks played together for 30 years, but the brothers' fractious relationship contributed to the band's demise in the mid-90s. Have you curated a festival on this scale before? Not really like this, the South Bank is an institution and this year being the 60th anniversary is appropriate - it's 60 years since the Festival of Britain kicked off. It opened in 1951 so I've tried to resonate through the decades and get people who have connections with London, with bands like Madness, so its symbolic in many respects. I've never really done anything like this before but I've really enjoyed it. So how does it work, do you come up with a list of artists which the organisers then veto? I had a vision for it, I wrote a two-page proposal with suggested artists and they reflected that in all the side shows and what they've done for the South Bank. They've been very helpful, you know, you can't get everything you need but we tried the best to provide something that's a pretty good balance. Did you have some fun coming up with the list? It was a lot of fun, it's always fun to write your dream ticket but not everybody is always available. I would have liked to have got Bruce Springsteen over for an acoustic set but I'm very pleased with what we have. It's a good list of people. Are you conscious of Meltdown's past curators? Bowie, Scott Walker, John Peel. It's quite an intimidating list. I haven't really thought about what other people have done because they wanted something that was me. It was the same when I was with The Kinks, as an artist I've never thought about what other people do, I just do what I do and I retain that principle in most things. It's difficult I'm sure to pinpoint one thing that you're particularly looking forward to but what do think will be a real highlight of the festival? As a performer, I'm looking forward to doing the last concert. It's going to be the LPO (London Philharmonic Orchestra) and a choir of 90 people with me and the band. We're doing the whole of the Village Green Preservation Society album and I haven't played all those songs together since we recorded them. I went back to the songs and rearranged them. We couldn't reproduce a Kinks record which has its own sonic world, but with the band and the orchestra, it's opened up the songs to be more of a narrative. Will this be the biggest number of musicians you have ever had on stage with you? I think so, we did a show in San Francisco in the height of the hippie days and everybody in the audience kind of ended up on stage although that was more more drug-induced. But seriously I think it's the most musicians I've had on stage playing my songs. Why have you decided to bring back a live version of Ready, Steady Go!? I have such a fond memory of it, I think that it's something that is sadly lacking now. We were allowed to go and be ourselves but now on shows like The X Factor, people go on and it's what the judges want. Ready, Steady Go! encouraged bands to do what they wanted to do. You can't bring the show back but that spirit has to make a return to new music because people love to see raw energy. The Kast Off Kinks (made up of former band members) are also playing so your music will be well-represented through the festival. Yes, though I must stress that it isn't a reunion, the reunion couldn't happen, my brother couldn't do it unfortunately. The rumours never go to bed, he's still thinking about it. I still think about it. Being in a band is being part of amazing team - it's being in a team that I enjoyed. There's something special about growing up together like The Kinks did. The Meltdown festival runs from 10-19 June.","Following in the footsteps of David Bowie, Patti Smith and Morrissey, Ray Davies - founder of The Kinks and widely-regarded as one of the UK's finest songwriters - is curating this year's Meltdown festival."

Drafted in as a last-minute replacement, he replaced Made In Chelsea star Jamie Laing who injured his foot while recording the launch show. After scooping the prize, Kelvin said: ""I am absolutely speechless. I did not expect that, it's just been such a privilege to be here."" Breaking down in tears, he said: ""I think this show represents everything that is amazing with this country. I think the people personify what is great and it's just been an absolute privilege.""

Although Kelvin and Mabuse came second on the judges' scoring, only the public vote counted in the final. The couple began their routines with a sensual rumba to Ain't No Sunshine by Bill Withers for which they scored 39 points, followed by a perfect-score showdance to Shout by The Isley Brothers. Judge Bruno Tonioli said their showdance was ""almost like watching 13 weeks of all the best of Strictly Come Dancing condensed into one dance"".

""I work very hard, I drive people very hard"", he admitted. He was at the helm at the golden age of Bond films and oversaw when the role passed from Sean Connery to Roger Moore in 1973. Speaking about his style of directing he said he wanted value for money. ""In the making of Bond films we are some of the meanest toughest film makers. If we spend a million dollars it had better be up there on the screen.""","Guy Hamilton, who directed four James Bond films, has died aged 93."
"Multiple Grammy Award winner, Shankar was described as ""the godfather of world music"" by George Harrison, the Beatles' lead guitarist. Shankar became a superstar in the Western world, but was always drawn back to the revered traditions of the sitar. Born in April 1920, he spent his early years in the holy city of Benares (Varanasi), in modest circumstances. The family rarely saw Shankar's father, a prominent lawyer, and when Shankar's eldest brother, Uday, made a name for himself in Europe by forming his own dance company, their mother and the other three boys joined him in Paris. Indian 'Mozart' There they mixed with luminaries like the novelist Gertrude Stein, classical guitarist Andres Segovia and the songwriter Cole Porter. Touring Europe and North America, Ravi Shankar performed first as a dancer, but was captivated when the virtuoso Indian musician, ""Baba"" Allauddin Khan, played with the troupe. Back in India, Shankar dedicated himself to seven years of studying the sitar with ""Baba"". ""Khan told me you have to leave everything else and do one thing properly,"" Shankar later said in an interview with the Associated Press. Shankar married his teacher's daughter and, in the late 1940s and early 1950s, built a reputation for himself as a classical soloist and composer of innovative stage musicals and film scores. He later received an Oscar nomination for the film, Gandhi. The violinist Yehudi Menuhin was enchanted by Ravi Shankar's music, comparing his genius to Mozart. The pair became close friends and together issued three volumes of East Meets West recordings. But it was Shankar's 1966 meeting with the Beatles, and especially Harrison, that was to make him a hippie idol. Harrison had already played sitar on the band's Norwegian Wood. Shankar, who was typically direct, said ""it sounded horrible"". Shankar's appearances at the Monterey and Woodstock festivals were not an entirely happy experience. He was disturbed by the drug-taking of the flower power scene and hurt by Indian critics who said he was becoming ""Americanised"". Famous daughters His own doubts that many of his Western audience derived anything meaningful from his music were confirmed at one of the concerts to raise funds for the Bangladesh refugee crisis of 1971, when his three-and-a-half minute tuning session was greeted by an ovation. Shankar set about rebuilding his domestic audience, performing ancient ragas in traditional form, but also retained his international profile. While living with his second wife in San Diego, he enjoyed the blossoming talent on sitar of his daughter, Anoushka, with whom he played on tour. But it was the daughter from an earlier relationship, the multi Grammy-winning singer Norah Jones, who claimed more attention. Shankar continued to be a bridge between East and West right into his 80s. More precious to him, though, were the traditions of India: yoga, dance, the philosophical ideas and, above all, the music. His last performance was with Anoushka on 4 November in Long Beach, California, to mark his 10th decade.","Sitar player and composer Ravi Shankar, who has died aged 92, played a leading role in promoting and popularising classical Indian music around the world. He introduced the Beatles to the Indian sounds that informed their later music."
"Will GompertzArts editor@WillGompertzBBCon Twitter It's written by James Graham, the talented young playwright with a string of West End hits, among which is This House, his satirical take on the Labour government of 1974-79. Graham's work has a depth that goes beyond simply portraying British politics; he is questioning its foundations and structure. And so it is with Brexit: The Uncivil War, a TV movie that doesn't seek to retell a familiar story, but to ask an unfamiliar question: we know who won, but do we know how? Benedict Cumberbatch takes centre stage, swapping his handsome-yet-nerdy Sherlock Holmes persona for his baldy-and-even-more-nerdy Dominic Cummings, Vote Leave's real life campaign director and one-time special adviser to Michael Gove. Cumberbatch presents us with an intense, socially awkward, strategic mastermind with a gentle Durham accent and a penchant for hanging out in stationery cupboards at work. He is aided and abetted by Vote Leave's CEO, Matthew Elliot, played by John Heffernan, as a deferential fixer in King Cummings's court. Rory Kinnear provides the oppo in the shape of Craig Oliver, then No 10's director of communications. There are cameos for Michael Gove (Oliver Maltman), Boris Johnson (Richard Goulding), Nigel Farage (Paul Ryan), and Arron Banks (Lee Boardman): all are no more than glib caricature impersonations, but amusing in a Spitting Image-type way. David Cameron and George Osborne hardly feature at all beyond a second or two of archive footage and - in Cameron's case - as a disembodied voice on a conference call. The film is all about Cummings and how he beat the establishment he despises, while keeping Team Farage's alternative Leave campaign at arm's length. There's a face-off with the old guard Eurosceptic MPs, impromptu market research sessions in local pubs, a controversial red bus emblazed with the £350m-a-week NHS promise, and a park-bench meeting with a young physicist who persuades Cummings to allow his data science firm to use the referendum as an experiment in digital campaigning. And all the while there is the dramatic build-up to Cummings coining Vote Leave's campaign message -Take Back Control. The attention the film gives the slogan succeeds in reflecting its psychological power, and the central role it played in winning the campaign, but it doesn't make for compelling telly. The drama is delivered by Cumberbatch's portrayal of Cummings as an idealistic oddball on the mission of a lifetime. So compelling is the actor's performance, I took to the internet to find out more about the man he plays. I found a YouTube video of Dominic Cummings delivering a talk to a group of communications professionals explaining how Vote Leave won the referendum. It appears to have taken place about a year after the vote, during the 2017 general election. Unlike Graham's TV dramatisation, which will probably be watched by millions, fewer than 1,000 people (at the time of writing) have seen this 30-minute talk by Cummings, although it answers the same question with less make-up and in a fraction of the time. I thoroughly recommend watching it before seeing Brexit: The Uncivil War (Channel 4, Monday at 21:00 GMT). It not only gives you a ""from the horse's mouth"" version of what happened, but also an insight into Cummings's immediate post-vote plan for Boris Johnson that is missing from the film. Of course, it is impossible to tell the entire story in one TV movie. Graham has chosen a specific tale to tell about a character not as well known to the public as others involved, but who had a significant bearing on events. Given the subject it is likely to be contentious, but it is evidently well researched. Cumberbatch met Cummings and Graham credits journalist Tim Shipman and Craig Oliver - both of whom have written books on the referendum - as political consultants. The result is a very watchable TV movie that has a clear structure and a well-defined plot, which falls short because it ends up being a slightly-too-long biopic with an underdeveloped cast of supporting characters, rather than a revelatory edge-of-your seat political thriller that goes right down to the wire: a case maybe, of art failing to imitate life.","This week we are pulling up at the crossroads where art meets politics. It's not the latest Ai Weiwei installation, or a pro-Trump tweet from Kanye, but a TV movie called Brexit: The Uncivil War, a two-hour dramatised account of how Vote Leave won the EU Referendum on 23 June 2016."
"The couple said they were ""floating with love and wonder"" after their daughter's ""safe and healthy arrival"". The pair also shared a black-and-white picture of them holding Daisy's tiny hand. Perry revealed she was pregnant in the music video for her single Never Worn White earlier this year. ""We are floating with love and wonder from the safe and healthy arrival of our daughter,"" the couple said in a statement released via Unicef, a charity supporting disadvantaged children, for which both Perry and Bloom are ambassadors. ""But we know we're the lucky ones and not everyone can have a birthing experience as peaceful as ours was. ""Communities around the world are still experiencing a shortage of healthcare workers and every 11 seconds a pregnant woman or newborn dies, mostly from preventable causes. ""Since Covid-19, many more newborn lives are at risk because of a greater lack of access to water, soap, vaccines and medicines that prevent diseases. As parents to a newborn, this breaks our hearts, as we empathise with struggling parents now more than ever."" The couple said they had set up a donation page to mark Daisy's birth, with the money going towards new mothers and their children. ""We hope your heart can bloom with generosity,"" they added. Earlier this month Perry, whose new album Smile is released on Friday, described being pregnant during a pandemic as an ""emotional rollercoaster"". The singer announced her pregnancy in the video for Never Worn White, revealing a baby bump in the final frames of the four-minute clip. The song's lyrics hinted that she and Bloom planned to walk down the aisle soon, after getting engaged on Valentine's Day last year. US singer Perry, who was previously married to Russell Brand, shot to fame in 2008 with the single I Kissed A Girl, which reached number one in the UK. Her hits since then have included Roar, California Gurls, Firework and Never Really Over. Bloom was previously married to Australian model Miranda Kerr, and they have a son, nine-year-old Flynn.

"By Genevieve HassanEntertainment reporter, BBC News Success here often leads to big rewards during Oscar season, with films such as Slumdog Millionaire, The King's Speech and 12 Years a Slave among the previous winners of Toronto's top prize. But with more than 300 films on offer and only 10 days to watch them in, how do you choose what to see? We've picked out some of the most talked about movies being screened this year. A closer look at the British offerings will be published on Thursday. The Judge Robert Downey Jr makes a return to more serious drama in The Judge opposite veteran actor Robert Duvall. The film, which opens the festival, sees Downey Jr as a big city lawyer who returns home when his father - the town's judge - is suspected of murder. This is Where I Leave You After their father dies, four siblings played by Jason Bateman, Tina Fey, Corey Stoll and Adam Driver, return home to their mother (Jane Fonda) and live under the same roof for a week in this comedy drama. Maps to the Stars David Cronenberg's latest film was well received when it screened in Cannes earlier this year. Starring Julianne Moore - who won best best actress on the French Riviera for her role, John Cusack, Mia Wasikowska and Robert Pattinson, it is a satire on Hollywood while also delving into its darker side. St Vincent Bill Murray stars as a curmudgeonly war veteran who finds himself looking after his neighbour's 12-year-old son Oliver. The improbable pair soon develop a friendship as Vincent takes Oliver to all his usual haunts including the the race track, a strip club and a local dive bar. Wild This is one of two Reese Witherspoon films playing at Toronto - and both see her playing real-life characters. Wild is based on the memoir by US author Cheryl Strayed, chronicling her 1,100-mile hike on the Pacific Crest Trail in a journey of self-discovery. Directed by the Dallas Buyers Club's Jean-Marc Vallee, it has Oscar potential written all over it. The Look of Silence Joshua Oppenheimer's 2012 documentary The Act of Killing was critically acclaimed, picking up a Bafta and and an Oscar nomination along the way. The Look of Silence is a follow-up to the film about the former Indonesian death-squad leaders, featuring a man confronting one of the men who killed his brother. Nightcrawler Jake Gyllenhaal lost 20lbs (9kg) to play the role of Lou Bloom, a drifter and petty thief who stumbles upon the underground world of LA freelance photographers who scour the city for gruesome crime-scene footage. Good Kill Ethan Hawke stars as a fighter pilot turned drone pilot who fights the Taliban via remote control for half of his day, then goes home to his family in the suburbs for the other half. Written and directed by Oscar-nominated Andrew Niccol, this drama explores how one man's psychological, emotional and moral boundaries are challenged by the realities of 21st century warfare. The Equalizer Based on the 1980s TV series starring Edward Woodward, this big screen adaptation stars Denzel Washington as a former special ops commando who helps victims of criminals. Directed by Antoine Fuqua, the last time he teamed up with Washington the star won a best actor Oscar for his role in 2001's Training Day. Manglehorn Al Pacino also appears in two films at the festival. Manglehorn sees him play a small town locksmith who was left heartbroken 40 years before and never got over losing the woman of his dreams. Pacino's second film is The Humbling, based on Philip Roth's final novel, with the Oscar winner starring as a legendary stage actor who has an affair with a woman half his age. The festival runs 4 - 14 September.",The Toronto International Film Festival is set to kick off on Thursday - one of the largest and most prestigious events in the annual film festival calendar.
"MacFarlane, who voices slow-witted dad Peter Griffin and baby Stewie on the cult animated show, will appear at the Royal Albert Hall on 27 August. The writer and actor will perform with the John Wilson Orchestra, ahead of his debut album release later this year. The album features MacFarlane fronting a host of big band tunes. MacFarlane's hit show frequently features subversive song and dance numbers, which pay tribute to the era of Hollywood musicals. Family Guy, which is due to enter its 11th series in the autumn, follows the dysfunctional Griffin family, their friends and neighbours. It features the voices of actors Seth Green and Mila Kunis. MacFarlane, whose other cartoon shows include American Dad and The Cleveland Show - a spin off of Family Guy, is currently working on a revamped version of the 1960s cartoon The Flintstones. He has also starred and directed in his first live-action film Ted, which co-stars Mark Wahlberg.","Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane is taking part in this year's BBC Proms, in a show which pays tribute to Broadway musicals."
"By Neil SmithEntertainment reporter On Thursday, Colvin's death in 2012 was deemed an ""extrajudicial killing"" by US District Judge Amy Berman Jackson, who ordered President Bashar al-Assad's government to pay $302.5m (£231m) in damages. Colvin died in the besieged Syrian city of Homs alongside French photographer Remi Ochlik when the building they were in was shelled. It was an ""unconscionable crime"", according to the judge. And it features in A Private War, in which British actress Rosamund Pike plays the formidable Sunday Times correspondent. Pike was in London promoting the film when the results of the civil legal case, filed by Colvin's family in 2016, were made public. The Gone Girl actress said the ""astonishing"" verdict was ""a resounding declaration"" that the Assad regime was ""guilty on all counts"". She told ITV News: ""What Marie was saying was powerful enough that the leaders of a powerful regime felt the need to kill her for it."" Colvin's family is likely to face a lengthy battle to recover any damages from the Syrian government, which was not involved in defending the case. Colvin's fate inevitably features in A Private War, which also depicts her previous reporting in Iraq, Sri Lanka, Libya and Afghanistan. In the film, Pike wears the black eye patch that became Colvin's trademark for the last 11 years of her life. The correspondent began wearing it after losing the sight in her left eye when she was struck by shrapnel from an RPG (rocket-propelled grenade) while reporting on the humanitarian crisis in Sri Lanka in 2001. Pike, whose other films include A United Kingdom and Die Another Day, says she was drawn to play Colvin because she ""doesn't fit any stereotype of a woman on screen"". She tells the BBC: ""I thought, if the right film-maker gets this subject, the world is going to be excited to meet this fierce, complicated, extraordinary woman."" The film-maker in question is Matthew Heineman, director of such acclaimed documentaries as Cartel Land (2015) and City of Ghosts (2017). Pike admits some trepidation about playing the lead, not least because she is 16 years younger than Colvin was at the time of her death. ""I definitely met with anxiety from people who knew her, many of whom did not want a film made,"" says the actress, who turned 40 last weekend. ""But I stressed from the start that my only interest in doing this was to put an embodiment of Marie on screen her friends and family could recognise. ""I just wanted to disappear really - to shed my own skin and be her. That was my sole aim."" Pike's disappearing act involved altering her posture, gesturing differently and emulating Colvin's penchant for smoking up to 50 cigarettes a day. ""I had to embrace that with a passion,"" she explains. ""I had to go with the attitude that everything would be better with a cigarette."" And then there was the aforementioned eye patch, the donning of which made Pike admire Colvin's fortitude under fire even more. ""You've lost a significant amount of your peripheral vision and your ability to perceive depth,"" she marvels. ""It was a huge disadvantage to her."" Shooting A Private War in Jordan saw Pike pretend to run through sniper and mortar fire, scenes that left her ""doubly in awe of what she did"". ""You never feel in danger, but you can imagine how it might feel if it was real and how absolutely terrifying it would be,"" she elaborates. Colvin's fateful final assignment has already inspired a film documentary, Under the Wire, which will be shown on BBC Four on 11 February. A biography, written by her colleague Lindsey Hilsum, was published last year, while the article on which A Private War was based can be found on the Vanity Fair website. For all that, Pike believes drama can still have a role in bringing Colvin's story and the plights of the people she wrote about to a wider audience. ""To a younger audience who are not familiar with her at all, I think she can be a heroine or role model,"" the actress says. ""She's somebody truly admirable to get behind and then go and discover."" A Private War can be seen in UK cinemas on 4 February in a one night only event screening followed by a cast Q&A. It will go on general release on 15 February. Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

It features objects recovered from the ruins of Pompeii and Herculaneum, both wiped out by Mount Vesuvius in 79AD. The exhibition, Life and Death in Pompeii and Herculaneum, closes on 29 September. It received five-star reviews from critics in March - with the Daily Telegraph noting ""the quality of much of what has come to London beggars belief"".

"His most recent was broadcast just last week, as the voice of the Hitchhikers' Guide to the Galaxy Mark II - a powerful being known on our planet as Prof Hawking. ""I have been quite popular in my time,"" the character says in the BBC Radio 4 adaptation. ""Some even read my books."" It's that self-deprecating humour that characterised Prof Hawking's appearances. Here's a brief look at some of them. The Simpsons Prof Hawking once commented that ""almost as many people know me through The Simpsons as through my science"". Whether that's true is debatable - but his stints on the long-running cartoon have been among his most memorable guest appearances. He first appeared in 1999 episode They Saved Lisa's Brain, with his wheelchair loaded with gadgets. He not only knocks out Principal Skinner, using a boxing glove on a spring, but then flies off with the help of helicopter blades, saving Lisa Simpson from a collapsing bandstand in the process. He also tells Homer his doughnut-shaped universe theory is ""intriguing"" - and that he may steal it. ""I hope I wouldn't use the boxing glove - though sometimes I am sorely tempted,"" he said. ""But helicopter blades would be very useful."" His cartoon self came about as his daughter Lucy knew one of the scriptwriters. ""The episode was very funny,"" he added. Little Britain for Comic Relief Prof Hawking had the mother of all wheelchair adaptations when it allowed him to become a transformer-type machine in a Little Britain sketch for Comic Relief. He's seen being pushed through the grounds of a college at the University of Cambridge by Lou Todd - usually seen with wheelchair user Andy Pipkin. When Prof Hawking gets fed up with Lou's patronising chat (about Peppa Pig, among other things), he says: ""Professor Stephen Hawking bot, transform"". He blasts Catherine Tate (playing an equally patronising nun) with a ray gun before chasing after Lou and turning the gun on him, before leaving the scene with a ""ha ha ha"". The Big Bang Theory Sheldon gets to hand over his paper on the Higgs boson to his idol in The Hawking Excitation - which has also seen Howard working on Prof Hawking's wheelchair when he comes to their university to lecture. When Sheldon meets Prof Hawking, he tells him it's an ""honour and a privilege"" to meet him - to which Prof Hawking replies: ""I know."" He then goes on to tell Sheldon he's made a mistake in one of his calculations, causing Sheldon to faint. ""Great, another fainter,"" he says. In another episode, The Extract Obliteration, he appears making a phone call to Sheldon - having played a game of Words With Friends online with him. He calls Sheldon ""Dr Loser"" instead of Dr Cooper and asks: ""What does Sheldon Cooper and a black hole have in common? They both suck."" Comic Relief originals The ""renowned scientist and occasional sitcom star"" is seen auditioning celebrities all hoping to provide his new voice in another clip for Comic Relief. Prof Hawking listens to pleas from stars including Liam Neeson, Rebel Wilson, Lin-Manuel Miranda and Kylie Minogue as they all seek to persuade him to use their vocal talents. ""No, not a chance"" he tells Simon Cowell, before slightly swearily telling Gordon Ramsay: ""I don't think anyone would take me (beeped out) seriously if I sounded like that."" Star Wars' John Boyega gets a slightly better reaction, with Prof Hawking saying: ""Wowsers."" But he's not the one to ultimately get the gig, as the clip above shows... Monty Python - The Meaning of Live Prof Hawking pre-recorded a clip with Brian Cox for Monty Python's 2014 live reunion shows - in which he's seen running over his fellow physicist as he's explaining the expansion of the universe. ""I think you're being pedantic,"" he tells Prof Cox as he knocks him over (well, or a stunt double does), before launching into a version of Monty Python's The Galaxy Song. Star Trek: The Next Generation In an episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation, he appeared as a hologram playing cards with Sir Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein. When Sir Isaac pompously started to explain how he discovered gravity, Hawking protested: ""Not the apple story again."" Off camera, as he was being shown the USS Enterprise's warp drive, he reportedly quipped: ""I'm working on that."" Futurama In TV animation Futurama, the perennially dim Phillip J Fry asked Prof Hawking: ""Aren't you that physicist that invented gravity?''. The scientist, playing himself, replied: ""Sure. Why not?"" He appeared in a total of three episodes of the animated series. Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

"By Mark SavageBBC music reporter The star was distressed and upset. She wanted to play a medley of her hits at Sunday's American Music Awards but her old record label had forbidden it. Or so she claimed. The label hit back with a statement of its own, saying it hadn't tried to stop the show and that Swift's narrative ""does not exist"". Insults were traded, politicians weighed in and, eventually, a settlement was reached. Big Machine Records issued a statement on Monday night saying it had agreed ""to grant all licences of their artists' performances"" for ""the upcoming American Music Awards"". It didn't mention Swift by name but the implication was clear: Her performance could go ahead. But the second half of the statement was the really interesting part. ""It should be noted,"" said the label, ""that recording artists do not need label approval for live performances on television or any other live media. ""Record label approval is only needed for contracted artists' audio and visual recordings and in determining how those works are distributed."" In other words, Swift never needed permission to play hits like Shake It Off, Love Story or I Knew You Were Trouble at the AMAs (in any case, performance rights belong to the publisher, not the record label). What she couldn't do was put them online afterwards. And that matters. Last year, 6.5 million viewers tuned in watch the AMAs on television, down from 9.15 million a year earlier, but clips from the show went viral. Cardi B's carnivalesque performance of I Like It has racked up 28m views on YouTube alone, for example - making that platform more valuable to her as an artist than the TV broadcast itself. Taylor Swift obviously wants her performance archived online, too... but that's where things get tricky. ""If Taylor was performing her own songs live at a festival, which wasn't being broadcast, it wouldn't be a problem,"" leading music and entertainment lawyer Talya Shalson tells the BBC. ""The issue in this situation is that, as it's a recorded performance, that would effectively be a re-recording"" of the star's biggest hits. ""It's very common for labels to put in a re-recording restriction, which normally lasts three or five years after the end of the artist's deal,"" she explains. Such a clause prevents the artist from taking their songs, recording them again and delivering them to another label, allowing the original rights-holder to ""protect its investments"". A crucial bit of background to this story: Swift fell out with Big Machine in June this year, after the label was bought by Justin Bieber and Ariana Grande's manager Scooter Braun for $300 million. Swift made no secret of her dismay. One of Braun's on-and-off clients is Kanye West, who has tormented Swift for more than a decade, interrupting her at award shows, disparaging her in his songs and putting a waxwork of her naked body into a music video. Swift believes Braun encouraged and endorsed some of those actions, which is why she issued an impassioned statement this summer, saying she felt ""sad and grossed out"" by Braun taking control of her back catalogue, including every album she released up to 2017's Reputation. She called the deal ""my worst case scenario"" that ""stripped me of my life's work""; but later announced plans to re-record all of her old music, undercutting the value of the master tapes held by Braun and his investment company Ithaca Holdings. Speaking to Good Morning America over the summer, she revealed the process would begin next year. ""My contract says that starting November 2020, I can record albums one through five all over again,"" she said. ""I think it's important for artists to own their work,"" she continued. ""I'm gonna be busy, I'm very excited."" (Coincidentally, she played Shake It Off during the same TV appearance, apparently without any restrictions from Big Machine.) Swift wouldn't be the first artist to record ""forgeries"" of their biggest hits: TLC, Prince and Def Leppard have all used the tactic to regain control of their music. But her plans apparently spurred last week's tussle. In her initial statement, Swift said she'd been told the AMA medley could go ahead if she ""agreed not to record copycat versions of my songs next year"". As leverage, Big Machine seemed willing to classify any archive of the performance as a ""new master recording"", putting Swift in breach of her contract. But that is a ""technical argument"" which ""to my knowledge, is not a position that a label has taken before,"" says music industry lawyer Susan Genco. She describes Big Machine's original stance as ""counter-intuitive and against the label's interest"" because, if millions of people see Swift play on Sunday, they're likely to go out and stream her back catalogue, boosting the label's profits. In that light, the decision to halt the performance seems misguided at best; vindictive at worst. It's an ugly story, and one that's as old as the music industry itself: A young artist signs a restrictive contract at the start of their career, and only becomes aware of the consequences when it's too late. In this case, Swift was able to mobilise her fans, who paid to erect #IStandWithTaylor billboards outside Big Machine's offices in Nashville; and the media, who covered the fall-out in blow-by-blow detail, until she got the outcome she wanted (although a planned Netflix documentary is still in dispute). As an added bonus, a lot more people now know that Swift is performing at the American Music Awards this weekend, where she is due to receive the Artist Of The Decade award.

"The show will open in Southampton in October next year and tour across the UK and Ireland, before closing at London's Hammersmith Apollo. The production, which scooped two Tony Awards, features Green Day's music. ""We can't wait for our friends across the pond to see the musical,"" frontman Billie Joe Armstrong said. The production features the hit songs Boulevard of Broken Dreams, 21 Guns, Wake Me Up When September Ends, and the title track, American Idiot, from the band's Grammy Award-winning album. ""We're excited to be bringing the US stage production of American Idiot to the UK and Ireland,"" said Armstrong. ""We played to some of the most insane crowds when we toured the album there."" The show's producers are hoping that the UK adaptation of the show will eventually transfer to the West End. In 2010, the Broadway show scooped the Tony Awards for best scenic design of a musical and best lighting design. It was also named the winner of the best musical show album at the Grammys earlier this year. The production opened at California's Berkeley Repertory Theatre in 2009, before moving to Broadway, where it remained for a year. Reviews were positive with Charles Isherwood, from The New York Times, calling the musical ""thrilling"" and The Stage's Mark Shenton describing it as ""probably the most most compelling new musical of the Broadway season"". Tickets for the UK tour are due to go on sale on 9 December.","The award-winning production of Green Day's musical American Idiot, which played on Broadway more than a year, is to tour the UK."
"By Mark SavageBBC Music reporter Did you spot the misplaced apostrophe? If you didn't, don't worry, you're in good company: Taylor Swift has been named and shamed on social media for mis-punctuating one of her T-shirts. Quoting the lyrics to her new song, ME!, the shirt declares: ""Your'e the only one of you."" Swift's mistake is all the more delicious because, elsewhere on the single, she sings: ""Hey kids, spelling is fun!"" (Fun fact: Swift once won her elementary school's spelling bee contest.) But she's not the first pop star to slip up on the icy path of good grammar. Last year, Cheryl made a similar punctuation error on a hoodie featuring lyrics from her single Love Made Me Do It (""it was'nt my fault""), while One Direction sold T-shirts for their 2012 Australian tour listing a concert on ""21th June"". Justin Bieber also recalled a garment for his 2016 Purpose tour after fans pointed out he'd invented the new word ""purose"". Mistakes are ""not common but not unprecedented,"" says Henry Oliver, editor of New Zealand's Metro magazine and co-author of The Art Of The Band T-Shirt. ""Getting the names of cities wrong is the most common mistake - but once you've left for tour, and you've got boxes of T-shirts, the error seems to stick."" There's a reluctance to scrap mis-printed merchandise because of the cost involved. A run of 1,000 T-shirts costs about £2,500; and major artists will print many more for a world tour. Billion-dollar business Added to which, ""there's been a general shift towards merchandise as a revenue generator since the decline of record sales over the last 15, 20 years,"" says Oliver. According to the Licensing International, the global music merchandise market was worth $3.5 billion (£2.75 billion) in 2018, up from $2.3 billion (£1.8 billion) four years ago. To put that in perspective, revenue from live music concerts worldwide last year was $5.65 billion (£4.44 billion); while the global market for recorded music was worth $19.1 billion (£15.04 billion), according to the IFPI. So merchandise is a vital source of income - and artists are finding new ways to exploit its potential. ""Over the last five years, there's been a new emphasis band merchandise as street wear and fashion,"" says Oliver. ""So, for example, Harry Styles came to play recently in Auckland, and there was the opportunity to go and buy merchandise the day before the show. ""That seems to be an increasingly regular occurrence, whereby artists will come and have pop-up shops that will almost be selling a clothing line. It's more akin to fashion than traditional concert merchandise."" Kanye West, who takes fashion as seriously as music, helped pioneer the trend, launching his Yeezy collections with lavish shows at New York Fashion Week. Notably, his designs sell at much higher prices than the average £20 tour T-shirt, a trend that's been followed by Justin Bieber and David Bowie - whose Paul Smith-designed Blackstar shirts went for £65 each. Taylor Swift charges more fan-friendly prices for her merchandise - but that wandering apostrophe could bump up the cost of her tour Ts for collectors. Misprints and mistakes are particularly interesting to ""hyper-completists"", says Brent Greissle, the discography specialist at music trading website Discogs.com. People will pay high prices for a rare pressing The Beatles' 1970 compilation album Hey Jude, where song titles are erroneously listed as ""Paper Back Writer"" and ""Revolutions"" (instead of Paperback Writer and Revolution, respectively). Collectors will also pay upwards of £500 for a vinyl pressing of Rubber Soul where the label lists the geographically-challenged Lennon-McCartney composition ""Norweigian Wood"". ""Especially with those examples, it's something of a big price difference for incredibly minor things like slight spelling errors,"" says Greissle - whose favourite mis-prints are on bootleg records like ""Sexperience The Hendrix"" and the timeless ""Best Of Eric Crapton"". He says fans of artists like the Beatles, David Bowie, Led Zeppelin and U2 are more likely to seek out these rarities - but ""for the most part, the difference between an error copy and a regular copy may be negligible at best. ""Rest assured, the number of people who would care about a typo on an Andy Williams or Mantovani pop record are far less than the supply."" Fans have indicated that only a handful of Taylor Swift's already limited-edition T-shirts contained the grammatical error, in which case, ""she has definitely created something very sought-after,"" says Oliver. ""You could imagine a situation where these are selling for hundreds of pounds on eBay."" And he argues the star could turn the error into an opportunity. ""We're in an era where, unless you're talking about political mis-statements, any mistake can be owned in a way that gives it ironic value to your fanbase. ""So for someone like Taylor Swift, who is so good at internalising and capitalising on critiques of herself, there's almost no mistake she couldn't turn to her own advantage. ""Let's say next week there was a news story whereby some fan had paid a ridiculous amount of money for one of those T-shirts. My natural inclination would be to be cynical about that story,"" he says, suggesting Swift's team could turn the misprint into a marketing opportunity. In many ways, that's already happened: People are Instagramming and Tweeting (and writing news stories, natch) about a garment that otherwise would have been noticed only by hardcore Swifties.

"The theatre company is sponsored by BP, which has been criticised by environmentalists including Oscar winner Sir Mark Rylance. The students have sent a letter to the RSC claiming the British multinational oil and gas company is ""destroying our futures by wrecking the climate"". They want the RSC to break its ties with the fossil fuel industry. Rylance resigned from the company over its association with the fossil fuel company in June, in order to ""lend strength"" to progressive voices in the organisation. Now strikers from the birthplace of the Bard, in Stratford-upon-Avon, have signed the letter calling for an end to the current sponsorship, which provides young people with subsidised £5 tickets. They've called for a boycott unless what they believe is environmental destruction is separated from the world of theatre, and have also asked to meet with RSC bosses. The letter criticises BP for its environmental impact, lobbying and human rights record. 'Wrecking the climate' It states: ""If we, as young people, wish to see an affordable play at your theatre, we have to help to promote a company that is actively destroying our futures by wrecking the climate. ""BP is jeopardising the futures of these young people they apparently care so much about, by continuing to extract huge quantities of oil and gas, and actively lobbying against the climate change policies that we school strikers are pushing so hard for."" Adding: ""Furthermore, BP's human rights record is an embarrassment. Their close relationship with repressive governments and regimes such as Egypt, Mexico and Russia has led to horrendous human rights violations. ""It is sickening that the works of Shakespeare are being associated with these events."" The letter concludes: ""BP's influence is nothing but a stain on the RSC."" Catherine Mallyon, RSC executive director and Gregory Doran, RSC artistic director said: ""We welcome the conversation around this issue and will respond once we receive the letter. 'Displeasure' ""We recognise the importance for a continuing, robust and engaged debate, we acknowledge the climate emergency and recognise the strength of feeling, especially amongst our young people. ""Our work with over 500,000 students annually means their feedback and opinions are very important to us."" More than 60,000 people signed a recent petition for cultural institutions - the British Museum, National Portrait Gallery and Royal Opera House - to end their financial ties with the BP, and climate activists To BP Or Not BP have campaigned against fossil fuel funding going into the arts. ""As a pupil of the school that Shakespeare attended himself, I cannot begin to explain my displeasure in learning about BP's recent sponsorship of the RSC's 16-25 tickets,"" said 16-year-old Stratford-upon-Avon student Chloe Hawryluk. ""If I want to attend the theatre, I want to attend the theatre without supporting a company that is continuing to extract fossil fuels."" She added: ""I don't want to support a company that is one of the world's biggest emitters of greenhouse gases, I don't want to support a company that is only doing this to distract us from the fact that they are ruining our planet."" 'Reducing emissions' In response BP said they have been supporting the arts in the UK for more than 50 years and that their support allows the institutions they partner ""to widen access and extend the reach of their productions and exhibitions"". They stressed their working relationship with the RSC dates back to 2011 and claim ""to have helped around 10,000 young people benefit from reduced-price access to its world-class productions"". ""Our position on climate is clear - the world is on an unsustainable path and needs to move to net-zero carbon emissions in the decades to come,"" said a spokesperson.

"It's easy to get distracted by her celebrity, but Taylor Swift is a once-in-a-generation songwriter. From the very beginning, she's displayed a knack for melody and storytelling that most artists never master. Take, for example, her first US number one, Our Song. Written for a high school talent show, it's a fairly typical tale of teenage romance until the final lines: ""I grabbed a pen / And an old napkin / And I wrote down our song."" That's smart, self-assured songwriting for someone who wasn't old enough to vote. Notably, the lyrics insert the musician directly into the narrative - something she developed into a tried and tested trope. But Our Song also establishes another of Taylor's trademarks: The one-note melody. These static vocal lines, where she sings at one pitch for a sustained period, crop up on all of her her albums - and increase in frequency when she switches lanes from country to pop. You can hear it on all four songs she's released ahead of her new record, Reputation, which comes out this Friday. It's most apparent on the lead single, Look What You Made Me Do, where the entire chorus is delivered in a sinister monotone. But it's less of a cop-out than you might think, and here's why. Taylor Swift's career is built on being accessible. She might have 10 Grammy awards, but she recently invited loyal fans to an album playback at her oceanfront mansion in Rhode Island. In 2008, when she was 18 years old, she accompanied another fan, Whit Wright, to his prom in Alabama. She regularly delivers handwritten notes and gift packages to her Instagram followers. Repetitive melodies that centre around a single note are part of that appeal. They emphasise her relatability by mimicking the cadence of speech. It helps that her lyrics are effortlessly conversational and vernacular. ""We are never, ever getting back together"" is a clumsy song title but it makes perfect sense in Taylor's brand of teen-speak. The impression is that you're hanging out with a friend, chatting about boys (and it's almost always about boys). Taylor uses the device most often in verses, shifting the chords beneath her voice to give the melody a sense of movement, in the same way that moving a light around the room casts different shadows. When the chorus soars up the musical scale, it's like a rush of energy. The emotional highs become even higher. And, as I am not the first to point out, she has a flair for melodrama. Taylor didn't invent these one-note melodies, of course. Gregorian chant, one of the earliest recorded forms of Western music, was predominantly monotone. ""A lot of that had to do with understanding the text - because this is religious text and they want people to understand the words that they're singing,"" said musicologist Scott Interrante in a podcast on the phenomenon of one-note melodies. ""That's important to think about in our modern pop songs,"" he added. ""It might have a lot to do with the words"". Let's scrub out the word ""might"". Taylor really, really wants us to pay attention to her lyrics. ""I wouldn't be a singer if I weren't a songwriter,"" she told Billboard in 2014. ""I have no interest in singing someone else's words."" If you believe the tabloids, she spends most of her time warbling about famous ex-boyfriends and feuds with fellow pop stars - but if you pay attention, Swift's catalogue is full of deft lyrical minutiae. In fact, she has the rare ability to tell a whole story in the space of a sentence: That last one is particularly interesting. The car accident was real, and Taylor sings the (one-note) melody with uncommon urgency over a turbulent backing track. ""I put it in the song knowing it was an evocative lyric,"" she told NPR in 2014. ""And it was almost like this very strange, subtle clue to the media that they don't know everything that happened in that relationship, and they don't know everything that happens in my life, and I can have something really major and traumatic happen to me and they don't know about it."" On this year's Look What You Made Me Do, she uses the one-note melody in another way - to convey anger and defiance. The target here is Kanye West, who stage-crashed her acceptance speech at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards and has dogged her career ever since. ""I don't like your little games,"" she spits, ""The role you made me play / Of the fool / No, I don't like you."" Her delivery is clipped and defensive. The conversational tone is replaced by a threat. (Incidentally, that's probably why the song took such a battering in the media: Bitter Taylor isn't as appealing as unlucky-in-love-but-shaking-it-off Taylor.) Another of Taylor's key traits is to shout key lines for emphasis: ""We never go OUT OF STYLE""; ""Are we in the clear yet, IN THE CLEAR YET? GOOD!""; ""All you had to do was STAY (STAY) STAY (STAY)"". Again, she's using rhetorical tricks to drive home her point - and by doing so, she's taking her place in the pop pantheon. Songwriters like John Lennon and Morrissey, who place equal emphasis on their lyrics, also tend to utilise one-note melodies. And then there's rap, whose rhythmic ebb and flow exerts an increasingly strong gravitational pull on pop writers. In fact, static melodies are cropping up all over the place, on Dua Lipa's New Rules, Post Malone's Rockstar, and Khalid's Young Dumb & Broke. None of this is to suggest that Taylor is incapable of writing a melody. Of her new tracks, the love song Gorgeous is both the most heartfelt and the most traditionally ""songy"". But her masterpiece is a song called Ronan - a little-known charity single, released in 2012. It was written about Ronan Thompson, a four-year-old boy who died of a rare form of cancer. After reading a blog written by the boy's mother, Maya Thompson, Taylor turned her words into a song: ""I remember your bare feet, down the hallway / I remember your little laugh / Race cars on the kitchen floor, plastic dinosaurs / I love you to the moon and back."" In other hands, it could have been saccharine and exploitative. It isn't. Taylor's delicate delivery, and the sorrowful contours of her melody are simply devastating. If you ever had any doubts, Ronan settles it: Taylor Swift is anything but a one-note pop star. Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

"His comments came as the BBC published for the first time the pay of stars earning £150,000 and more. The figures reveal that about two-thirds of stars earning more than £150,000 are male, compared to one-third female, according to the BBC annual report. The top seven earners in the list of the BBC's 96 best-paid stars are all male. What is the gender pay gap? The pay gap is the percentage difference between average hourly earnings for men and women. Across the UK men earned 18.1% more than women in April 2016 according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This figure is calculated on a 1% sample of employees' jobs. It takes the median for men and women, which is the level of pay that half of people earn more than and half earn less than. The pay gap isn't the same as equal pay. Equal pay - that men and women doing the same job should be paid the same - has been a legal requirement for 47 years. As the following graph shows, the gap between men and women's earning for both full and part-time work has fallen from 27.5% in 1997 to 18.1% in 2016. If you only look at full-time workers the pay gap drops to 9.4%. For part-time workers the pay gap favours women, who now earn 6% more than men. BBC figures The numbers do not tell the whole story. The list does not distinguish between people who are paid for doing multiple jobs within the BBC and those who are paid for just one. The figures only include what the BBC pays its talent directly. So if a presenter is paid by an independent production company or by the BBC's commercial arm, this is not included. Tony Hall's claim Questioned by Mishal Husain on Radio 4's Today programme, director general Lord Hall said that, compared with an 18% gap in pay between genders across the UK, the BBC pay gap across the corporation was 10%, which will be audited in the autumn. The BBC press office said that covered full and part-time employees. Reality Check asked for the part-time figures but the press office said that was all it had in terms of breakdown at the moment. Gender pay gap in the workforce The ONS provides some pay gap data for groups of occupations based on their annual earnings survey. The following graph shows the gender pay gap by major occupation groups. According to ONS definitions, elementary occupations require ""a minimum general level of education"". This category includes farm and postal workers, cleaners and security guards. Skilled trades include jobs requiring a ""substantial period of training"", such as landscape gardeners, vehicle mechanics and TV engineers. Associate professionals and technical occupations include jobs such as civil engineers technicians, paramedics and youth workers. It is possible to look at jobs within these broad groups. For instance, the pay gap for the category ""journalists, newspaper and periodical editors"", which includes broadcast journalists, is 7.1%. Likewise, for ""artistic, media and literary occupations"", which includes presenters, actors, producers and directors but also professions such as dancers and choreographers, the gap is just 2.7%. Another way to look at the pay gap is by industry sector rather than by occupation. This shows that for the programming and broadcasting sector, looking at employees' hourly pay, the gender pay gap is 9.4%. The 10% figure quoted by Lord Hall covers everyone employed by the BBC, so will include a wide range of jobs including technical staff, journalists, human resources and marketing. By April 2018, all companies with 250 or more employees will have to publish figures showing average pay for men and women including any bonuses. This will reveal how widespread the gender pay gap is and will enable comparisons with other companies. Meanwhile, Lord Hall has made a commitment to closing the pay gap in the BBC altogether. ""I have said that by 2020 we will have equality between men and women on air and we will have the pay gap sorted out.""

"By Kash JonesEntertainment reporter Whether it's with pranks, sketches or jokes, making your audience laugh is one of the easiest ways to go viral. But can traditional stand-up comedy survive in the new comedy climate? There are several pitfalls comedians can fall into, in the online era, as the BBC's comedy controller Shane Allen pointed out last week. ""For social media you can have three tweets will lead to a storm... there's people who are a lot more willing to take offence easily because they'll take material out of context,"" he told BBC News. ""People sometimes confuse the subject of a joke with the target of a joke. So anything around race or sex is accused of being racist or sexist, so a handful of comments and opinions can quickly become quite a storm and damaging so I would like the comedy community to be able to represent ourselves a bit more."" Allen added he actively advises comedians to stay off Twitter once a TV show has been commissioned, to avoid the likelihood of being caught up in any scandals. 'Great opportunity' But while there are plenty of potential pitfalls, there are also plenty of benefits to comedians being on Twitter. Many use it as their main platform to build a profile. Amelia Dimoldenberg, also known as ""the girl from the chicken shop"", set up a spoof dating show where she interviews grime artists and influencers in fried chicken shops across London. Through social media, she built up traction and meme accounts, such as YoungKingsTV, Warmzn and ImJustBait, helped by advertising short versions of her YouTube videos on their pages. But Amelia, who has over 160,000 subscribers on her YouTube channel, doesn't believe that traditional live stand-up comedy is obsolete just yet. She tells BBC News: ""I think that the online world of comedy has just created a different way to consume it rather than replacing traditional set-ups. ""I do think that if you want to be hyper successful in today's landscape you must master them both."" Amelia uses Mo Gilligan, also known as Mo The Comedian, as an example. Gilligan co-hosts Channel 4's The Big Narstie Show and tours regularly, but also has countless viral social media videos, and has sold out tours across the country with his a Coupla Cans comedy nights. He started out by uploading clips while still working in a clothes store in London (customers even began to recognise him). According to Amelia, digital platforms have birthed a new area for comedy to be displayed, which should be welcomed. Yomi Sontan, known online as Yoms TV, uses Instagram as his main platform to showcase his comedy. He has more than 130,000 followers and generally accumulates around 60,000 views per post. He believes the respect for traditional comedy, such as stand up in the UK, is declining. Speaking about TV comedy programmes, he said: ""We see the same old shows like Mock The Week and Live at the Apollo. ""The way audiences watch comedy has evolved, there's no longer a set time on TV, they can watch it when they want through tablets and other devices."" Comedian Kojo landed the coveted golden buzzer from Simon Cowell on Britain's Got Talent earlier this month. He's also travelled all around Europe and Africa with his stand-up comedy. He has also introduced London's first black comedy club, Da Comedy Fun House, which has been graced by the likes of US comedy heavyweights Dave Chapelle and Kevin Hart. According to Kojo, social media is a great way to build up a following, but he adds that stand-up comedians should be worried about the rise of the online comedian. ""Unlike music or a movie, you only laugh at the joke once and it gets lighter and lighter and lighter till it's not funny anymore,"" he explains. Kojo adds comedy audiences on social media and at live gigs are after very different things. ""It's all 90 seconds long online, whereas with live stand up there's a bit more story telling,"" he says. ""It's more slow place with a genuine interaction - it's very easy to re-shoot it for social media. But when it's live it either works or it doesn't."" Aaron Brown, the owner and editor of the British Comedy Guide says social media ""offers comedians a great opportunity for wide exposure"". ""It's a chance to find and grow a fan-base potentially very quickly, as well as for promotion and where fans can see them, whether that's a stand-up tour, an existing DVD release, a TV appearance, a podcast or any one of a number of other activities."" He adds it offers fans a great opportunity to re-promote comics' material, with organic recommendations and benefits. New and upcoming comics can use social media as a tool to find work, as well as sharing stories and boosting their morale chatting with colleagues. There are certainly risks, as Allen argued last week, that given the immediacy of the platform, comedians find themselves at increased risk of being at the centre of a scandal. But while it's a tricky minefield for the industry, it's one from which huge rewards can be reaped if used carefully and wisely.

The cast includes Emily Watson, David Thewlis, Benedict Cumberbatch (currently in TV's Sherlock), Peter Mullan and Jeremy Irvine. The book tells the story of a farm horse, Joey, who gets separated from his owner and ends up in the trenches of World War I. What's astonishing is that War Horse made it this far at all. Morpurgo, who wrote the book in 1982, admits it did nothing spectacular for years. ""It nearly won a prize but failed. It was translated into three or four languages. It was published in America and didn't succeed. It stayed in print - just about - for about 25 years. It simply was not a book that anyone really knew about or cared about."" 'Spellbinding' Spielberg All that changed when it came to the attention of the National Theatre, which was on the look-out for an animal-centric drama. The show opened in 2007 to widespread acclaim. And then Hollywood came knocking on the stable door. ""The Spielberg thing was extraordinary,"" says Morpurgo. ""It worked unbelievably quickly. The deal was done within weeks and the film is going to be made within months."" Morpurgo met Spielberg to discuss the project, and has been kept in the loop as the screenplay (by Lee Hall and Richard Curtis) has developed. ""Steven Spielberg was wonderfully engaging and inquisitive about the whole history of it,"" Morpurgo recalls. ""It was the most spellbinding thing to sit across the table from one of the world's great storytellers."" The 66-year-old author has high hopes for the big screen War Horse: ""I'd like it to be the iconic movie of World War I since All Quiet on the Western Front or Oh! What a Lovely War."" Has Morpurgo been surprised by the novel's slow-burning success? ""Am I little surprised?"" he answers, with a hint of disbelief at the question. ""Yes, I'm a little surprised, but I'm also relatively pleased."" Tractor tale The book Farm Boy is a ""sequel"" to War Horse in that it continues the story of Joey after World War I. Morpurgo, however, isn't fond of sequels: ""I don't like going back to to the same field to graze."" But he was persuaded to revisit Joey's story by the illustrator Michael Foreman - who suggested a story about how tractors changed the face of farming. ""I'd also had a few letters from kids asking what happened to Joey when he comes back from World War I? How did he manage back on the farm?"" More than 30 years ago Morpurgo and his wife Clare set up Farms for City Children in Devon, which gives children the opportunity to work with animals. ""I'm in the wonderful, privileged position of being able to witness this enthusiasm that urban people seem to have when they first come into the countryside,"" says Morpurgo. The stage version of Farm Boy - which opens in Edinburgh next week - is a more modest production than War Horse. ""If you went in with the expectations of the immense complexity of the lighting and design and amazing puppets of War Horse then you would be disappointed,"" says Morpurgo. ""This is a miniature portrait but it's beautifully crafted - all you have on stage is this wonderful old tractor and two people - they take several roles. It's how theatre should be done."" Morpurgo hasn't adapted these recent stage or screen versions of his books because after some earlier attempts he discovered he ""really wasn't very good at it"". But there is interest in the film rights to other books such as Private Peaceful (another story from World War I). And it would be surprising - as the 100th anniversary of the sinking of the Titanic approaches - if no-one wanted to make a version of Kaspar: Prince of Cats, the story of a cat at the Savoy Hotel who ends up on the doomed luxury liner. Both Private Peaceful and Kaspar contain powerful emotional punches that pull the rug from under readers of all ages. ""Life catches us out,"" admits Morpurgo. ""I know perfectly well as a father and grandfather that life is complicated and there are sadnesses and there are joys, and I reflect those in my stories. ""What I don't try to do is talk down to children and pretend that everything works out and it's all right. I think we must write about those things not in a way that is traumatic, but in a way that touches their hearts."" Farm Boy is on at the Edinburgh Suite, Assembly Rooms, Edinburgh, from 5 - 30 Aug prior to an autumn UK tour.","With Steven Spielberg about to film War Horse and a stage production of Farm Boy opening in Edinburgh, things are looking good for the author Michael Morpurgo."
"Fry will voice an aristocratic deer called Lord Stag in Driftwood Bay. The show, which will air on Nick Jr in the UK in May, is about a young girl who creates an imaginary world from treasures she finds on the beach. Horrocks will play Wee Rabbit while Mullan, best known for hard-hitting dramas, will be Salty Dog the sailor. Broadcaster, actor and presenter Fry is known as the host of BBC panel show QI and as The Hobbit's Master of Laketown while Mullan's credits include starring in TV drama Top of the Lake and the film Tyrannosaur. Mullan said: ""I've never done any voice work on animation so I thought this was a nice chance to do something that my children can actually see me in for a change!"" Driftwood Bay is to be made by Sixteen South, a Belfast-based children's TV production company. Horrocks was the star of stage play and film Little Voice and recently appeared alongside Mullan in the film Sunshine on Leith. The voice cast also includes Father Ted star Ardal O'Hanlon, Tameka Empson, who plays Kim Fox in EastEnders and Annette Crosbie, known for roles in TV shows like One Foot in the Grave and The Six Wives of Henry VIII.","Actors Stephen Fry, Peter Mullan and Jane Horrocks are to lend their voices to the characters in a new animated children's TV show."
"Viewers saw 12 singletons enter a new sun-drenched three-storey villa in South Africa for the ITV2 reality show. They also got their first glimpse of Laura Whitmore as host after she stepped in to replace Caroline Flack. The overnight ratings count live viewing and don't include catch-up. This is the first series to be screened outside the show's usual summer slot. For the launch of last summer's series, 3.3 million watched live. There will be another summer series later this year. Sunday's winter launch was watched by an average of 2.51 million viewers, according to the overnight ratings. Those viewers saw five men and seven women, including identical twins, enter the villa in Cape Town. The first residents include Rochelle Humes's sister Sophie, Lewis Capaldi's ex-girlfriend Paige and Manchester policeman Mike. As well as the new villa, one other big change was the new host. Flack had to step down last month after being charged with assault. Before the series got under way on Sunday, Flack sent Whitmore a good luck message. ""Massive good luck to Laura, Iain [Stirling] and the team for tonight's launch show..."" she wrote on Instagram. ""The first one always the best one."" Former contestant Megan Barton-Hanson told BBC Breakfast she thought Whitmore ""absolutely smashed it"". And the presenter got a broadly positive reception from fans on social media.

"Virtually all filming has been on hold since the lockdown began in March. The BBC said it would use ""strictly limited"" crews and stick to government guidelines when it resumes. BBC director of content Charlotte Moore said: ""We're also exploring ways to re-start filming on more dramas and other major BBC shows as soon as possible."" Writing in The Telegraph, she said the broadcaster wanted to ""help fire up the engines of British TV production - safely and sensibly"". She wrote: ""We've been looking very carefully at how we can safely put some of our shows back into production, and I'm pleased to announce that we plan to begin filming again on both EastEnders and Top Gear by the end of next month."" She continued: ""Cast members will do their own hair and make-up. Social distancing measures will be in place."" Episodes of EastEnders that were in the can before the pandemic have been rationed by BBC One. But when existing episodes run out, there is likely to be a gap before the new ones reach screens. Coronavirus is expected to be referenced as part of the storylines, although not in a prominent way. 'Creative and technical challenge' The corporation has been filming one drama series during lockdown. New versions of Alan Bennett's Talking Heads monologues are being made by skeleton crews on the EastEnders and Holby City sets, which is ""showing what's possible under Covid-19 restrictions"", Moore said. Friday's VE Day anniversary special from Buckingham Palace and the recent Hospital coronavirus specials ""are examples of how well we can rise to the creative and technical challenge"", she added. She did not say when other dramas like Line of Duty, Peaky Blinders and Call the Midwife - which all put filming on hold - are likely to return to set. She added that the BBC was ""determined to do everything we can"" to ""kick-start the TV industry and support our brilliant production sector nationwide"". Australian soap Neighbours has already returned, with reworked scripts and fewer characters in specific scenes. Some are being filmed in ""smaller components"" before being stitched together in the editing room, executive producer Jason Herbison told the Reuters news agency on Wednesday. In intimate scenes, a character might ""lean in for a kiss, and then the camera pans away and we hear a little bit of a giggle"", he said. ""It's just about re-imagining the scene differently, so you don't see that moment of impact."" Herbison said there would be no explicit references to coronavirus in the show, but viewers would see characters doing thing like sanitising their hands in restaurants. Other British soaps, such as ITV's Coronation Street and Emmerdale and Channel 4's Hollyoaks, have not yet announced how and when they expect to start filming again. Corrie producer Iain MacLeod did recently say the pandemic would feature in future episodes, but it won't ""dominate every single story"". Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

"Michael Egan, 31, alleges TV executives Garth Ancier, David Neuman and theatre producer Gary Goddard were part of an underage sex ring in Hollywood. Mr Ancier's lawyer said the claims were ""demonstrably untrue"", while Mr Neuman called them ""whole-cloth lies"". Earlier, a lawyer for Mr Goddard said the complaint was ""without merit"". In allegations similar to those filed against Singer, Mr Egan claims he was lured into a sex ring in 1999 by former entertainment executive Marc Collins-Rector, a registered sex offender, with promises of auditions for acting and modelling jobs. He alleges he was forced to have sex with adult men at ""infamous and degenerate parties"" in Hollywood and the abuse continued on trips to Hawaii, where he was inappropriately touched, made to consume alcohol and drugs, and forced into sex. He is claiming $10 million (£6 million) in damages for battery, assault, invasion of privacy and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The legal action was announced at a press conference in Los Angeles attended by Mr Egan and his mother. ""Somebody has to stand up to these people. You can't change the stigma that exists in this world against childhood sexual abuse unless someone talks about it,"" Mr Egan said. His mother, Bonnie Mound, said she tried to help her son contact police and the FBI to report the abuse 14 years ago and questioned why the information he provided did not result in criminal charges. ""It's not about money. It's about disarming these paedophiles who use their wealth and power to escape justice,"" she said. Alan Grodin, a lawyer for Mr Goddard - who has produced several Broadway shows and created attractions at Universal Studios - said the executive had not yet seen the legal claim. ""Based on what we have heard, the allegations are without merit,"" Grodin said. ""Once we have seen the complaint we will respond appropriately."" Mr Ancier oversaw the launch of Fox television and later worked as an executive producer for NBC and BBC America. He is credited with creating The Ricki Lake Show and 21 Jump Street. ""All of the allegations made by the plaintiff against Garth Ancier are demonstrably untrue, and we are confident the courts will agree when the evidence is presented,"" Ancier's lawyer, Louise Ann Fernandez, said. ""As just one of many examples, Mr Ancier has never even visited the estate in Hawaii where the plaintiff claims to have encountered him."" Mr Neuman, a former president of Walt Disney TV and chief programming officer at CNN, took to Twitter to denounce the charges as ""whole-cloth lies with zero basis in reality or truth"". He said it was ""sickening and very evil, for anyone to lie like that, let alone in a legal document"". Last week Mr Egan filed a legal claim against Singer, alleging the director forced him into sex during parties when Mr Egan was 17. In response to the claim, the FBI said it could not discuss specifically what Mr Egan told them, but denied it had ignored any information about the director. Singer's lawyer said the action was ""absurd and defamatory"". ""We are very confident that Bryan will be vindicated,"" Marty Singer, who is not related to his client, said. He added he would be ""bringing a claim for malicious prosecution"" against Mr Egan and his lawyer. Singer, 48, has directed three instalments of the X-Men franchise, including the upcoming X-Men: Days of Future Past - due to be released next month - and another instalment to be released in 2016. His other credits include The Usual Suspects, Superman Returns and last year's Jack the Giant Slayer.","A man who has claimed X-Men director Bryan Singer sexually abused him as a teenager has sued three more Hollywood figures, saying they molested him too."
"Pop mogul Louis Walsh is joined by Take That's Gary Barlow, singer Kelly Rowland and Tulisa Contostavlos of urban hip-hop band N-Dubz. There was no return for Cheryl Cole, who was axed last week from the American version of the show. Former judge Simon Cowell said: ""These four are totally up for it, each of them bring a different attitude."" Cowell added: ""They have had a ton of hits between them and they are all committed to finding a star. ""I have a feeling Louis and Tulisa will have slightly different points of view as to what the next star should look and sound like."" 'Fireworks' Barlow said: ""I'm extremely excited about working on The X Factor. I've always been a fan of the show and always enjoyed performing on it too. ""My one goal is to find a global superstar. If I don't find one, I won't have done my job."" N-Dubz star Tulisa said she looked forward to bringing ""something fresh"" to the panel. She added: ""I'm not going to be afraid to speak my mind and mix things up a little. ""I am hoping to find some hot new talent and mentor a winning category. It is also going to be great to get to know and work alongside the other judges. Let the fireworks begin."" Rowland added that she was thrilled to be heading to one of her ""favourite places in the world"". She said: ""The music coming out of the UK right now is incredible, with artists like Adele, Jessie J and James Blake, so I'm confident this season of The X Factor will give me opportunity to hear a few diamonds in the rough. ""Being a judge is never easy but I promise to be as sternly honest as I can and also encourage everyone who crosses the stage. I can't wait to meet the world's next superstar."" Walsh said: ""I'm delighted to be back for my eighth series of The X Factor, it's my favourite job in the world and I'm really excited this year to work with Gary Barlow and the rest of the new panel. ""I'm the last original judge standing and I'm determined to find an act that can win this year and show the others how it's done."" The first audition will be in Birmingham on Wednesday, then on to Glasgow, Manchester, Cardiff, London and Liverpool. In Monday night's Britain's Got Talent programme, Newcastle-born hosts Anthony McPartlin and Declan Donnelly teased Simon Cowell over Cole's exit from the US version of The X Factor. Rumours suggest part of the reason that Cole - who also hails from Newcastle - was axed due to her strong accent. Donnelly asked Cowell whether he could understand his Geordie accent. Cowell pretended not to understand, saying: ""Am I missing something here? I've just got back, what's been going on?""",The X Factor judging panel has been confirmed as three singers and a pop-music impresario.
"The former host of the show was found dead in her London flat last weekend. ""The past week has been extremely difficult, coming to terms with the loss of our friend and colleague, Caroline,"" presenter Laura Whitmore told viewers of the ITV2 programme. ""Caroline loved Love Island. She loved love, and that's why tonight's final is dedicated to her."" She added: ""We're thinking of her family and everyone who knew her at this time."" The programme then showed a montage of some of Flack's memorable moments from the series in recent years. The islanders were told about Flack's death off-camera on Saturday, an ITV spokesman confirmed. Finley Tapp and Paige Turley were crowned the winners of the series as the finale drew to a close. Two episodes of this series were pulled from the schedules last weekend after Flack was found dead. The show returned the following Monday with a tribute to Flack from the show's narrator Iain Stirling. This has been the first series of the show to take place in winter and be filmed in South Africa. Previous seasons have been filmed on the Spanish island of Mallorca over the summer. Overall, the winter series has been a ratings hit for ITV2, albeit not as successful as previous summer series. This series has been attracting around four million viewers per episode, including via catch-up services, compared with the six million the last summer series generally attracted. Laura Whitmore is the show's current presenter. She joined the show after Flack was charged with assaulting her boyfriend. Tapp and Turley were crowned the winners of this series on Sunday night, winning the £50,000 prize, which they chose to share between them. In a twist that occurs in every series, Turley was given the chance to ""steal"" the full prize money before she decided to split it evenly. ""It's been such an amazing experience,"" Turley said earlier in the episode. ""It's been filled with challenges, but it's been amazing."" Asked what first attracted him to Turley, Tapp said: ""I loved how outgoing she was. I wasn't wrong in picking her because I thought she'd make me laugh and smile all day long. She's made me very happy."" Earlier this series, they became the first pair to become an official couple in the villa. Turley attracted headlines when the series launched in January because she is the ex-girlfriend of singer Lewis Capaldi. The Scottish star referred to her while accepting the Brit Award for best single earlier this month, for his song Someone You Loved. ""A lot of people think this song is about my ex-girlfriend, who you can now see every night on Love Island,"" he said. ""But it's actually about my grandmother, who sadly passed away a few years ago. I hope ITV don't contact her to be a on a reality dating show.""

"Cherie Blair is among the donors who have come forward. Entrepreneur Martha Lane Fox and author Joanna Trollope are also helping to fund the £30,000 prize. Mobile company Orange announced in May it was ending its 17-year sponsorship of the prize, which recognises English language fiction written by women. Kate Mosse, the prize's co-founder, said she had been ""overwhelmed with interest"" from potential sponsors. Next year's winner is due to be announced on 5 June at London's Royal Festival Hall. An announcement said the prize would be privately funded while ""headline sponsorship negotiations for 2014 and beyond are concluded"". ""We were overwhelmed with interest from potential headline sponsors,"" said Kate Mosse, chair of the Women's Prize for Fiction board. ""However, it became clear sponsorship budgets for next year were already committed, so we took the decision to privately fund the Prize for 2013."" Funding has been provided in the form of gifts from companies and individual donors, some of whom wish to remain anonymous. The judges for the prize in 2013 will be actor Miranda Richardson (chair); Razia Iqbal, BBC journalist and broadcaster; Rachel Johnson, author, editor and journalist; JoJo Moyes, author; and Natasha Walter, feminist writer and human rights activist. ""This is a new departure for me and I am honoured to be working with judges who combine fine minds with, I suspect, great good humour,"" Richardson said. When Orange announced it was ending its sponsorship - to focus its brand on the film industry - Mosse wrote an open letter inviting potential sponsors to get in contact. In July she told the BBC that 18 companies had come forward and that ""serious conversations"" were taking place, but nothing had been finalised. For 2013, the prize will also enter a new partnership with Google ""on a number of new initiatives which will support the prize's ambition of reaching a wider, international audience"" via platforms such as Google+ and YouTube. This year debut US novelist Madeline Miller won the award with The Song of Achilles, a story of same-sex romance set in the Greek age of heroes. Previous winners include Tea Obreht for The Tiger's Wife (2011), Barbara Kingsolver for The Lacuna (2010) and Lionel Shriver for We Need to Talk About Kevin (2005).

"By Tim MastersEntertainment correspondent, BBC News, in Santa Monica The Kenyan actress turned 31 a day before the Oscars where she is a front runner for best supporting actress. 12 Years a Slave dominated the Independent Spirit Awards, where it took five prizes. They included best feature and best director for Britain's Steve McQueen. Other acting trophies went to Cate Blanchett, for her role in Blue Jasmine, and to Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto, for their roles as Aids patients in Dallas Buyers Club. All three are favourites to win at the Oscars on Sunday night. Stormy weather The annual Independent Spirit Awards, which honour low budget film-making, take place in a giant tent on Santa Monica beach. This year the ceremony was accompanied by strong winds and bursts of heavy rain beating down on the tent. 12 Years a Slave also won awards for screenplay and cinematography. Screenwriter John Ridley told the BBC after his win he didn't realise how affecting the story was until he experienced it on the big screen with an audience. ""I had no idea until I saw it in a room with 250 people and felt what they felt at that moment,"" he said. Picking up the best director award, McQueen dedicated it to the film's subject Solomon Northup who ""inspired me to look and find the truth"". Brad Pitt, who co-produced and starred in the film, said backstage: ""I thank Mr McQueen for bringing us all together to tell Solomon's story."" He added: ""It's interesting that it took a Brit to ask the questions why more films hadn't been made in America on our history."" Fruitvale Station was named best first feature while Nebraska won a best first screenplay award. Its writer Bob Nelson, 57, joked that it was the ""fulfilment of boyhood dream to be oldest recipient of a first time screenplay award"".

"Torin DouglasFormer media correspondent It is 15 years this month since it launched the original Al Jazeera Arabic channel, and five years since its English-language network brought its coverage to the centre of Washington and other western capitals. The station was once accused of ""peddling lies"" by the former US defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld, but Al Jazeera is now credited with playing a crucial role in the Arab Spring. It's not the only global TV channel changing the world view of politics. As Hillary Clinton, the US Secretary of State, told the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee earlier this year: ""We are in an information war - and we are losing that war. ""Al Jazeera is winning. The Chinese have opened up a global English-language and multi-language television network. The Russians have opened up an English-language network. I've seen it in a few countries and it's quite instructive."" Al Jazeera wouldn't thank Hillary Clinton for bracketing it with the state television services of China and Russia. Though owned by the government of Qatar, and now headed by a member of the Qatari royal family, it insists it's an independent broadcaster. Al Anstey, chief executive of Al Jazeera English, trained at CBS News and was head of foreign news at ITN. He says Al Jazeera Arabic was set up with similar ambitions - ""aiming at the Arab-speaking audience across the Middle East, as truth-telling in a very troubled region that was dominated by state-controller broadcasters, often mouthpieces of their own government. ""Al Jazeera English was started up in order to put that philosophy on the global stage."" Al Jazeera rose to prominence after 9/11, during the US air strikes on Afghanistan, when it was the only network allowed to report from there and the first to broadcast recorded statements by Osama Bin Laden. In 2004, the then US defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld expressed his anger. ""What Al Jazeera is doing is vicious, inaccurate and inexcusable"" he said. But earlier this year, interviewed on Al Jazeera English by Sir David Frost, he had changed his tune. ""The audience has grown and it can be an important means of communication in the world and I'm delighted you're doing what you're doing"" he said. ""I'm delighted to be doing it"" replied Sir David. The former director of Global News at the BBC, Richard Sambrook, is now global vice chairman of the Edelman PR agency. He says Al Jazeera does a good job maintaining its independence and played a crucial role in its coverage of the Arab Spring. ""Al Jazeera was a very important platform… through the first part of this year, particularly around the protests in Egypt, for reflecting what was happening on the ground, as against state television particularly in Egypt and other countries as well, which was refusing to accept the full depth of what was happening."" Now, as Hillary Clinton observed, more global services are launching in the English language, such as Russia Today. Often they look - and sound - very much like their western counterparts. The state-run China Central Television is opening new studios in Washington and, according to some reports, has plans for Europe too. Sambrook says that, as technology costs come down, more countries want a voice in the global dialogue, and they have different editorial values from, say, the BBC or CNN. ""There's no question that Press TV is trying to push the voice of Iran, for example. ""Russia Today is absolutely representing a Russian perspective, France 24 was set up to represent France's voice in the international arena, and of course Al Jazeera is very open about representing the voiceless and the Arab street into this global dialogue."" Whether the other channels will have as much impact over the next 15 years remains to be seen.",The broadcaster Al Jazeera is celebrating.
"The presenter said he was ""appalled"" to discover the gap between his salary and that of the likes of Emily Maitlis and Claudia Winkleman when the BBC first disclosed star salaries in 2017. The 54-year-old was listed as earning between £700,000 and £749,000. Winkleman earned less than £500,000 and Maitlis was on less than £150,000. Maitlis, who has presented Newsnight since 2006 and is Vine's election night co-host, later said she had gone ""on strike"" from the BBC until the pay gap was addressed. She now earns between £260,000-£264,999. Speaking to the Mail on Sunday, Vine said: ""I should say I really was appalled at the disparity with my female colleagues, because I did not know anything about that."" He explained that his 2016/17 earnings covered five presenting jobs - on Radio 2, Points of View, Panorama, Eggheads and the BBC's election coverage. ""That's quite a lot of work. Each of those was negotiated separately and this was the first time anyone had added them all up,"" he said. ""It's not like a salary. You're paid for these jobs and if you don't do them you're not paid. But to see it was a painful thing."" The Radio 2 presenter said he had subsequently chosen to take a pay cut. ""No-one said, 'You have to take it.' I just wanted to take one. My contract was coming up. They clearly wanted me to take one. I can't remember who raised it first."" His BBC salary is now in the £290,000-£294,000 bracket, although he is doing less work for the corporation and earns a separate salary from Channel 5 for his daytime talk show. The most recent list of BBC star salaries features three female presenters - Winkleman, Zoe Ball and Vanessa Feltz - in the top 10. Vine said he would leave it to others to assess the BBC's progress towards gender parity. ""My female colleagues have got together a very powerful WhatsApp group and they're campaigning, led by [Woman's Hour presenter] Jane Garvey and one or two others, so I'm just following that lead,"" he said. ""If they were to say it's sorted, I would believe it's sorted. They haven't said that yet."" Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

"Earlier this year, Mr Cameron suggested that the British film industry should concentrate on mainstream films. Redford, who is in London to showcase independent film as part of the 4-day Sundance London festival, called it ""a very narrow view"". ""That may be why he's in trouble,"" joked the veteran Hollywood actor. In January, Mr Cameron said he wanted to help ""UK producers to make commercially successful pictures that rival the quality and impact of the best international productions"". ""I don't want to say it speaks of the man,"" said Redford on Thursday. ""But I think that view is a very narrow one and doesn't speak to the broad category of film-makers and artists in the business."" Redford, 75, was speaking to reporters at the launch of Sundance London, beginning on Thursday at the O2 arena in Greenwich. The programme features 22 independent American films, including documentaries, feature films and short films, and is designed to represent ""the alchemy"" of Sundance. ""Sundance started as a path for new artists, new voices that wouldn't otherwise have a chance to be heard,"" said Redford, whose films include All the President's Men and The Great Gatsby. ""The festival has grown to such a degree that we wanted to move internationally,"" he added. ""We wanted to bring the alchemy of what we do in Sundance, and see how it was received - that's why we're here."" 'Fall-out' As a champion of independent film, the festival is credited with bringing such films as Reservoir Dogs, Blood Simple and Sex, Lies and Videotape to global attention. While Redford insisted it was not his intention to ""deny or eliminate mainstream film"", he admitted some misgivings about technological advances like 3D. ""I am not a particular fan of 3D at the moment. I think technology has probably got a little too far... too fast,"" he said. ""But I think the fall-out will occur on its own, organically. I think the audiences will decide,"" he went on ""Time will tell whether it really works or not, and I'm not sure it will."" His comments are in stark contrast to Hollywood contemporary Martin Scorsese, who has been fulsome in his praise of 3D and had great success with the medium in his Oscar-winning film Hugo. No indication has yet been given as to whether Sundance London is a one-off or will return in future years. Redford would not be drawn on the subject, opting for a wait-and-see approach. Yet he admitted to being wary of ""losing the soul"" of Sundance. ""Success has a dangerous side to it, something that I have been aware of my whole life,"" said the Oscar-winning star. ""You don't embrace it, so much as shadow-box with it. ""In reaching for the money, you can lose yourself. So I always pay attention to who we are, who we were and who we try to stay being. ""And at the same time, to welcome success but use it wisely, rather than poorly."" Sundance London runs from 26 to 29 April at the O2 in Greenwich, London.",Robert Redford has criticised Prime Minister David Cameron after he suggested that UK film-makers should focus on commercially viable movies.
"Mr Justice Nicol's High Court ruling said: ""I am not persuaded that the trial of the claim would be unfair."" Mr Depp is suing NGN and The Sun's executive editor Dan Wootton over an April 2018 article that referred to him as a ""wife beater"". Last month Justice Nicol ruled the actor had breached a court order. It followed an attempt by The Sun's publisher News Group Newspapers to have the case thrown out. NGN's lawyers had said Mr Depp breached the court order by not providing text messages relating to his alleged drug use. On Thursday, the judge said he would grant Mr Depp ""relief from sanctions"" over the breach of the order to disclose a text message exchange between himself and his assistant, which contained references to drugs. But Mr Justice Nicol said his decision was conditional on Mr Depp agreeing not to seek sanctions against his ex-wife Amber Heard for allegedly breaching another court order, made during separate libel proceedings in the US, by providing The Sun's legal team with evidence. 'Trial is imminent' The judge's legal ruling said:""Ms Heard has provided assistance to the defendants and has done so despite whatever may have been said by the claimant's US lawyers. I agree that it is important that she is not subjected to sanctions in another jurisdiction for having done so."" The Sun's original article related to allegations made against Mr Depp by Ms Heard, who claimed he was violent towards her during their marriage, which he strenuously denies. The judge ruled: ""The claim is far advanced and the trial is imminent. Despite the breach which I have found... I am not persuaded that the trial of the claim would be unfair."" Last week, NGN's legal team argued that Mr Depp's text messages, sent in late February and early March 2015, demonstrated he was trying to get hold of drugs while staying in Australia with Ms Heard, during which time an incident of domestic abuse is alleged to have occurred. Mr Depp's barrister had said the text messages were not relevant as they did not relate to the allegations of domestic violence that The Sun made reference to in an article headlined ""Gone Potty - How can JK Rowling be 'genuinely happy' casting wife beater Johnny Depp in the new Fantastic Beasts film?"" In his ruling in June, Mr Justice Nicol found that Mr Depp had breached an order requiring him to disclose documents from separate libel proceedings against Ms Heard in the US. The judge said: ""The Australian drug texts were adverse to the claimant's pleaded case and/or were supportive of the defendants' pleaded case."" But the judge did not make a declaration that Mr Depp's case was automatically struck out and said the actor's application for ""relief from sanctions"" would be heard. Depp, the 57-year-old star of the Pirates of the Caribbean films, has been Oscar and Bafta-nominated and won a Golden Globe in 2008 for Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street. He married Aquaman and The Danish Girl actress Amber Heard, 34, in February 2015, but she filed for divorce after 15 months. Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

"Breaking the Code, his 1986 play about Bletchley Park cryptographer Turing, was later filmed for TV with Sir Derek Jacobi reprising his stage performance. Whitemore's other works included 2002 TV movie The Gathering Storm, starring Albert Finney as Churchill. The drama won two Golden Globes, three Primetime Emmys and three TV Baftas. Born in Tunbridge Wells in Kent in 1936, Whitemore trained at Rada (Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts) before turning his hand to writing. He began his career in television, for which he adapted such novels as Cider with Rosie, David Copperfield and Moll Flanders. Stevie, his 1977 play about English poet Stevie Smith, starred Glenda Jackson in the title role and was filmed the following year. Whitemore also enjoyed success with 84 Charing Cross Road, a real-life story of a friendship based on letters he adapted for television in 1975 and for film in 1987. Pack of Lies, his 1983 play about Russian spies operating clandestinely in suburban Ruislip, also began life as a BBC production. Whitemore's recent works included 2003 film My House in Umbria, starring Dame Maggie Smith, and the 2016 play Sand in the Sandwiches, in which Edward Fox played poet John Betjeman. Writing in The Guardian, critic Michael Coveney described him as ""an accomplished craftsman for theatre and TV for more than 50 years"".

"The Rheinoper, based in Dusseldorf, said some of the audience had to seek medical help following early performances of Tannhauser. But the producer ""refused"" to tone down the staging, set in a concentration camp during the Holocaust. The production has now been cancelled with only concert performances planned. ""After considering all the arguments, we have come to the conclusion that we cannot justify such an extreme impact of our artistic work,"" said a statement from Deutsche Oper am Rhein. ""With paramount concern, we note that some scenes (especially the shooting scene) were depicted very realistically,"" the statement continued, causing ""psychological and physical stress"" to some audience members. Despite ""intensive conversation"" with German theatre director and actor Burkhard C Kosminski about possible changes to the production, ""he refused to do this for artistic reasons"", according to the statement. ""Of course, we have to respect - and also for legal reasons - the artistic freedom of the director,"" the opera house said. Management at the Rheinoper said they were aware that the ""concept and implementation"" of the Kosminski's production would be ""controversial"". The production, which opened last weekend, provoked ""violent protests"" on its opening night, according to local newspaper reports. Head of Dusseldorf's Jewish community Michael Szentei-Heise told the Associated Press news agency: ""Members of the audience booed and banged the doors when they left the opera house in protest"". He called the adaptation ""tasteless and not legitimate"". The original Tannhauser, set in Germany in the Middle Ages, was first performed in Dresden in 1845. It was based on a traditional ballad about the bard Tannhauser and features a singing contest at the Wartburg Castle.",A controversial production of a Wagner opera at one of the major German opera houses has been cancelled because of harrowing scenes involving Nazis.
"However, the complainant focused on Munchetty at the third and final stage of the complaints process. Last week, the BBC partially upheld a complaint against Munchetty. The Breakfast presenter had criticised the US President's motives after he had said four female politicians should ""go back"" to ""places from which they came"". Munchetty is not facing any disciplinary action or reprimand. The BBC complaints procedure has three stages, with the third and final being referral to the executive complaints unit (ECU). A BBC spokesman said: ""The appeal to the ECU focused on comments by one presenter. ""But the statement from the executive team on Friday is clear, the BBC is not impartial on racism. Racism is not an opinion and it is not a matter for debate. Racism is racism. Naga has the very clear support of the top of the organisation."" Speaking last week, the BBC's head of editorial standards, David Jordan, said Walker did not help the situation by leading the conversation into the sphere of opinion. ""Dan Walker's contribution was not, as it were, helpful in the context. It could be said that Dan Walker kind of led Naga Munchetty to the conclusion that she eventually made,"" he said. ""I'm afraid the Executive Complaints Unit deals with the complaints it gets, so some people say why isn't Dan Walker being singled out in the same way? The simple fact is we haven't had a complaint."" Munchetty received messages of support from both inside and outside the BBC following the ECU's ruling. Dozens of black actors and broadcasters called on the BBC to overturn its decision to uphold the complaint against Munchetty. Sir Lenny Henry and Gina Yashere are among 44 stars who asked the BBC to revisit the ruling in an open letter. The BBC said the letter was ""based on a misunderstanding of the editorial guidelines and how they apply"". What do the BBC editorial guidelines say? The guidelines say presenters can have a ""significant effect"" on whether the corporation is seen as impartial. Mr Jordan said Munchetty fell foul of the following part of the impartiality section of the guidelines: ""Our audiences should not be able to tell from BBC output the personal opinions of our journalists or news and current affairs presenters on matters of public policy, political or industrial controversy, or on 'controversial subjects' in any other area. ""They may provide professional judgements, rooted in evidence, but may not express personal views on such matters publicly, including in any BBC-branded output or on personal blogs and social media."" Meanwhile, Ofcom said it would assess whether to investigate Munchetty's remarks against its broadcasting code. The media regulator said it had received two complaints, with Labour MP Chi Onwurah posting her letter to Ofcom on Twitter. What did Naga Munchetty say in the first place? Walker: It's the president. That was the most telling quote for me last night. I can't remember who said it, but she said, 'I've been told to go home many times to go back to where I've come from many times in my life, but never by the man sitting in the Oval Office'. Munchetty: Every time I have been told, as a woman of colour, to go back to where I came from, that was embedded in racism. Now I'm not accusing anyone of anything here but you know what certain phrases mean. Walker: Do you hear that quite regularly? Munchetty: Yes. Not regularly, but I've been told it. Walker: You're sitting here not giving an opinion, but how do you feel as someone when you've been told that before, and when you hear that from him? Munchetty: Furious. Absolutely furious. And I imagine a lot of people in this country will be feeling absolutely furious that a man in that position feels it's OK to skirt the lines with using language like that. Walker: Do you feel his use of that then legitimises other people to use this… Munchetty: Yes. Yes. Walker: As our guest was saying there, it feels like a thought-out strategy to strengthen his position. Munchetty: And it is not enough to do it just to get attention. He's in a responsible position.

"Tony Hall - who used to run the Royal Opera House - says he wants to return the arts to the corporation's ""heart"". It will mean plays, art exhibitions and more live music from around the UK being broadcast on the BBC. Among Lord Hall's proposals are a new ""BBC Arts at"" brand and new television series fronted by historian Simon Schama and broadcaster Andrew Marr. The director general, formerly the BBC's head of news, returned to the corporation following the Jimmy Savile scandal. He wants to see the BBC collaborate more with arts institutions around the country. In a speech on Tuesday he is expected to announce new partnerships with London's British Museum, the Tate and the Manchester International Festival. The plans mean that more opening nights, major exhibitions and arts events will be shown live on television. Hidden heroes An experimental digital service, known as The Space and developed by the BBC and Arts Council England, is also due to be relaunched in 2014. ""Arts programming sits right at the heart of the BBC and is a vital part of who we are, but I want us to to be much more ambitious,"" Lord Hall said. ""We need to showcase more of the incredible talent that this country has to offer to the widest possible audiences."" The BBC's arts correspondent David Sillito said Lord Hall is keen to ""return the BBC back to the founding principles of its first director general John Reith to inform, educate and entertain"". ""We already know a few of the details of today's speech but this is being presented as something rather broader, an outline of Lord Hall's vision of the future,"" he said.

Lord Hall is also due to announce major new television series featuring two faces familiar to BBC audiences. Simon Schama will front a five-part series in partnership with the National Portrait Gallery, exploring the history of Britain through portraiture. A series looking at the greatest writers in Scotland will be presented by journalist Andrew Marr. And there will be a series of six BBC One programmes seeking to uncover the ""hidden heroes"" of British art, with 10 amateurs competing for the title of Britain's best artist.

Alistair Smith, print editor of The Stage, said: ""Sonia Friedman has enjoyed a number of notable hits in recent years - including Jerusalem starring Mark Rylance and The Book of Mormon - but in 2016, she went stratospheric. ""Harry Potter and the Cursed Child was always likely to be a licence to print money. What has made it really special was that Friedman and her fellow creatives resisted the temptation to treat the production as a cash cow and created something truly magical, original and - above all - theatrical."" The only other woman to top the list was Stoll Moss Theatres boss Janet Holmes a Court in 1998. In this year's list, Friedman beat Andrew Lloyd Webber - who is at number two.

"By Mark SavageBBC Music reporter Dressed in a snakeskin jumpsuit, he draped his arm around guitarist Mick Ronson, shocking viewers and ushering in an era of glamour and androgyny. But few people remember that Bowie actually debuted his Ziggy Stardust persona on ITV a month earlier. Long thought to have been erased, the performance has just been unearthed and could feature in a new BBC documentary. It was captured by a fan on a home video recorder - but the tape has degraded and must be slowly ""baked"" in an incubator in the hopes of restoring the footage. ""For fans, it is something of a Holy Grail,"" Francis Whately, producer and director of David Bowie: Finding Fame, told the Radio Times. ""It would fall apart if we played it, so it's had to be very carefully restored. It will be a real coup if it comes off."" The process of restoration is still underway, and will continue until very close to the transmission of the documentary - expected to be next month on BBC Two. ""The footage has only very recently been discovered,"" said a BBC spokeswoman. ""We're hoping it will be ready in time to include in the film."" 'Terrible' mistake Bowie's ""lost"" performance was on the ITV teatime show Lift Off With Ayshea, a commercial rival to Top of the Pops, which ran from 1969 to 1974. Almost all of the footage was accidentally wiped when Granada TV sent the tapes to be digitised. According to host Ayshea Brough, duplicate recordings had been marked with an ""x"", meaning they could be deleted, but the technician somehow misunderstood and binned the originals. ""He wiped years of my life and performances, and everybody else's performances,"" she told Record Collector magazine. ""It's a terrible thing."" David Bowie: Finding Fame is the final in film-maker Francis Whatley's trilogy of documentaries about the convention-defying pop star. The 90-minute programme promises to feature unheard audio recordings and archival footage - including a 1965 BBC audition of Bowie and his band the Lower Third performing Chim-Chim-Cheree and Baby, That's a Promise. The BBC famously rejected the star for its talent selection group after this performance, describing him as ""a cockney chap, but not outstanding enough"" and ""devoid of personality"". The talent group was responsible for checking that any act putting itself forward for BBC radio play met its quality standards. ""These are the stepping stones that led to Ziggy, but also many of the failures that led to Ziggy,"" said Whatley. ""It shows how Bowie embraced them and learnt from them all.""

"Meyne Wyatt, 24, will make his debut as Nate Kinski on 13 August. The episode will be shown on 27 August in the UK on Channel 5. The soap has featured indigenous actors before but not in the main cast. The show, based in a fictional suburb outside Melbourne, has been accused of not reflecting ethnic diversity during its 29-year history. Previous indigenous actors who have appeared in the soap include Tony Briggs in the late 1980s. He was the first Aboriginal actor to appear on the show. In 2012, a South Asian family, called the Kapoors, moved into Ramsay Street, but they were written out of the soap a year later. 'Best people' Actor Sachin Joab, who played Ajay Kapoor, told Digital Spy last year: ""It was more of a shock to us knowing that it wasn't just one multicultural actor who was being written out, it was every single multicultural full-time actor on the show. ""All four of us were written out in the first year of our full-time contracts, which felt like a massive step backwards in terms of cultural diversity on the show. ""Australia is stuck in some sort of time capsule... For some reason when it's fiction over here, the industry chooses to exclude non-whites and include whites only. It's very unrealistic given that Australia is a very multicultural country,"" he added. But speaking to the Guardian about casting Wyatt, Neighbours' series producer Jason Herbison said: ""While cultural diversity is definitely important, in cases where we don't need a specific ethnic background, our brief to agents is to put forward their best people and that was the case for this character."" Born in the remote town of Kalgoolie in western Australia, Wyatt's passion for acting emerged when he attended boarding school in Perth. He graduated from the country's National Institute of Dramatic Arts (NIDA), and was named best newcomer in the 2011 Sydney theatre awards. He recently completed the feature film Strangerland starring Nicole Kidman, Joseph Fiennes and Guy Pearce, due for release in 2015. His Neighbours character already has a connection with two of Ramsay Street's long-term residents, Susan and Karl Kennedy.

"Ayres was at the forefront of the British contemporary art scene from the 1950s, and became known for paintings filled with vibrant shapes and colours. She was nominated for the Turner Prize in 1989 and was made a CBE in 2011. Agent Alan Cristea said that, as a female abstract artist in the UK, she was ""way ahead of her time and the vast majority of her male counterparts"". She saw her gender as ""an irrelevance"" when it came to her art, however, he said. ""She was immensely courageous, independent and determined in both her art and her lifestyle."" Cristea fondly recalled visits to her studio on the the Devon/Cornwall border, which would involve ""lavish meals, large doses of champagne and riveting anecdotes delivered through clouds of cigarette smoke"". He added: ""She was a joy. I loved her to bits and will miss her enormously."" Ayres' first solo show was staged in 1957, and she took part in a number of influential exhibitions in the 1950s and '60s. She went on to have solo shows at the Serpentine Gallery in London in 1983, the Tate Gallery in 1995, and the Royal Academy of Arts in 1997. She had been elected to the Royal Academy in 1987, and 15 of her works are now in the Tate collection. Last year, she had major solo exhibitions at the National Museum Wales in Cardiff and at CAFA Art Museum in Beijing. She never painted portraits or landscapes. ""Shapes. Spaces. It's the way I see the world,"" she once said. ""To me, art - colour in art - is wonderfully indulging. I don't see why you shouldn't be filling yourself up, making yourself happy. Enjoying yourself.

"The former Beatle can be seen getting the badge - the rarest award the programme gives - on Thursday's Blue Peter on CBBC. The musician was given the badge for inspiring generations of people. McCartney said: ""I will wear it with great pride"". Blue Peter presenter Lindsey Russell gave McCartney the award, just before he went on stage at the O2 arena in London. Russell asked the Beatles and Wings singer what advice he would give to young people who want to become musicians and songwriters. McCartney said: ""The only advice really is to do it... a lot. ""I have a song writing class and the first thing I say to them is 'Look, I don't really know how to do this' and at first they kind of look at me, but when you think about it there is no formula."" Only a few gold Blue Peter badges are awarded each year. They are the only badge the children's programme - which began in 1958 - awards to adults. Gold Blue Peter badges are given to people for outstanding achievements, like saving a life, or inspiring the nation. The Queen, eight-time Olympic champion sprinter Usain Bolt and Harry Potter author JK Rowling all hold gold Blue Peter badges.

"By Ian YoungsEntertainment & arts reporter We meet under a motorway flyover near Manchester Piccadilly station - 100 or so ravers ready to be led to a secret location for a next-generation gig experience. We follow crew members wearing rave masks and single yellow gloves on a 10-minute walking tour of urban dereliction. Some people are even bundled into cars for added theatrical effect and transported to the venue, not knowing where they're going. It's all presumably designed to hark back to the thrill of the acid house days when ravers would only find out a party location at the last minute. Except this is a highly organised event, and our guides have undoubtedly been briefed about health and safety. We're eventually led to the back of a grimy warehouse, next to a yard where scrap lorries are parked, and are given soft, slim pouches to slip our phones into before they are sealed for the night. The Yondr pouches have become popular with some musicians and comedians who are fed up with audiences watching live shows through their screens. Skepta is one of those. Speaking at the Manchester International Festival (MIF) launch in March, the Mercury Prize-winning MC said nightclubs had ""turned into places for this new individualism, where people are just on their phones to have a 'fake good time'"". When MIF approached him to create a special show, he decided phones would be banned. MIF specialises in staging shows that are out of the ordinary so the phone ban isn't the only unusual thing about Dystopia987, which ran for three nights. Skepta created it with cutting-edge creative studio TEM, who experiment with emerging technologies; and award-winning playwright Dawn King. Details were deliberately scarce but the show was billed as ""a journey into the future of rave"" involving ""a series of individual and collective experiences [that] have been developed using mixed reality"". Mixed reality is where virtual and physical objects exist together, and people can supposedly interact with digital creations in the real world. Entering the venue, we're told about something called Intelligent Rave Software, and some sort of higher omnipotent being called Darmian (possibly named after Manchester United's Matteo Darmian, but I may have misheard). We are each given a small coloured token that is a ""token of thanks from Darmian"". ""Your interaction is required,"" Darmian informs us in headphones we are given on the way in. Hippy-protest placards with slogans like ""Free your ego"", ""Free your spirit"" and ""Free from phones"" hang on the walls. Someone is holding a prosthetic leg. In the next room - a long, large railway arch - a DJ is at a central podium. She looks real. Curious about what is meant to happen, I ask a crew member wearing a red face mask what the tokens are for. ""I can either give you a handshake, a high five or a hug."" I opt for the hug. He feels real. ""Now I can either give you a back rub or a group experience."" Warily, I join a group huddle with three crew members. We must each give a compliment to the person on our left. The first rave leader whispers something to the person next to him, who whispers to me that he likes the flashing rave glasses I have just bought in an attempt to fit in. I compliment the young woman to my left on her striking pink eye make-up. Which is all lovely, but there's not much of a storyline, and the only obvious sign of ""mixed reality"" is a small red room in the corner where you can try a pair of Magic Leap goggles that overlay some pretty underwhelming graphics onto your vision. The venue fills up as more people are led there until it reaches its 1,000 capacity. The DJ stays on the podium until eventually an announcement says we are ready to take the next step, and plastic sheeting is ripped away, revealing two doorways to an adjoining room. It's a mirror of the previous room - a long, thin tunnel with blackened brick walls and a high arched ceiling. The stage is a scaffold tower planted in the centre of the room like the leg of a bridge in a river of ravers. Skepta, hooded and wearing neon gloves, circles the tower on a platform from where he can perform his pounding set to the melee of fans on either side. Someone is waving a prosthetic arm in the air like they just don't care. When the MC addresses the crowd between songs, it's to tell us to show each other our love, or to say we're more free when we're not posting to Instagram. ""I was bored of everybody in the club telling everybody outside the club how much of a good time they're having,"" Skepta says. There are big cheers as he tells fans that tonight they are not their Instagram name, they are not their Twitter name. ""You're yourself, right here, together with everybody, right here, now."" It seems he is trying hard to recapture an energy that came effortlessly in this city in the legendary ""second summer of love"" 30 years ago. ""This is one of the best things I've experienced in my whole life,"" he marvels. Normally there would be a sea of screens at a gig, but here the only lights in the crowd are flashing LED eyelashes, illuminated cheek beads and fairy light necklaces. ""I can't predict the future but I know it's going to be something like this,"" Skepta says. Impressive visuals are projected onto clear screens surrounding the stage's central tower, but Skepta proves that the human connection with a mesmerising performer is more powerful than any technology. And it looks like the ""future of rave"" actually involves reclaiming an unselfconscious spirit from the past. The night's best use of tech involves putting it into pouches. The evening will live in the memory of those who were there, rather than their camera roll. The crowd filters into the damp street, having had one of the nights of their lives. After getting their pouches unlocked on the way out, they check their phones and then head home.

"The death of Sir George, the veteran music producer who signed The Beatles, was confirmed on Wednesday morning. In a statement posted on his website, Sir Paul said he had ""so many wonderful memories"" of Sir George. ""The world has lost a truly great man who left an indelible mark on my soul and the history of British music,"" he said. Sir George produced more than 700 records, working with artists including Gerry and the Pacemakers, Dame Shirley Bassey and Cilla Black. Obituary: Sir George Martin Live: Tributes paid to Sir George Martin Will Gompertz: Sir George Martin 'made' The Beatles In full: Paul McCartney pays tribute to Sir George Martin I'm so sad to hear the news of the passing of dear George Martin. I have so many wonderful memories of this great man that will be with me forever. He was a true gentleman and like a second father to me. He guided the career of The Beatles with such skill and good humour that he became a true friend to me and my family. If anyone earned the title of the fifth Beatle it was George. From the day that he gave The Beatles our first recording contract, to the last time I saw him, he was the most generous, intelligent and musical person I've ever had the pleasure to know. It's hard to choose favourite memories of my time with George, there are so many but one that comes to mind was the time I brought the song Yesterday to a recording session and the guys in the band suggested that I sang it solo and accompany myself on guitar. After I had done this George Martin said to me, ""Paul I have an idea of putting a string quartet on the record."" I said, ""Oh no George, we are a rock and roll band and I don't think it's a good idea"". With the gentle bedside manner of a great producer he said to me: ""Let us try it and if it doesn't work we won't use it and we'll go with your solo version."" I agreed to this and went round to his house the next day to work on the arrangement. He took my chords that I showed him and spread the notes out across the piano, putting the cello in the low octave and the first violin in a high octave and gave me my first lesson in how strings were voiced for a quartet. When we recorded the string quartet at Abbey Road, it was so thrilling to know his idea was so correct that I went round telling people about it for weeks. His idea obviously worked because the song subsequently became one of the most recorded songs ever with versions by Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley, Ray Charles, Marvin Gaye and thousands more. This is just one of the many memories I have of George who went on to help me with arrangements on Eleanor Rigby, Live and Let Die and many other songs of mine. I am proud to have known such a fine gentleman with such a keen sense of humour, who had the ability to poke fun at himself. Even when he was knighted by the Queen there was never the slightest trace of snobbery about him. My family and I, to whom he was a dear friend, will miss him greatly and send our love to his wife Judy and their kids, Giles and Lucy, and the grandkids. The world has lost a truly great man who left an indelible mark on my soul and the history of British music. God bless you George and all who sail in you!","Sir Paul McCartney has paid tribute to Sir George Martin, saying he was ""like a second father"" to him."

"Lord Hall told a committee of MPs the pay disclosures had ""made it harder for us to retain people like that"". Evans is moving from Radio 2 to Virgin, while Mair has joined LBC from Radio 4. ""We have to recognise we're not going to attract people at the kind of mega sums others in the commercial sphere might be able to pay,"" Lord Hall said. The director general said Evans found the pressure ""quite hard"" after topping the BBC talent pay list last year and coming second in this year's list. ""For three or four days he was the centre of a lot of attention,"" he said. Lord Hall told the House of Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee: ""[It has a] bearing on when you think about where you want to work in the future. I think he's a remarkable presenter. He's a loss to the BBC, a loss to our audiences."" However, Lord Hall also said: ""I have no complaint, disclosure is a good thing."" He added that Evans, who was paid £1.66m in 2017-18, also wanted to leave so he could find a new challenge. Last year was the first time the pay of stars earning more than £150,000 had been made public. The BBC was compelled to reveal the information under the terms of its new royal charter. Lord Hall said the corporation would ""find the next generation of talent"" and promote from within rather than compete with the ""mega"" salaries on offer from commercial rivals. ""A lot of [current BBC] presenters I know could make possibly more money outside but actually are not doing it for that - they're doing it because they're committed to the BBC and I admire them hugely for that,"" he said. ""But of course we will lose some people and of course we have lost a couple of people for a large number of reasons, but no doubt disclosure and the fact people know their pay has been a factor in some of those losses."" Lord Hall was asked about equal pay at the corporation, given that the top 12 earners on the BBC's latest list of star salaries are all men. ""Myself and the team want to get to the point where the top 20 are made up equally of men and women and not just women at the bottom and men at the top,"" he said. The director general also revealed he had approached Sir Cliff Richard personally ahead of the recent court case involving the BBC. In July, Sir Cliff won his privacy case against the corporation over its coverage of a 2014 police raid on his home. The singer said the BBC's reporting of the raid, which included helicopter footage of his home being searched, was a ""serious invasion"" of privacy. He was never arrested or charged. Lord Hall said: ""We approached Sir Cliff's lawyers and... I approached Sir Cliff on a couple of occasions suggesting could we sit down and try to sort this out without going to the court. ""But sadly, and, I guess understandably, the legal view came back that, 'We don't want to talk.'"" Lord Hall added that Sir Cliff's team said they were only prepared to reach a settlement if the BBC admitted it had acted illegally, but he said he didn't think the corporation had acted illegally. 'Weighty decision' He said: ""We are really sorry about what Sir Cliff has been through. ""We reported accurately what happened but we overdid it, the helicopter overdid it, it was something to report but [further] down the bulletin."" Lord Hall also said the BBC would be publishing a new edition of its editorial guidelines later this autumn, following the Sir Cliff episode. The committee also discussed the BBC licence fee concession for over-75s. The government used to meet this cost in its entirety but it was agreed in 2015 that the BBC would take on the full cost of the concession over a phased period. The BBC is due to absorb the full cost from 2020/21 - but Lord Hall said the corporation will review whether it continues to offer the arrangement after that time. Lord Hall said it was ""a difficult balance between what people can afford and our need to give proper services"". He added: ""[It's]quite a weighty decision. A very difficult issue."" The total financial liability for licences for over-75s for 2017/18 was £655m. Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

"The team, including host Jeremy Clarkson, have been filming in South America for a Top Gear special. The show apparently provoked anger among locals by using a Porsche with the registration number H982 FKL. The BBC confirmed the show's decision to leave, but denied the offending car was chosen for its number plate. Andy Wilman, executive producer for Top Gear, said on Thursday: ""Top Gear production purchased three cars for a forthcoming programme; to suggest that this car was either chosen for its number plate, or that an alternative number plate was substituted for the original is completely untrue."" The team departed three days early after being denied permission to film by local authorities. It was reported the cars had been abandoned by the roadside and the crew were escorted to the airport after being pelted with stones. Clarkson flew into the country earlier last month to film a special which saw him and co-stars Richard Hammond and James May drive the famous Patagonian highway - Route 40 - to the southernmost city of Ushuaia.

In July Ofcom ruled that Top Gear had breached broadcasting rules after Jeremy Clarkson had used a racial slur during a Top Gear special in Burma. A 2011 episode caused a diplomatic incident in Mexico. Co-host Richard Hammond said Mexican cars reflected national characteristics - saying they were like a ""lazy, feckless, flatulent oaf with a moustache, leaning against a fence asleep, looking at a cactus with a blanket with a hole in the middle on as a coat"". In May this year, the BBC faced calls to fire Clarkson after leaked footage showed him mumbling an offensive version of the nursery rhyme Eeny, Meeny, Miny, Moe in a clip that was not broadcast. Clarkson revealed he had been given a final warning and would be sacked if he made ""one more offensive remark, anywhere, at any time"".",The crew of BBC's Top Gear have left Argentina after facing protests over a number plate which appeared to refer to the 1982 Falklands War.

"The chorus of Taylor's new single Look What You Made Me Do follows the same rhythmic pattern as I'm Too Sexy. After the song was released overnight, the duo tweeted: ""Thank you Taylor Swift, what a marvellous reinvention!"" The group's spokesman confirmed to the BBC they were approached by Taylor's team in advance of the release. The band gave their permission for the song to be used and they've received an acknowledgement from Taylor as a result. The track's credits list three members of Right Said Fred - Richard Fairbrass, Fred Fairbrass and Rob Manzoli - as songwriters alongside Swift and Jack Antonoff. (If you're having trouble, try singing ""I'm too sexy for my shirt"" when Taylor sings ""Ooh, look what you made me do"" and you'll hear the similarities.) But the nod to the single wasn't enough to save it from some lukewarm reviews from critics. Perez Hilton described the song as ""seriously lacking"". ""Overall, we are NOT impressed with TayTay's new tune. We're not feeling the chorus, the lyrics (which are not relatable in the slightest), or the overall production/structure,"" he said. Writing in NME, Dan Stubbs said: ""The sound is hard-edged pop - like her smash 1989 album, but darker, more electronic. ""If people have had their claws out for Taylor following that album's success and the reign of her and her squad, the message is clear: this new incarnation is going to bite back."" The Telegraph's Sarah Carson said: ""Taylor Swift is a force to be reckoned with... this is a comeback laden with vengeance."" ""Look What You Made Me Do is a ruthless rebuttal to anyone who had foolishly expected a redemptive return from Swift. Instead, it explains how she has become the 'snake' she has been billed as through the betrayal of others. ""What is missing, however, is the musical reinvention some may have expected. Forget the rumours of a return to country or a foray into rap or dubstep; Swift's in her own well-trodden and inevitably chart-topping territory."" Writing for The Evening Standard, David Smyth said: ""The edgy music suits the fist-swinging tone: industrial electronic drums, low, nasty synth sounds and high strings and piano which give a sense of unhinged threat rather than beauty."" ""There's not much in the way of a tune but it's naggingly memorable nonetheless. It's unlikely to be many people's new favourite Swift song, demanded in encores for years hence. ""To Swift, who no doubt has plenty of catchier singles ready to go, that's less important than the statement it makes."" The Guardian's Maura Johnston wrote: ""Swift's lyrics are visceral and almost sloppy, with her rhyming 'time' and 'time' on the Lorde-channelling pre-chorus, and melodramatically declaring that ""the old Taylor"" is 'dead!'. ""The chorus borrows its cadence from Right Said Fred's 1992 body-shaker I'm Too Sexy, a ridiculous touch that at least cuts the acid a bit.""

"By Kev GeogheganArts and entertainment reporter Letters Live involves performers reading monologues based on real life correspondence. At Wilderness the event took on a music theme with letters from artists such as Queen's Roger Taylor, as well as correspondence addressed to the Rolling Stones. Kingsman star Mark Strong gave voice to the legendary US rock critic Lester Bang and his 1978 letter to the Village Voice, on his theories about the birth of punk music. Sherlock star Cumberbatch performed a hilarious letter written by Queen drummer Roger Taylor to Rolling Stone magazine, disputing a negative review of the band. ""Your peculiar 1970 time warp attitude, coupled with an innate congenital miscomprehension of rock and roll continues to fascinate and annoy,"" he read to laughter from the audience. Fresh Meat actress Zawe Ashton gave voice to a young Fijian schoolchild whose angry letter to the Rolling Stones apparently now hangs in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio. The letter was prompted by an off the cuff remark by the band's manager about the muted reception to their arrival on the island. ""Just wanted you to know, me and my friends with nearly the whole school, hate you,"" she began. ""Because you don't look like men, you are nothing but animals and smell like them too. "" Rev star Hollander brought roars of laughter from the audience as he faithfully quoted an outrageously graphic love letter by Country Gardens composer Percy Grainger, as florid as it was pornographic. There were some sober moments as Strong, celebrating his birthday and receiving a sung tribute from the audience, recalled a powerful letter written in 1884 from the artist Vincent van Gogh to his brother Theo. ""You don’t know how paralyzing it is, that stare from a blank canvas that says to the painter you can’t do anything,"" Strong read. ""The canvas has an idiotic stare, and mesmerizes some painters so that they turn into idiots themselves.""","Benedict Cumberbatch, Tom Hollander and Mark Strong performed alongside a number of other actors and celebrities at a secret performance of Letters Live at the Wilderness Festival, in Oxfordshire."

"In an interview with ABC News, Vivian Thoreen called Jamie Spears ""a fiercely loving, dedicated and loyal father"" who had stopped her from being exploited. Jamie Spears was made his daughter's conservator in 2008 after concerns were raised about the star's mental health. A recent documentary has led to renewed scrutiny of her legal arrangements. ""I understand that every story needs a villain but people have it so wrong here,"" Ms Thoreen told ABC's Good Morning America on Thursday. She said unnamed people had been ""harming and exploiting"" the singer and that Mr Spears had ""rescued"" her from ""a life-threatening situation"". ""Britney's assets were clearly being mismanaged and she was being taken advantage of financially by some of those around her,"" the lawyer continued. She added that Mr Spears had ""collaborated"" with his daughter, now 39, so that she could ""live her life the way she wants, like a normal person"". A conservatorship is usually granted for people who are unable to make their own decisions, like those with dementia or other mental illnesses. Last November the singer lost a legal attempt to remove her father's control over her estate, currently worth around $60m (£43m), but in February this year a judge denied a request by Mr Spears to exert greater control over her finances. According to Ms Spears' lawyer, Britney and her father have no ""viable working relationship"" and have not spoken in a ""long while"". Ms Thoreen stated otherwise, claiming they had spent time together last year and she had never voiced a wish to have him removed from the conservatorship. ""Early on in the pandemic they spent two weeks with other family members, hunkered down in Louisiana, and they spent a lot of time together,"" she told ABC News. ""In that time, Britney never expressed those words to her father. She's never asked him to step aside."" She said ABC News would have to ""ask Britney"" why her lawyer had stated otherwise. 'Taking time to be a normal person' Spears' life and career has returned to the headlines due to the documentary Framing Britney Spears, which explores the celebrity and media culture at the time of her meteoric rise. According to her lawyer Samuel D Ingham, the singer will not perform as long as her father oversees her affairs. The singer has said she is ""taking the time to learn and be a normal person"" and was ""simply enjoying the basics of everyday life"". ""No matter what we think we know about a person's life it is nothing compared to the actual person living behind the lens,"" she wrote on Instagram. In a subsequent post, she said it was ""so much fun"" spending time with boyfriend Sam Asghari, ""especially when you don't have to do anything at all"". The accompanying video showed Asghari, who has been dating Spears since 2016, giving her a piggy-back ride while out on a hike. Earlier this week former child star Mara Wilson expressed solidarity with the singer, saying she was a victim of a culture that ""builds girls up just to destroy them"".

"By Mark SavageBBC News entertainment reporter Last year, with almost no fanfare, a song called Video Games popped up on YouTube. An achingly beautiful piano ballad by an unknown singer, it had been rejected by almost every record company that heard it. The song was too long, they said, too melancholy. And it needed drums if it was to get any radio play. Lana Del Rey didn't believe any of them. She persuaded a tiny independent label to release the song, and created the promo clip at home on her MacBook. Twenty-two million views later, she's got a major label deal, a contract with Next Model management, and is about to release one of the most-anticipated albums of 2012. So who is Lana Del Rey? She was born Elizabeth Grant in New York City 25 years ago. Raised in the Winter Olympics venue of Lake Placid, she was surrounded by a ""really big family"" and had started studying philosophy when, aged 18, her uncle taught her ""six basic chords"" on the guitar. ""It was G, C, A,"" she recalls, absent-mindedly stretching her fingers into the chord formations. ""It was D minor, A minor and some diminished chord as well. Some trick, some shortcut. ""I realised I could probably write a million songs with those six chords - so I moved to New York and I took a couple of years to just write whatever I wanted."" She had an early stab at recording an album - 2008's Lizzy Grant aka Lana Del Ray - which was made for $10,000 (£6,000) with Paul McCartney and Regina Spektor's producer David Kahne. But it was never formally released, popping up on iTunes for two months in 2010 before quietly disappearing. ""I had signed to an independent label but they couldn't fund the release of it,"" says Del Rey. ""People act like it's so shrouded in mystery, the 'forgotten terrible album'. ""But if you look on YouTube, all 13 tracks are available with millions of views, so it's not like no-one's heard them. ""We were all proud of it. It's pretty good."" The singer recently bought back the rights to the record, and says: ""I'm re-releasing it, maybe in late summer."" Cinematic Her major label debut, Born To Die, refines the formula set out on that early material. A sweeping epic of doomed love affairs and bruised glamour, it could be the lost soundtrack to a film noir. Del Rey's vocals have a cinematic quality, too. One minute, she's a breathy femme fatale; the next, a languorous, sultry diva: Marilyn Monroe and Marlene Dietrich competing for control of the microphone. In person, however, the singer is more down-to-earth. Softly-spoken and doe-eyed, she comes from a close-knit family. Her left hand is tattooed with a capital letter ""M"" for her grandmother, Madeleine. And while her lyrics revel in seedy romance (""he loves me with every beat of his cocaine heart"") they were largely inspired by a single, happy relationship. ""I never thought I'd have the luxury of loving someone and being loved,"" says Del Rey. ""But when it happened, it really was what they talked about in the movies."" The affair was so all-consuming that Del Rey ""let go of my musical ambitions"" and ""settled"" into a life of domesticity. In Video Games, she is completely smitten: ""He holds me in his big arms. Drunk and I am seeing stars. This is all I think of."" ""People talk about me being an anti-feminist because of that song,"" the singer says. ""They think it's coming from a place of submissiveness. But in reality it was more about coming together and doing your own things happily in the same living space."" The relationship eventually ended but Del Rey doesn't mind revisiting the memories. ""You should honour love, even when it's lost,"" she says. ""I've been separated from various things and people in my life that I wanted to stay close to. By staying calm and being strong, I was honouring the memory of those things and those people. ""I'm proud of that, and I continue to do that."" Legal troubles After Video Games became a break-out hit last October, Del Rey was snapped up in a joint UK/US deal by Polydor Records and Interscope - the latter of which is home to Lady Gaga and Madonna. The main benefit was the sudden availability of a copyright lawyer. ""I got sued over the video for Video Games,"" Del Rey explains. ""That was a bad day. A million views and it got wiped out."" The video had been cut together from faded, vintage footage the singer found on YouTube. She had assumed it was free. It turned out to be a legal headache. ""So now I have a specialist who reaches out to get permission when I make a video."" But there are also disadvantages to working with two of the world's biggest record companies. Some of the people who championed Del Rey early in her career have turned their backs on the singer, accusing her of selling out. To them, authenticity and pop are separate sides in an inexplicable and unwinnable musical cold war. They have attacked her professionally, accusing her of not writing her own songs, and personally, claiming she's had plastic surgery. ""My publicists, in their long career, say they have never seen someone be more fictionalised,"" sighs Del Rey. But the singer insists she's unfazed by the criticism. ""I know what people say about me and I'm not really that concerned, because those kind of problems I'm not really interested in. ""I'm concerned about the potential collapse of the euro, the state of the global economy. We have serious problems. ""Of course I hope the record does really well but, regardless of how things end up turning out, I'm not concerned about my future. I'll be OK."" Born To Die is released by Polydor in the UK on 30 January.","Lana Del Rey has been praised, sued and vilified - all before her album hits the shelves. But the US star says she's more concerned by the global financial crisis than her critics."

Jessie Eisenberg was named best actor as Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. British actress Olivia Williams picked up best supporting actress. She played the wife of a former Prime Minister in Roman Polanski's The Ghost. The Social Network is widely considered one of the front-runners for the Oscar nominations, which are announced on 25 January. Eisenberg beat off competition from Colin Firth for The King's Speech in the acting category but Firth's co-star Geoffrey Rush was named best supporting actor for playing a speech therapist who helped King George VI overcome a stammer. The National Society of Film Critics, which includes members from newspapers in Los Angeles, Boston, New York and Chicago criticised the US Classification & Ratings Administration for placing an R-rating on The King's Speech for the use of strong language in the film. The rating requires under-17s to be accompanied by an adult. The British Board of Film Classification lowered the rating of the film from 15 to 12A, after its UK distributors launched an appeal against the decision.

"Disney drama Saving Mr Banks, Her, starring Joaquin Phoenix, and Nebraska are also on the list. The AFI's choices come ahead of the Golden Globe nominations on Thursday as the film awards season gets under way. The creative teams behind the 10 movies will be honoured at an awards lunch in Los Angeles on 10 January. The other films to be selected were The Wolf of Wall Street, Captain Phillips, Inside Llewyn Davis and Fruitvale Station. The AFI list - which has no particular order - is the 14th to date and is chosen by critics, scholars, film artists and trustees of the organisation. It is regarded as an indicator of the films that will be in the running for best film at the Academy Awards. AFI president Bob Gazzale called the awards ""a moment for the most accomplished storytellers of 2013 to pause and be appreciated - not as competitors, but as a community. ""Acknowledging their collective contributions to America's rich cultural legacy is both AFI's national mandate - and our honour,"" he added. Films that have been touted as Oscar contenders but failed to make the AFI's cut include blockbuster The Butler and family drama August: Osage County. The Oscar nominations will be announced on 16 January, with the awards ceremony taking place in 2 March. Gravity, American Hustle and Her have already been named best film by critics' groups in the past week. American Hustle was announced as the winner at the New York Critics Circle, while their counterparts in Los Angeles split their decision between Gravity and Her. 12 Years a Slave has already won plaudits for British director Steve McQueen, who was named best film-maker by the New York Critics Circle. The AFI also selected its most significant television shows of the year, which included The Americans - making the top 10 for the first time - Breaking Bad, House of Cards and The Good Wife.

"They are angry about his advocacy of gun control, in the wake of the 14 December shootings in Connecticut. The petition followed an interview with Larry Pratt, director of Gun Owners of America, on CNN - in which Mr Morgan called his guest ""a dangerous man"". Petitions posted on the White House website only require 25,000 signatures to get a response from the government. The campaign was started by a journalist in Texas following Mr Morgan's CNN programme of 19 December. The petition says the talk show host ""is engaged in a hostile attack against the US Constitution by targeting the Second Amendment"", which protects an individual's right to own guns. ""We demand that Mr Morgan be deported immediately for his effort to undermine the Bill of Rights and for exploiting his position as a national network television host to stage attacks against the rights of American citizens."" Mr Morgan has responded, repeatedly, on his Twitter account. ""If I do get deported from America for wanting fewer gun murders, are there any other countries that will have me?"" the 47-year-old joked after the 25,000-signature threshold was passed. He added: ""Wanting America to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines isn't anti-constitutional - it's called 'common sense.'"" Later he said, in a reference to the Constitution's guarantee of freedom of speech: ""Ironic US gun rights campaign to deport me for 'attacking Second Amendment rights' - is my opinion not protected under 1st Amendment rights?"" In the wake of the shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, President Obama has vowed to push for immediate and concrete gun safety proposals. But the pro-gun National Rifle Association (NRA), which has more than four million members, has rejected the need for tighter gun control. According to the Small Arms Survey, there were 88.8 firearms for every 100 Americans in 2007. 'Stupid man' Mr Morgan's interview, on his nightly chat show, came five days after gunman Adam Lanza killed 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary school. Mr Pratt said tighter controls on gun sales would not put an end to similar tragedies. ""The problem occurs in those areas precisely where we have said 'no guns',"" he said. ""Where the guns are allowed freely to be carried... we have very low murder rates. ""We only have problems in our cities and, unhappily, in our schools, where people like you have been able to get laws put on the books that keep people from being able to defend themselves."" Mr Morgan responded: ""You're a very stupid man, aren't you? ""You have absolutely no coherent argument. You don't actually give a damn about the gun murder rate in America."" He ended the combative interview by calling Mr Pratt ""a dangerous man espousing dangerous nonsense"" and declared, ""you shame your country"".","More than 31,000 Americans have signed a petition calling for British TV host Piers Morgan to be deported."
"Will GompertzArts editor@WillGompertzBBCon Twitter You know this story, you know this person. If you're like me, it was you. Or, is you. Or, your brother. Or, one of your friends, or one of your children, or one of your friend's children, or one of your children's friends. He is the Everyman in the male coming-of-age saga: a troubled, confused, angry, depressed, fragile dude looking for some direction and purpose - not that he'd ever admit it. There's a journey to be taken and that's the basis of the movie/book/play/song etc. And so it is with The King of Staten Island, a 135-minute easy-paced film directed by Judd Apatow, now available on-demand. It is not genre-busting, or genre-defining, or genre-bending - it is a middle-of-the-road genre staple. Except for one thing… Pete Davidson. Pete Davidson is the movie's star. He isn't middle-of-the-road. He's speeding along the charisma super-highway, turning heads with what looks like an old banger act but is in fact a finely-tuned, custom-made performance that not only brings the film alive, but gives it a heart and a soul. Whatever way you look at it, The King of Staten Island is his film. Or put another way, Pete Davidson is The King of Staten Island. The comedian and Saturday Night Live regular plays the lead role, he gives the stand-out performance, he co-wrote the script, and he has an executive producer credit. He was even born in Staten Island and still lives there, for goodness sake. And that's not all. Davidson plays Scott Carlin, a drifting 24-year old wannabe tattoo artist who has yet to come to terms with the death of his firefighter father, killed in the line of duty when our pot-head protagonist was a boy. Scott's mental health is poor. He smokes too many joints, he lives with his mum, and he has chronic gut issues. It is a biography that reads very close to Davidson's own life story (his firefighter father, also called Scott, died trying to save others as a 9/11 first responder). Not exactly a stretch for Davidson the actor, then. I imagine there weren't a lot of ""Hey, Judd, what's my motivation?"" type conversations between lead actor and director. But, maybe, playing a fictional role largely based on your own back story is far harder than taking on the role of a totally different character altogether. Pete Davidson is not Scott Carlin in the way that Larry David is a heightened version of himself in Curb Your Enthusiasm. And yet, anybody who knows Davidson's stand-up work will see similar traits: the low-status schtick, the poking fun but not being mean - or being mean and then apologising afterwards. The dry delivery, the ill-fitting clothes, the off-beat persona. These characteristics are all evident in Scott Carlin, too, but somehow Davidson manages to shape him in such a way that the fictional character becomes so vivid it obscures the identity of the man playing him. That's not an easy trick to pull off. Davidson does it with plenty of help from his friends. Fellow stand-up comic Bill Burr plays Ray Bishop, a straight-talking, shirt-tucked-in kinda guy, who provides a nicely weighted counter-point to Scott and his haphazard lifestyle. Ray has eyes for Margie (the excellent Marisa Tomei), the long-suffering mother of Scott and his preppy younger sister Claire (Maude Apatow). That's one love story. The other is between Scott and his girlfriend Kelsey, a young woman hell-bent on putting Staten Island on the hipster map. She is played by the British actress Bel Powley, who was one of the few good things about Apple TV's The Morning Show (buckle up, there's a second season on the way). She doesn't have many scenes, but those she is in are some of the best in the movie - there'll be an Oscar on her shelf one of these days. There is also a very welcome cameo-plus from Steve Buscemi as Papa the fire chief, and a short but memorable appearance by Machine Gun Kelly in the guise of a tattoo shop owner. Judd Apatow does a good job keeping all the moving parts in order, although the pace could be a bit slow for some. It wasn't a problem for me, it's not as if there's a whole load to do right now. What's more, you sense a looseness that allowed the actors room to explore and improvise, which gives the film an edge it might otherwise lack. It also affords the viewer a chance to reflect while watching. And when you do, it becomes apparent The King of Staten Island is more than a run-of-the-mill genre movie. It is a brutally honest, first-person account of what can happen to a family when tragedy strikes. It's not hyperbolic or overly-dramatic. It's just sad and downbeat at times. It is not a new story, but it is well told. And Pete Davidson is always worth watching. Recent reviews by Will Gompertz Follow Will Gompertz on Twitter","On the face of it The King of Staten Island tells a tale so familiar it's a cliché. A young man is struggling to come to terms with adult life. He smokes a lot of weed, hangs out with a crew of equally lost souls, and starts making some ill-advised life decisions. He's not an inherently bad lad: he loves his mum, he's nice to kids (mostly), and routinely disarms with his self-deprecating charms."

"Almost 5.9 million people visited the Tate Modern art gallery last year, new figures show - just above the 5.8 million who went to the British Museum. Elsewhere, an exhibition of Terracotta Warriors helped visitor numbers to Liverpool's World Museum jump by 111%. That made it the most-visited English museum outside London in 2018. According to the Association of Leading Visitor Attractions (Alva), the World Museum was visited by 1.4 million people in 2018 - 610,000 of whom saw the ancient Chinese statues. It was 23rd on the overall national list, above Tate Britain and London Zoo. Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery also saw a big rise, thanks partly to the visit by ""Dippy"" the Diplodocus. The replica dinosaur skeleton was in Birmingham for five months as part of its three-year tour from the Natural History Museum. Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery welcomed 832,000 people in 2018 - up 38% on the previous year. The new branch of the V&A in Dundee received 341,265 visits between its opening in September and the end of the year. Tate Modern, which staged blockbuster exhibitions by Picasso and Modigliani last year, is top of the overall list for the first time since it opened in 2000. Despite the overall rise in visitor numbers, some outdoor attractions had a dip - mostly blamed on the extreme cold spell early in the year. The country's second most popular garden, RHS Garden Wisley in Surrey saw its visitor numbers drop by more than 70,000. The Eden Project in Cornwall; ZSL Whipsnade Zoo, Bedfordshire; Blenheim Palace, Oxfordshire; and Chatsworth House, Derbyshire also all saw a drop in visits. ""I wish tourism was slightly more sophisticated, but weather has always been a determining factor on where people go,"" said Alva director Bernard Donoghue. Alva also said the World Cup period had also led to a fall in visitors to some attractions. Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

"By Mark SavageBBC News entertainment reporter It's three days after her TV comeback on The Voice, and the feeling in her camp is that it all went to plan, largely thanks to that daredevil entrance. ""I thought about swan diving into this interview but it wouldn't have had the same impact,"" she laughs. The singer also brushes off criticism that she lip-synced her single, Call My Name, on the show. ""If you think my live vocal sounds so good it must be mimed, I'm happy,"" she says. ""I take it as a compliment."" 'Best work' The 28-year-old has another reason to be cheerful. She is about to release her third album, A Million Lights, after 18 months away from music. ""It's been a long time coming,"" she says, ""But I think it's the best work I've done"". The new material is the first she's recorded since divorcing footballer Ashley Cole, and marks her return to the public eye after being very publicly dropped from the US X Factor last year. In places, A Million Lights is immeasurably sad, soaked with tear-stained references to broken hearts and shattered self-esteem. ""You broke me down. Do I even exist?"" she asks on Screw You, an otherwise vitriolic kiss-off to a former lover. In the song's introduction, Cheryl cries ""love is so lonely"" - sounding simultaneously strong, vulnerable and grief-stricken. It is the best vocal performance of her career. Yet Cheryl did not write the song. In fact, she only has two credits amongst the album's 11 tracks. ""But you have to connect with something you're singing about,"" she counters. ""I'm not going to sing about a subject I've not got any feeling for."" Fans will recognise those quotes. They are the star's rote answers when asked to explain her lyrics. Despite further prompts in this interview, she avoids going deeper into the album's more despondent moments. What she will say, however, is that she deliberately withheld some songs from the record because they were too close to the bone. ""Every record I've made, there are songs I've written that I haven't put out because... well, I don't want to. I write for my own pleasure sometimes."" So how does one arrive at such a deeply personal record with so little creative input? Cheryl says it's all about auditioning songs and choosing the ones that reflect her feelings. ""I get sent a lot of tracks where there'll just be a beat, or a chorus,"" she explains. ""Sometimes I think, 'that chorus is amazing' and I'll write a verse to it, or someone else will write a verse to it."" Other times, she says, a song arrives fully formed. That was the case with the flirtatious Ghetto Baby - which was emailed to her out of the blue by a pre-fame Lana Del Rey. ""I kept getting notes with songs saying, 'this track is amazing, you need to hear this' and I would listen to them and think [ pulls face], 'that's not for me. I don't really like that one'. ""And then I got a really blase message with this track. It just said, 'you might want to listen to this, tell us what you think'. ""So I put the song on and I was like, 'is this email a joke? This song is incredible and I need it.'"" Tummy troubles So despite the lack of writing credits, A Million Lights is covered in Cheryl's fingerprints. She admits the year-long recording process was a big departure from her previous work. ""With Girls Aloud, Brian [Higgins, producer] had a very unique way of recording. We'd all just be hanging out in a lounge while another girl went out to record six, seven songs. Then the next girl... and the next girl. ""Then he'd go through every vocal and choose which one sat best in every part of the song. We wouldn't know how it was going to sound until he delivered it - which was actually quite fun."" Cheryl was often pushed to reach high notes when recording with the girl band - but her solo material more often utilizes the middle of her mezzo-soprano range. ""I'm more comfortable singing in a lower register,"" she says. ""I think that could be due to the fact that all I grew up listening to was male soul music."" But there could be another, less artistic, reason. ""There's a track on the Super Deluxe edition of the album called Teddy Bear. When we were recording it, I just sat eating Oreo Cookies and Pinkberry frozen yoghurt, and In and Out Burger all day. ""I was singing in the morning and everything was fine. Then I went in after having a burger and I was singing [ exaggerated Batman growl] down there. ""You have to use your stomach when you sing. If it's digesting, it's not a happy place to be."" Tummy troubles aside, Cheryl says A Million Lights is ""the most fun I've ever had"" recording an album. She has been teasing fans with lyrics on Twitter, a medium perfectly suited to her feisty personality. ""Don't believe everything you read... except what you read here,"" read her profile when she signed up in July 2011. She has since used the site to quash rumours and dress down her critics - most famously taking rapper MC Harvey to task after he claimed to have had a relationship with her (their dispute is now the subject of a libel action). ""I don't know what I was doing before Twitter, I really don't,"" Cheryl says. ""Burying my head in the sand. ""I never answer back unprovoked... But I'm always answering something back. ""I don't have any middle-men now. I've got my voice back."" Call My Name is out on 9 June. A Million Lights follows on 18 June.",Cheryl - the artist formerly known as Cheryl Cole and formerly formerly known as Cheryl Tweedy - is in high spirits.
"By Mark SavageBBC music reporter The story goes that Prince came up with the opening lines - ""I guess I should have known, by the way you parked your car sideways, that it wouldn't last"" - after falling asleep in the back of a car owned by his keyboard player Lisa Coleman. And that's true... to an extent. The BBC got the full story behind the song, and some of Prince's other hits, directly from Coleman and her musical partner in crime, Wendy Melvoin. They were perhaps Prince's most important musical collaborators, working solidly with him throughout the early '80s as members of The Revolution, introducing elements of jazz and classical to his provocative blend of funk and rock. After he dismissed the band in 1986, Wendy and Lisa released several successful albums as a duo and went on to score hit TV shows like Nurse Jackie and Heroes. They're currently working on an album with comedian Maya Rudolph and celebrating Prince's legacy by reforming the original line-up of The Revolution. The duo reminisced about their favourite Revolution songs ahead of the release of a deluxe edition of Prince's fifth studio album, 1999, this Friday, containing 35 previously unreleased songs. LITTLE RED CORVETTE Lisa: ""Prince was always borrowing my car because it was awesome. It was a '64 Mercury Montclair, pink and white, and it was just the perfect cruise-mobile on a beautiful day in Minneapolis. He actually put a couple of dents in it, because it was so big. He'd come up to me and mumble, 'Hey Lisa, sorry about your car'. So I'd run out to inspect the damage and there'd be a little dent with some yellow paint from a pole he'd reversed into, and I'd go, 'Damn it. Watch where you're going!'"" Is it true he wrote Little Red Corvette while he was sleeping in the back of the car? ""Well... I guess. He was 'sleeping' with someone we knew called Denise Matthews [aka Vanity] and she was 'sleeping' in the back of the car, too. I even found some of her hair wrapped around the handle that winds the window down. ""So I imagine they were making out, or doing whatever, in the back seat and they probably had a wonderful moment of afterglow, which is when he got the seed of the idea... But it's not a red Corvette, it's a pink Mercury!"" The song became his mainstream breakthrough. Did you know it was special? ""Yeah, definitely. It was pure hit material and Prince coveted it for a little while. ""Before it was recorded, we'd play it in sound check and our manager Steve [Fargnoli] would freak out. Prince used to laugh at him: 'Oh, Steve has babies when we play this song!'"" 1999 Lisa: ""I have a really clear memory of the first time I heard that song. I'd gone to rehearsal early, but Prince was already there playing the main keyboard riff. He motioned me to come over, and said, 'Play this', then he went down and picked up the guitar and started fooling around with it. Then, when everybody else started showing up, he showed them their parts and we all kind of fell in. ""I was in good favour that day, because I decided to hold down D and F in the chorus. He was like, 'Alright, that's great! Listen to Lisa, she's producing herself. Why don't the rest of you guys do that?' He was always nice and then he'd have to say something mean after. Like, 'I can support you but don't forget you're not all that.'"" You get to sing the first line of the song. How did that come about? ""Prince got the idea of splitting the vocals up from Sly & The Family Stone, and how everyone had a presence in that band. We actually added Jill Jones's voice because she's a better singer than I am. So it's the two of us singing together. I have the dreamy quality and she has the fire."" D.M.S.R. Lisa: ""I still love playing that song. I love the funk and the Minneapolis sound of it, with the Oberheim [synthesizers] and everything. It has a party vibe going all the way through."" The groove on that song is so persistent. You must play the main riff a couple of hundred times. ""Right, exactly. It's almost meditative. That was one of the great things about being in the Revolution. We were like whirling dervishes, because we would take a groove and play it for hours on end. It was not only good for training our bodies - but imagine what that did to our brains. There were times in these jams and rehearsals where I'd really feel elated. It was so good. You just become part of the music, there's no other way to explain it."" The lyrics are all about personal liberation and celebrating your sexuality, which was quite unusual in 1982. ""It was definitely out of phase. I was always proud of him because it wasn't in fashion to talk about those things back then. He had a vision about people, about how we could be together, and he managed to create an oasis in Paisley Park for people who heard the message."" AMERICA Guitarist Wendy Melvoin joined the Revolution in 1983, playing her first gig on the night Prince debuted Purple Rain. Lisa told the BBC about the creation of that song in a previous interview, so we skipped ahead to 1985, and the release of Prince's seventh album, Around The World In A Day. The record, which featured the hits Pop Life and Raspberry Beret, also contained a funk jam called America, which served as the ultimate showcase of The Revolution's musical muscle, especially on the unedited 21-minute version that appeared on the 12"" single. Lisa: ""The first time we played America was in a tent in the south of France, while we were filming Under The Cherry Moon."" Wendy: ""There was no ventilation and it was over 100 degrees in the tent. And if you've watched the video, you can see we are full-on running around the stage. I remember both Prince and I had to have oxygen tanks brought to us because we almost passed out from heat exhaustion."" Lisa: ""I remember Prince laying down on a road case and somebody brought him some orange juice. I mean, he was just dripping with sweat."" Wendy: ""He was wearing a trench coat!"" Prince is essentially conducting the band during that song, calling out changes on the fly, and even jumping on the drums at one point. How do you rehearse for something like that? Wendy: ""It's not an easy answer. We were good listeners, and we had worked on the groove for quite some time, so we knew what was expected of us. It was all basically just, 'Keep your eye on him', and he'd give us signals on where he wanted to go."" Lisa: ""Sometimes he'd come up to my keyboards and jam a little bit and say, 'Play something like that'. But in this case, he just gave me the lead line, so I have the most boring part!"" Wendy: ""Really? Is that line all you do?"" Lisa: ""Well, I sing my ass off."" Wendy: ""I'm busy up there. The guitar part's very intricate."" Lisa: ""Sometimes, when I got really easy parts I'd get mad at Prince and play with a yo-yo on stage, going, 'I'm bored!'"" SOMETIMES IT SNOWS IN APRIL Sometimes It Snows in April is the final track on Prince's second film, Under the Cherry Moon. It's an uncharacteristically spare and melancholy addition to the star's songbook, and deals with the passing of a beloved friend. After Prince died in April 2016, the song became his eulogy, and The Revolution regularly revisit it in concert. Wendy: ""We were at Sunset Sound in Los Angeles, Prince, me and Lisa, just the three of us, and we were all in quiet moods. I picked up an acoustic and Lisa was playing piano and we just started coming up with a motif, a progression. Prince is very quick with words, so it kind of just happened in a couple of hours. He'd written the whole lyric and sung the whole song. It came very fast."" Lisa: ""He pushed for that dissonant chord when he sings 'Sometimes I wish'. He called it the 'Lisa chord' but it was actually his harmony that made it dissonant. It's beautiful the way it resolves."" Wendy: ""It was a nice night. I remember being very, very calm. There was no drama of any kind."" There's a real fragility to that song. Wendy: ""There were a few around that time. Power Fantastic had a lot of tenderness, and so did The Tears In Your Eyes. They all had that same kind of gentle quietness."" Tell me more about the 'Lisa chord'. Wendy: ""I'll tell you one thing about Lisa: All of the musicians that Prince hired over the years, including me, he can do all of their parts. The only musician he ever hired that he can't mimic was Lisa. She became invaluable to him and I believe, truly, that Lisa was his ultimate musical muse. I've always felt that way and I stick to my guns on that one."" Lisa: ""Wow."" ALL MY DREAMS Prince was recording several potential albums, including the triple-disc Crystal Ball, when he suddenly called time on The Revolution. Bootlegs from those sessions have circulated amongst fans for years, and this All My Dreams is Wendy & Lisa's personal favourite. Wendy: ""I wish Lisa and I could get our hands on All My Dreams and finish it up for him."" Lisa: ""That was such an interesting, fun, crazy day in the studio. When you listen to it, it's like a little movie or something. It had a carnival atmosphere."" Wendy: ""Do you remember around that time we took him to see Kid Creole and the Coconuts and he fell in love with August Darnell singing through the megaphone? He made [studio engineer] Susan Rogers buy him one for that song."" Lisa: ""It's so full of imagination. He sings, 'Lisa, I'm going to give you the paintbrush and you're going to paint the side of the train'. What does that mean?! And then I do some crazy piano solo, just pounding around, and we were just like, ""Y'arr! This is great! This is just fantastic!'"" Wendy: ""I remember me and Lisa and my twin sister Susanna pulled out recorders we had from our school days, and Prince was like, 'Bring it on!' It was just a crazy time."" You're in a reverie remembering it. Wendy: ""Oh yeah, for sure. It was such a beautiful time of exploration."" Lisa: ""Sometimes the work was just work. But this? It was like kindergarten for songwriters. As musicians, as songwriters, we were a little bit nuts."" Why did Prince withdraw from that psychedelic style? Wendy: ""Because we were gone. And once we were gone, he turned into a different person. That's the nature of who he was."" Lisa: ""Prince always wanted to be great, so he needed to regroup and think, 'How do I reach the next level of my greatness? Is it a movie? Is it a different band?' He didn't know, but he had to find out - so it was like, 'Sorry, you guys. Too bad. See ya.'"" The deluxe edition of 1999 is released on Friday. Lisa Coleman's solo piano album, Collage, is out now.

"By Frances CroninBBC News entertainment reporter Over the years, the show has dominated entertainment headlines - and been blamed for ruining the music industry. But has it, to use the series' most-overwrought cliche, reached the end of its ""journey"", or is there enough talent and interest to keep it going for years to come? It's time to face the music: Six former contenders and music industry insiders share their views. ONE DIRECTION - The global superstars One Direction may be the biggest boyband in the world right now but they came only third in X Factor's 2010 series. Harry, Zayn, Liam, Niall and Louis all entered as individual singers but were thrust together by the judges. Teenagers at the time, the band grew up watching X Factor and, not surprisingly, believe the show can run and run. ""I think it's always going to have a fan base,"" Liam Payne told the BBC. ""It'll always be present - I mean for anything to last a decade is crazy"". Harry Styles agreed: ""It's mad, isn't it? For a talent show to last 10 years is crazy. I think it's got a couple of years left in it."" Louis Tomlinson pointed out that, while people like to sneer at the show, they're still tuning in. ""I think it's easy every year for people to be like 'urgh the X Factor - I wonder if they're going to do it this year?' but they're still talking about it and watching it and there's still talent every year"". CHICO SLIMANI - The novelty act Being on the show meant absolutely everything to me. It changed my life and my family's and, without it, I wouldn't be where I am today. I was on the second year of the X Factor, which became the blueprint for the rest of the series. You had real talent along with a few characters and novelty singers. They've tried to recreate that format every year, sometimes they're more successful than others. There is a good career and living to be made even if you are a novelty act on the show. It is a platform - I call it the conveyor belt syndrome - you're all moving around the conveyor belt and you get your one chance to make your mark. People who criticise the show and say it's ruining the music industry are talking absolute rubbish. One or two out of the 12 each year will be novelty singers and it is an entertainment show - but out of the 120 contests over the years there have been so many world class performers. They say it brings overnight success but often singers will have often put in an apprenticeship of many years before they get on the show. Who can deny last year's winner, James Arthur, should be a worldwide superstar? But that's only if he gets the machine and the right songs behind him. From the year I was on people I know are still gigging and starring in West End plays. I had a number one with Chico Time, appeared in Dancing on Ice and have made my own fitness DVD. I'm the one having the last laugh. FRASER MCALPINE - Music critic The influence of The X Factor has been most keenly felt among two groups: People who hate TV talent shows and wish to make this known, and people who would otherwise not have considered a career in pop music and have their fingers firmly crossed. It may be roundheads versus cavaliers for them, but when a new series starts, everyone else will either enjoy the spectacle, or start doing something else in a different room. Even in the charts, statistics don't support the idea that the TV reptile house is nurturing a suffocating legion of genetically modified superstars. Of the biggest names from the last 10 years in pop music - Rihanna, Adele, Beyonce, Lady Gaga - none have come from TV, and the performers that have taken their X appeal furthest - Girls Aloud, One Direction, Leona Lewis - have done so because they had a magic carpet of great songs to carry them aloft, once the cameras had started to focus on someone else. JEFF SMITH - Head of Music, BBC Radio 2 It isn't the must-see that it used to be but it does have a massive effect on radio stations, although more on the mainstream pop stations than Radio 2. Having said that, the repercussions have filtered into the world of ""timeless and melodic music"" that Radio 2 plays. We've solely supported Matt Cardle over the last couple of years. He was on a major label and has moved on, but his most recent record went into the top 20. Even One Direction get an occasional play on Radio 2, and I think their career shows how X Factor has supercharged things in terms of the UK's pure pop mainstream music. But on the whole, we've seen strong British artists arrive and develop in spite of the X Factor. There's still good music coming out of the UK that hasn't got anything to do with it. I was a teenager in the 1970s when two songwriters, Nicky Chinn and Mike Chapman, were the X Factor of their times - and Rak Records was the equivalent of Simon Cowell's Syco label. What Chinn and Chapman did with glam bands like Mud and Sweet was looked down on, but they sold an awful lot of records. Alongside that, you still had David Bowie and The Who and Led Zeppelin. These massive musical phenomena have an effect. Some people feel it taints things, but I don't think it does - it just adds to the whole experience of music. STEVE BROOKSTEIN - Winner of the first series It's 10 years ago and so much different now to when I was on it. I was the first and only older winner. I had a great time on the X Factor, it was a great experience and it was a lot of fun. But it's well known I fell out with Simon Cowell and the consequences were damaging. It changed my life in a way that I didn't expect. I didn't expect him to have so much power. I was doing better before the X Factor than after it. I had more work, better quality work. I wasn't ""well-known"" but I was on the wedding, corporate and private party circuit and at each gig I would get three more because of how good I was. But I never regret doing anything, because I look at my life now and I'm happily married with two kids and I wouldn't change that for the world. I'm doing a new album on an independent label. People liked my soul voice so they wanted me to do a soul album. I've got somebody funding it and they're respected in the music industry. He's a good guy and he wants me to do a good album. From the start, it always had the look of something that was going to take off and be massive. Mainly because the judges were so good and also because they got some good talent in there nice and early. I think it definitely lost its way when they started meddling with the format - when they started to do the arena auditions. For me, that ruined the progress from ""singer who no-one has ever even heard"" to ""someone who could sell millions of records"". I liked the way the [auditions] started in a room and I'm glad they're going back to that this year. I think Simon Cowell got too big for his boots, really, and he liked the idea of filling arenas with of people to watch him judging when really it kind of ruined the purity of the show - if there is such a thing. Simon Cowell never made any bones about it - he was just bringing to TV something that happened in the music industry anyway. Bands and artists have been manufactured since the day of the Beatles. So I don't think it's ruined the music industry. There's still plenty of decent music out there, it's just that there's just a lot more bland music, as well, thanks to Simon. I think they'll get another few more series out of it yet. The problem is now they're going to keep changing the judges every year because they feel they've got to keep it exciting. It's such a massive part of the ITV schedule that you've got to consider what they've got to replace it - and from what they've put out over the summer, they haven't got anything. In five years' time it'll probably disappear forever.","As Saturday night TV staple the X Factor returns for its tenth series, it has been revamped to try and boost falling ratings."
"Parker, who has faced recent media scrutiny over a historic rape trial, will be in London for the screening. The line-up also includes Oliver Stone's Snowden, about Edward Snowden, and La La Land, which has had rave reviews at the Venice Film Festival. A 780-seat pop-up cinema will be erected in Victoria Embankment Gardens. The festival will screen 245 feature films over 12 days from 5-16 October, including 18 world premieres. One film to be given its European premiere will be Manchester by the Sea, which is seen as one of the frontrunners for next year's Oscars. The family drama stars Casey Affleck and Michelle Williams. It has nothing to with the UK city, but is set in the small town of Manchester-by-the-Sea, Massachusetts. Other highlights will include: As previously announced, Ben Wheatley's Free Fire will be the closing night gala, while Amma Asante's A United Kingdom will open the festival. The festival will feature the UK premiere of Snowden, the Platoon and JFK director's dramatisation of the story of NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. La La Land, meanwhile, in which Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling pay homage to the golden age of Hollywood, will be in London on the back of its rapturous reception in Venice. It was described as ""a sun-drenched musical masterpiece"" by The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw, ""the most audacious big-screen musical in a long time"" by Variety's Owen Gleiberman and an ""an all-singing, all-dancing Oscars frontrunner"" by The Daily Telegraph's Robbie Collin. Nate Parker has acted in, written and directed The Birth of a Nation, a drama about Nat Turner's 1831 slave rebellion. With buzz about the film allied with headlines about Parker's past, it is bound to be one of the most keenly-watched premieres. Recent media attention has been focused on Parker's acquittal for rape in 1999 and his accuser's subsequent suicide. The Birth of a Nation will feature in Black Star, the British Film Institute's symposium to highlight the work of black actors. Festival director Clare Stewart said: ""For me it's one of the significant films of the year. In terms of Black Star, it's an incredibly important film.

"By Jody SabralBBC News And while being a novelist recently came out on top in a survey as one of the most desirable jobs to have, it is definitely not for the faint hearted. I now have an agent and an award, but it wasn't always that way. As a writer, the first step to securing a publishing deal is to acquire an agent, a middle-man, basically your number one fan who will shout about how good you are to publishers and hopefully persuade them to read your carefully-crafted novel. They are the gatekeepers to the publishing industry. Digital publishers, however, are changing the game because they talk directly to authors. This doesn't mean that manuscripts are of a lesser quality. It just means there are new ways of doing things. We live in a truly digital era, yet the digital publishing industry is still largely misunderstood. Digital publishers are often young, dynamic companies striving to find creative ways to win influence in the online retail market of fiction and non-fiction. They also compete with traditional print publishers to discover the next big idea. Being an avid Kindle reader, I was excited when I received the email from my agent explaining that a leading digital publisher wanted to take on my debut psychological thriller, I Never Lie. The editor and sales director fell in love with my protagonist instantly and hoped I would sign with them, this after the book didn't manage to find a home with traditional print houses. I had a mixed reaction to the offer. First, there was a huge relief, finally someone believed in my writing enough to invest and publish it. But then came the questions from friends and colleagues: ""Who's the publisher?"" The next question was: ""What's the advance?"" When I responded with, ""There isn't an advance,"" they reacted to my news with a muted excitability. I explained it was an ebook deal, and they looked at me with some perplexity. They also asked if it was self-publishing, and I explained that it was far from self-publishing, having gone down that route in the past. But it was as if I hadn't arrived in the world of publishing by securing a digital deal, which is ironic given how digital our lives have become. Digital publishers don't deal in advances. They deal in metadata and higher royalties. My publisher Canelo saw a gap in the market for high-quality ebooks where no digital edition was available and did quite well out of it, they are now investing in original high-quality commercial fiction. And, while this business model might not be good for bookshops, for authors it's pretty sweet - if the book sells. They offer up to 40% more royalties than traditional print houses. Okay, so your book won't be on the bookshelf in WHSmith, but as a first-time author, who cares? I wondered how on earth they would go about marketing the book given the snobbery I'd experienced in announcing I was going digital, but to my surprise my book logged position 140th in the overall Kindle charts two weeks after release date. It now has close to 100 reviews on Amazon. Working with a digital publisher I received the same support that any unpublished writer working with a print house would, especially in the area of marketing, which is the key difference between self-publishing and working with a team of dedicated professionals. I also get to set some of the rules. They sent me a questionnaire asking me what I expected. This can range from being in the top 10 to being recognised by other authors, and whether I wanted to make money or just sell it. The two are not the same thing apparently. If I'd said ""make money"" they would have set the price higher. As it was, my agent advised me to just get it out there so they priced it down because statistically most readers pick up a book by an unknown author if the book is priced low. It's the take-a-punt market. There are ways of measuring whether readers finish books too, interestingly. The PigeonHole for one, is an app that serialises books in staves. They release staves over a period of 10 days. Each stave is timed in terms of reading time. My book was released in staves that timed at 24 minutes. It means readers can plan to read a book on their commute or factor it into their day. The Pigeonhole said that at least 74% of those who signed up to read my book finished it. That's an incredibly powerful thing to know in the take-a-punt market. If readers are finishing the book, hopefully it generates reviews, which generates more interest and more sales. In my case, it was a unique experience being on an app with readers. I would wake up to text alerts every day with all kinds of theories spinning around because readers can highlight text and comment live. Libraries have also cottoned on to the digital readership and have developed apps where you can take out digital books. Readers say it can save on late fees because there's no book to return. As there was no physical book, I got creative for the book launch by recreating the crime scene from the opening chapters on London Fields. There was a forensics team. I baked a cake with my book cover on it. Passers-by wondered what on earth was going on so we handed out postcards of the cover including promo codes where they could go online and download the book for free, again to generate more interest. It made it into the local Hackney press. It was a book launch with a difference. It included performance art. I had little or no knowledge of the digital publishing industry before my book deal and it is still an uphill struggle for traditional print media to take ebooks seriously, but I have since come across many online platforms that have a dedicated online reading community. It's a curious new world and one that is presenting authors with new ways of working in the publishing industry. Of course, I still dream of one day seeing my book in WHSmith, but for now I'm a happy writer. My book is now an object out there in the world and once that happens, the possibilities are endless. Digital publishing: Five key tips 1. Do your research on the digital publisher. What are they looking for? Non-fiction? Fiction? Genre-fiction? Then read their submission guidelines and follow them closely. 2. Follow digital publishers who may be interested in your work on social media. They often put a call out for certain genres and hold open submissions. Plus you can always ask them for advice in this way. They do respond. 3. If you're dealing directly with a publisher make sure you employ a freelance editor to go over your manuscript. An agent will typically do this, so you need that second opinion on whether the manuscript is ready or not. 4. Work with them on the marketing. Maybe you you can get your book mentioned in your local newspaper? It's a start. 5. Get excited about the fact that you can now talk to publishers, but be realistic and don't give up your day job just yet.

"The broadcaster's director of television Kevin Lygo said the idea of an extra episode had been one of the first things he had ""wanted to explore"" when he took up the role in February. He said the move would be ""the next exciting chapter in Corrie's story"". It will see the soap's set expanded and more studios created on its 7.7 acre (3.1 hectare) Trafford site. The show currently uses four studios and its exterior set. Space for a ""further filming zone"" had been identified, an ITV spokeswoman said. She added that the plan would create employment opportunities and add ""a new and exciting dimension"" to filming the soap. ITV did not reveal the day or time of the sixth weekly broadcast.

"By Anna BaileyReporter, The Cultural Frontline, BBC World Service Images such as Olafur Eliasson's Solar Friend and Tomas Saraceno's Peacock Spider are among some of the works that can be displayed in your home - the only catch is they will not physically be there but can be seen virtually via an app on your smartphone. AR art is based on technology that brought us the popular mobile phone game Pokemon Go, and is being adapted by the likes of contemporary artists such as KAWS, Cao Fei and Judy Chicago. The idea is to enable viewers to get their art fix during the pandemic by positioning digital artworks onto surfaces inside and outside the home fusing sci-fi with reality. Danish-Icelandic artist Eliasson said: ""It's about fantasy. ""Having been restrained to my studio during these difficult times, it's about allowing yourself to be occupied with wonders. So put a rainbow over the kitchen table and a sun outside your main doors. We need some hope to look forward."" Daniel Birnbaum, director of the AR platform Acute Art said it is an ""intimate"" way of exploring art and having a relationship with it while galleries remain closed. ""The users become the curators of their own shows, like an art game and that's what makes it fun,"" he added. While AR art has been around for a few years, Birnbaum pointed out it is becoming more sophisticated, capturing the imagination of people during lockdown and particularly those who game and move in and out of the virtual and real worlds. ""I even know a few 70-year-olds who like this, along with 85-year-old Picasso connoisseurs!"" He explained that unlike VR ""you don't need a headset,' and it's developing very quickly"". ""Olafur Eliasson's AR work has reached more people than the Venice Biennale, so it's a new possibility,"" said Birnbaum, who recently launched the world's largest outdoor AR exhibition in London before offering it to people at home. Eliasson recently turned to AR after closing three exhibitions due to Covid-19. The environmental artist, who is celebrated for his tactile and physical works including his giant sun that lit up the Tate Modern art gallery, is moving into a virtual world of ""illusion and curiosities"". ""Having a sun in your living room, as absurd as it sounds, is very warming, quite literally!"" He said. Eliasson has been working with Hollywood film animators on a range of digital art images including a cloud that looks and sounds like it rains and an animated puffin that moves and turns its head. He points out the key challenge is to make the objects look real within the home environment. There are environmental benefits too, including ""no shipping or storage costs,"" and people can take photos of his works and share them with their friends. But rather than challenge the traditional gallery space he thinks AR will complement it. ""Soon you'll able to have a sculpture by Michelangelo in your house, a statue of David in your living room, and you might show it to your family and then say, ""let's go to Florence when Covid is over and see the real thing."" Argentinian artist Tomas Saraceno is using augmented reality to encourage people to tackle their fears by letting a giant spider loose in their homes. But rather than being creepy, Tomas hopes his eight-legged art friend will create a discussion about the extinction of spiders and how we can live harmoniously with them. Saraceno says spider art can be ""beautiful"", create an element of ""surprise"" and help to tackle arachnophobia. He has been working with doctors and psychologists in Germany alongside an online spider community, to pioneer new treatments to help people appreciate and reconnect with the natural world. But of course, virtual artworks still need to make money to function, and Kaws, one of the most recognised contemporary artists in the world, is one of the first to make money from augmented reality. Limited edition virtual sculptures of his artwork Companion (Expanded) sold for $10,000 (£7,100) each from an edition of 25, and now additional sculpture series of the cartoon character are going for $50,000 (£35,600) per copy, from an edition of 10. The former graffiti artist feels he is coming full circle. ""I'm really comfortable with ephemeral works and then you are left with photographs. I hope people see this as a turning point of how an exhibition can be experienced."" Multimedia artist Cao Fei is also no stranger to new technology, and has experimented with film, virtual reality, avatars and robots. Her AR piece The Eternal Wave features a lifelike image of her son lost in a computer game, exploring themes of isolation and loneliness. ""AR art is portable and sharable,"" she said. ""It gives the user the chance to recreate an artwork so it's growing and not static. ""As an artist you have to give up some control but when artists choose to use it, it opens up opportunities."" Feminist landscape artist and author Judy Chicago has been entertaining audiences with her colourful smoke sculptures since the late 1960s. Now AR users can launch and enjoy them from their own back gardens. Judy says that for her art is all about ""discovery"" and AR has the potential to ""democratise art like print-making"". Her smoke sculptures are available via Google Play and the App Store, and will be shown at Desert X in the Coachella Valley. Nina Chanel Abney launched her first AR piece, Imaginary Friend, to mark the 57th anniversary of the historical march on Washington, DC, where Martin Luther King Jr gave his ""I Have a Dream"" speech. The work premiered at the Lincoln Memorial to also coincide with the ""Get Your Knee Off Our Necks"" march, offering advice and spiritual guidance. The Chicago-born political artist said she wanted to give participants an ""always-ready companion"" particularly those suffering during challenging times. Another artist, Bjarne Melgaard, often described as the direct heir of Edvard Munch, has taken his bronze sculptures Octo with Ostrich Egg and Light Bulb Man and given them the AR treatment. ""I was surprised how much these old characters translated so well into a completely new medium, immaterialising them and taking them into a virtual world,"" said the Norwegian artist. London's Serpentine Lake in Hyde Park provided a much larger venue for augmented reality than a bath tub, when Christo and Jeanne-Claude's The London Mastaba became a floating hit in 2018. It will now become a permanent AR exhibit and a tribute to Christo who died last year. Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

"""It wasn't particularly surprising because it is something new,"" Jackson told the Hollywood Reporter . But he added: ""Ultimately, it is different in a positive way, especially for 3D, especially for epic films."" The 3D film has been shot at a rate of 48 frames per second, compared with the industry standard of 24 frames. The 10 minutes of unfinished footage, shown at the CinemaCon convention in Las Vegas last week, was criticised as uncinematic - with some detractors claiming it ""looked like a made-for-TV movie"". ""It does take you a while to get used to,"" admitted Jackson. ""Ten minutes is sort of marginal, it probably needed a little bit more. ""Another thing that I think is a factor is it's different to look at a bunch of clips - and some were fast-cutting, montage-style clips. This is a different experience than watching a character and story unfold."" Jackson told the Hollywood Reporter that he had no plans to shoot a trailer for the film using the same 48-frame-per-second technique. ""The 48 frames is something you should experience with the entire film. A two-and-a-half minute trailer isn't enough time to adjust to the immersive quality."" The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is the first chapter in Jackson's two-part adaptation of JRR Tolkien's fantasy classic. The two films were shot back-to-back in 3D, with the second part, The Hobbit: There and Back Again, due in cinemas in December 2013. Oscar-winning filmmaker Jackson believes the new filming format will take time for viewers to adjust to. But added: ""As another creative tool, I think it's a really important thing. ""Advocating that we have to stick with what we know, I think is a slightly narrow-minded way of looking at things when as an industry we are facing declining audiences. ""We have to find ways to make it more vibrant, more immersive - something that will encourage people to come back to the theatres for that experience.""",Director Peter Jackson claims to be unsurprised by the mixed reaction to footage from his long-anticipated film The Hobbit earlier this week.

"By Matt EverittBBC 6 Music News In an exclusive interview for BBC 6 Music, Metallica discuss their new album, Hardwired … to Self-Destruct. Eight years in the making, the 12-track record stretches to nearly 80 minutes and includes a tribute to Motorhead legend Lemmy on the song Murder One. ""We're still up there, man,"" frontman James Hetfield tells the BBC. ""As far as our look and our health, we're doing our best. We got grey hair but we've earned this stuff."" After the playback, the band decamped to Webster Hall for an intimate (by their standards) charity concert, playing songs from throughout their 35-year career, alongside new tracks Moth Into Flame and Hardwired. ""I don't know, eight years went by fast,"" Hetfield told the crowd at one point. ""But not for you, I guess."" The morning after the show, singer and guitarist James Hetfield, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett, and bassist Robert Trujillo sat down with BBC 6 Music's Matt Everitt to discuss the record. What's different about this album? Lars Ulrich: I'm still kind of tripping on the sonics. It just sounds really good and really rich and really full. The last record (2008's Death Magnetic), as it went along, it kept getting bigger and bigger. The songs got longer endings and that type of stuff. This record was quite different. The songs got tighter and leaner and a little more concise. So when I hear this, I feel this is Metallica at the leanest we've been for a while. Maybe even the leanest were capable of. How do you still summon up such aggression? Lars Ulrich: The old cliche is ""turn it up to 11"". I guess we turn it up to 12 or 13. But as I get a little older, I realise there's a slight element of getting into character. You're up on stage, you're in the moment, you're with your bandmates - and you turn into a little rock gnome or something. I'm not quite like that at 7:15 in the morning when I'm trying to get kid number three to finish his fruit bowl. James Hetfield: I've come to terms with it [aggression] being a part of me. I'm able to identify it and use it. Sharpen it at times, use it in the right places and otherwise you just shut the box on it for a while and try to be normal. Why did it take eight years? James Hetfield: Well, anything worthwhile takes work. You know, a marriage is tough enough but being married to three other guys in a band for 30-odd years? We're guys and we all have our own agenda - and we can be cynical about each other's agendas. We're creative, too, so we make up tons of stuff in our heads if we don't communicate. So communication is pretty huge. We love each other and we hate each other and sometimes it's really easy, sometimes it's really hard but it's always worth it. What are you addressing lyrically? James Hetfield: It's dealing with fame - and for everyone's that's their goal: ""I want to be famous!"" And there's also the topic of, ""Man, are we really doing this right?"" In the timeline of history, man has been around for a nanosecond and [I'm asking]: ""Are we done now? Have we had our time?"" There's a lot of polarization going on in the States, and I see it other places as well. But it just seems like you have to get more extreme to balance out the other extreme. We've got to find some balance in the middle here somewhere. We stay away from politics from religion. That just seems to polarize people even more. We all have our own beliefs but, at the end of the day, we're trying to connect with people and it seems like political views don't do that as much as music does. What do you think people's worst preconceptions of Metallica are? Lars Ulrich: That we live and breathe super heavy metal 24 hours a day, and that we have devil horns coming out of our foreheads. We're pretty chilled, normal dudes with a vast outlook on music from jazz to classical and pop to reggae. Metal is what we gravitate towards, and what we play. But most of us are borderline civilised people. Kirk Hammett: That we're unlistenable! You take a take a name like Metallica and it automatically brings up all sorts of suggestions. What I always say is: ""Give us a listen because we're not what you expect"". We're not a one trick pony and we take chances. Sometimes we fail miserably, sometimes we come out sparkling clean. It's all about it's all about the experience, really. How do you explain the band's longevity? Robert Trujillo: Each album you make, each body of music you just never know how the world's going to relate to it. And it seems that, right now, people are ready for some new Metallica and old Metallica. I mean, we're all over 50 - I'm 51 and I'm the young guy in the band - but I feel that when we put our instruments on we're like teenagers again. You know? There's this love for what we do. James Hetfield: We're still blown away by the fact we're still going, and that people like what we do. That's bizarre to me! Would you ever make an acoustic record? James Hetfield: I never say never on anything. In this band, we've done lots of things that we had no clue we'd even want to do - movies, and playing Antarctica and making an album with Lou Reed. So I never say never. We've got no agenda than just to play and have a good time. What does the future hold? Kirk Hammett: It doesn't feel like we're in the twilight of our career. From what I can gather, collectively, we still have a lot to say, music that we want to create and everything that comes in the wake of that. If I was just to stop now it would it would feel like coitus interruptus or something. I'm not finished yet! Finally, how hard are you rocking right now? James Hetfield: Well, my neck's a little sore from last night! There's a lot of myths in rock and roll - you're not allowed to grow up, you're not supposed to age. Yes, we are boys trapped in men's bodies but we accept where we are now. We got grey hair but we've earned this stuff. I've earned my silver. Robert Trujillo: I feel like we're rocking for the future. We haven't even played all these new songs but I'm already thinking of the next album.

"Tom McCarthy and Sunjeev Sahota are on the list alongside Pulitzer winner Anne Tyler and fellow US writer Hanya Yanagihara, plus Jamaican Marlon James and Nigeria's Chigozie Obioma. Australian author Richard Flanagan won last year's prize for his wartime novel The Narrow Road to the Deep North. The winner is announced on 13 October. The shortlist of authors and titles is as follows: At 28 years old, Obioma is the youngest nominee and has been shortlisted for his debut novel, while Marlon James is the first Jamaican-born author to be nominated for the prize. McCarthy is the only shortlisted author to have been nominated before, for C in 2010. This year's prize continues the policy introduced last year of allowing all authors writing in English, regardless of nationality, to be considered for the award. Before 2014, the prize - first presented in 1969 - was only open to authors from the UK and the Commonwealth, the Republic of Ireland and Zimbabwe. The chairman of the judges, Michael Wood, said: ""We are delighted by the diversity of the list but it is an accident. We were not looking for diversity. ""It suggests the novel is alive and well in different places."" Wood is joined on the 2015 panel of judges by Ellah Wakatama Allfrey, John Burnside, Sam Leith and Frances Osborne. The judges considered 156 books for this year's prize. Analysis by Tim Masters, arts reporter What a diverse list it is. Two authors from the UK, two from the US and one each from Jamaica and Nigeria. The ages of the authors range from 28 to 73. Debut novelist Chigozie Obioma is up against Anne Tyler, whose Spool of Blue Thread is her 20th novel. But, as some have noted, what unites the books is the grimness of their themes. The judges were asked about this at this morning's announcement at Man Booker HQ in London. ""They are pretty grim,"" admitted Michael Wood, chair of judges. ""There is a tremendous amount of violence."" Sam Leith added: ""Yes, they contain grim things but there isn't a single book that isn't touched with humour."" Wood said the discussions for the shortlist had lasted ""a morning and an afternoon"". ""The actual discussions were a joy. We had arguments that were violent but friendly."" The bookies' hot favourite is Hanya Yanagihara's A Little Life, the story of four college friends who have moved to New York seeking fame and fortune. If it stays on course, the Man Booker could have its first American winner in October. Jonathan Ruppin from Foyles bookseller said: ""It's very interesting to see that four of the six authors are non-white, beating 2013's record of three. ""It vindicates the opening up of the prize to all Anglophone writers, rather than just the antiquated category of the Commonwealth. English-language writing is a global phenomenon, blending a huge range of cultures, and the world's biggest literary award now reflects this far better."" The shortlisted authors each receive £2,500 and a specially bound edition of their book. The winner will receive a further cheque for £50,000.",A US Pulitzer Prize-winner and two British authors are among the six writers shortlisted for this year's Man Booker Prize.

Hearings have been held in both New York and London, but Madonna recently asked London's High Court to bring the English proceedings to a close. The pop star told the judge she wanted to ""heal the wounds"" opened by the dispute. Mr Justice MacDonald ruled on Monday the English proceedings could be halted. Rocco had lived with Madonna since her divorce from Guy Ritchie in 2008 - but he abruptly left his mother while on tour in Europe late last year. He then moved in with his father and step-mother, model Jacqui Ainsley, in London and enrolled in school. Madonna had accused Ritchie of ""illegally retaining"" the teenager. The case will now return to New York, where a judge ruled last December that Rocco should be returned to his mother's custody. That ruling was ignored - and Madonna's lawyers suggested Ritchie be arrested for contempt of court and compelled to appear in New York. State Supreme Court Justice Deborah Kaplan dismissed the plan, and implored the parents to reach an amicable solution. ""No one is disrupting his household other than the inability of the parents to reach a resolution,"" she said. ""If they cannot resolve this matter then eventually the court will."" She also scolded the couple for seeking to resolve the matter through the courts, and urged them to take ""this tremendous pressure"" off their son. ""Frankly, both parties here have chosen to live their lives in a very public way, and may welcome the exposure, but the child has not,"" she said. ""I urge them to consider what is the best interests of their son - which may be to remove him from the spotlight."" After the hearing in New York, Madonna's lawyers filed a motion at the family division of London's High Court under the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction. There, the judge echoed the words of his New York counterpart, urging Ritchie and Madonna to reach an ""amicable settlement"" to this ""highly unfortunate and deeply regrettable"" family dispute. Madonna later sought to withdraw her application. Judge Alistair MacDonald said he would consider the evidence before deciding whether he should allow English proceedings to draw to a close - or whether he should make decisions about Rocco's welfare. The court was told the affair had been upsetting for the teenager. ""Having this order over his head is stressful and upsetting to him,"" said Rocco's lawyer, Ellen Sigal. Handing down his ruling on Monday, the judge again appealed to the family to resolve their differences. ""At the root of these proceedings... is a temporary breakdown in trust,"" he said. ""For all the media coverage, comment and analysis, this is a case born out of circumstances that arise for countless separated parents the world over. ""I renew, one final time, my plea for the parents to seek, and to find, an amicable resolution to the dispute between them."" Neither Madonna nor Ritchie attended the hearing. Lawyers for the couple said they had both outlined proposals for negotiation.","Madonna has been granted permission to end the British legal action over the custody of her 15-year-old son, Rocco."
"By Ian YoungsEntertainment reporter, BBC News The list, which aims to showcase the best new acts for the year ahead, was compiled using tips from 213 UK-based critics, broadcasters and bloggers. Now in its 11th year, previous winners include Michael Kiwanuka, Jessie J, Adele, Mika, Ellie Goulding and Keane. BBC Radio 1 DJ Huw Stephens said Haim had a ""contagious enthusiasm"". ""Haim have an unapologetic passion for music that shines in their songs,"" he said. ""They're brilliant musicians who have a real talent for tunes that merge their tales of growing up in the 21st Century with a classic songwriting ability."" The sisters have already supported British artists Florence and the Machine and Mumford and Sons live. Este, Danielle and Alana Haim, who are aged between 21 and 26, started playing music as children when their parents enlisted them into a family covers band. The sisters all play guitar, drums and sing and are still occasionally known to pull their mother and father on stage. Haim's songs pay homage to feelgood, freewheeling '70s rock and anthemic '80s synth-pop, gaining a modern sheen by borrowing rhythms from contemporary R&B. The 213 tastemakers - ranging from music magazine editors and newspaper critics to influential bloggers, DJs and radio and TV producers - each named their favourite three new acts. They were free to choose performers from any country and any musical genre. Artists who had scored a UK top 20 single or album before 11 November 2012 were ineligible, as were those already well-known to the UK public - for example by featuring in the final stages of a TV talent show or already being a member of a successful band. The tips were compiled into a longlist of the top 15 artists, which was published in December, and the top five have been revealed this week. In second place were London R&B duo AlunaGeorge, with uncompromising New York-based rapper Angel Haze in third. Birmingham soul singer Laura Mvula was fourth and Glasgow electro-pop outfit Chvrches completed the top five. It is the first time that the top five acts have all been female or fronted by women. Este Haim said: ""It's the craziest thing to think we're on a list with so many amazing artists. This year the five bands that were in the list were all female fronted, right? ""We love the UK - the last time we were there, we were there for almost a month and a half. The UK is like a second home."" NME magazine's new music editor Matt Wilkinson, who took part in the poll, said Haim ""have a knack for writing amazingly catchy singles, they're a killer live band and they talk the talk miles better than most other new bands"". ""It's a rare and exciting combination,"" he added. Michael Kiwanuka was top of the Sound of 2012 list. The London troubadour sold 500,000 copies of his debut album Home Again around the world last year and was nominated for the Mercury Prize. The other previous winners are: Jessie J (Sound of 2011), Ellie Goulding (Sound of 2010), Little Boots (Sound of 2009), Adele (Sound of 2008), Mika (Sound of 2007), Corinne Bailey Rae (Sound of 2006), The Bravery (Sound of 2005), Keane (Sound of 2004) and 50 Cent (Sound of 2003). Other artists in the top five in previous years include Frank Ocean (Sound of 2012), The Vaccines (Sound of 2011), Marina and the Diamonds (Sound of 2010), Florence and the Machine (Sound of 2009), Foals (Sound of 2008) and Plan B (Sound of 2006).","Haim, a trio of Californian sisters who have been compared to Fleetwood Mac, have come top of the BBC Sound of 2013 new music list."
"The show is nominated for best drama, alongside Mad Men, Homeland, Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad and Boardwalk Empire. Downton stars Hugh Bonneville and Michelle Dockery are also up for best actor and best actress in a drama. The show won best mini-series in 2011 but will compete in the drama category at this year's ceremony. It faces stiff competition from Mad Men, which is up for its fifth best drama award. If it takes the prize, it will have won the title more times than any other show. The 1960s advertising drama is currently tied on four wins with Hill Street Blues, LA Law and The West Wing. The series has 17 nominations overall, as does American Horror Story, a nightmarish thriller about a haunted house. Downton Abbey is just behind, with 16 nominations. Six of those are in the acting categories, with Dame Maggie Smith, Joanne Froggatt, Brendan Coyle and Jim Carter all recognised for their roles. ""I'm gobsmacked,"" said Hugh Bonneville, who plays the Earl Of Grantham, partiarch to the Crawley family, on the hit show. There are also multiple nominations for mini-series Hemingway & Gellhorn, about the love affair between Ernest Hemingway and journalist Martha Gellhorn. The same applies to Hatfields & McCoys, which tells the story of a famous feud between two families in 18th Century America. Modern Family, which has been named best comedy series for the past two years, is the sitcom leader with 14 nominations. Its citations include four for its male cast members, all in the best supporting actor category. Actress Kathryn Joosten, who died last month, is nominated posthumously for her role in the final series of Desperate Housewives. Many of the big nominees - Mad Men's Jon Hamm, 30 Rock's Tina Fey and Dexter's Michael C Hall - are returning favourites. But newcomers include quirky sitcom New Girl, which sees nominations for its stars Zooey Deschanel and Max Greenfield. Shows making their debut in the shortlist include political satire Veep, CIA thriller Homeland and New York-based comedy Girls. There is a strong showing for British actors across the nominations. As well as the cast of Downton, there is a nod for Damian Lewis for his portrayal of Marine Sergeant Nicholas Brody in Homeland. Also recognised is Archie Panjabi, who plays the manipulative investigator Kalinda Sharma in legal series The Good Wife. Jared Harris receives a nomination for his role in Mad Men, while So You Think You Can Dance presenter Cat Deeley gets a mention as best host of a reality series. In the mini-series category, Benedict Cumberbatch, Idris Elba and Clive Owen are on the shortlist for Shortlist, Luther and Hemingway & Gellhorn respectively. They go up against Game Change star Woody Harrelson and Kevin Costner and Bill Paxton, both of whom are nominated for Hatfields & McCoys. Emma Thompson is nominated for best actress in a mini-series, for her role in The Song of Lunch. Her competitors are Julianne Moore, who played Sarah Palin in Game Change; Connie Britton for American Horror Story; Nicole Kidman for Hemingway & Gellhorn; and Ashley Judd for Missing. The BBC's Sherlock is up for 13 awards, including best supporting actor for Martin Freeman and outstanding writing for a mini-series. Show creator Steven Moffat is nominated for the latter for his work on the episode A Scandal in Belgravia. Ben Stephenson, BBC controller of drama commissioning, said: ""It's a testament to the quality and breadth of BBC drama that six different titles - Sherlock, Luther, Page Eight, Great Expectations, Song of Lunch and The Hour - have received twenty six prestigious Emmy nominations between them this year"" The ceremony will be held in Los Angeles on 23 September and will be hosted by Jimmy Kimmel. The talk show host also announced the nominees at Thursday's early morning press conference, stepping in at the last moment after Nick Offerman of Parks and Recreation was delayed. Taking to the stage in his pyjamas alongside actress Kerry Washington, Kimmel jokingly asked: ""Is this a sex dream?""",ITV1's period drama Downton Abbey is up for the main prize at the 2012 Primetime Emmys.
"The magazine said he was the first man to be included on the list because of his campaigning for women's rights. Bono said he was ""sure he didn't deserve it"" but the battle for gender equality couldn't be won ""unless men lead it along with women"". He is on a list that also includes Gwen Stefani, actress and campaigner Zendaya and Olympic gymnast Simone Biles. Bono said he was ""grateful"" for the honour and said men were ""largely responsible for the problem, so we have to be involved in the solutions"". But the magazine's decision has been heavily criticised on social media. Comedy writer Travon Free tweeted ""Does Glamour magazine know giving bono the Woman of the year award to trying to undo patriarchy undercuts the entire point of the award."" Another user named Stephanie Peat tweeted: ""Bono has been named Glamour's woman of the year. To be fair with only 3.7 billion women it must be tough to find a worthy one."" The magazine's editor-in-chief Cindi Leive said they had talked for years about including a man but had always ruled it out. But she said ""it started to seem that that might be an outdated way of looking at things"". ""There are so many men who really are doing wonderful things for women these days. Some men get it and Bono is one of those guys,"" she said. The honour comes after Bono and his One campaign launched a Poverty is Sexist movement last year. Leive said: ""The idea that a man who could select any cause in the world to call his own, or no cause at all, is choosing to work, and not just for one night or at a special event, but consistently day after day and month after month on behalf of women, is incredibly cool and absolutely deserves applause."" The decision has been supported by CNN's Christiane Amanpour, who has written an article in praise of her friend Bono for the magazine. She wrote: ""I'm on Glamour's side: I think Bono is the perfect choice for this first-time honor because, now 56, he's been trying to do good for as long as he's been making music. ""By establishing Poverty Is Sexist, Bono is making it clear that powerful men can, and should, take on these deep-rooted issues."" Also honoured as Glamour's Women of the Year are Patrisse Cullors, Opal Tometi and Alicia Garza, the founders of the Black Lives Matter movement; managing director of the International Monetary Fund Christine Lagarde; anti-Isis campaigner Nadia Murad; and plus-size model Ashley Graham. They are joined by fashion designer Miuccia Prada and the Stanford sexual assault case survivor whose witness impact statement went viral, who is known only as Emily Doe.

"Spoiler Alert - This article contains storylines from The Final Problem episode. Around 5.9m tuned in to watch Benedict Cumberbatch in The Final Problem, down from the 8.1m who watched the first episode on New Year's Day. However, consolidated figures from those who recorded the show and watched it later has bumped the figure to 9.5m. The BBC says it is investigating how the episode was leaked online before it was broadcast on TV. The last instalment of the fourth series was screened on BBC One on Sunday evening hours after a Russian language version emerged online. 'Full investigation' It featured a brief continuity announcement linking it to Russia's Channel One, which owns the rights to show Sherlock in Russia. A spokesman said: ""BBC Worldwide takes breaches or our stringent content security protocols very seriously and we have initiated a full investigation into how this leak occurred."" The Russian television channel claims it was the victim of hacking by ""an unauthorised external third party"". Channel One issued a statement saying they have been cooperating with BBC Worldwide's investigation. ""We are doing everything in our power to determine the source of the breach. Initial investigations suggest our content system was compromised by an unauthorised external third party. ""Channel One Russia will share the results of our investigation with the media as soon as it has concluded."" They also apologised ""for any inconvenience this leak has caused"". The series was the fourth outing for Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's famous detective, played by Cumberbatch, and starring Martin Freeman as Dr John Watson. Sherlock's nemesis Moriarty, played by Andrew Scott, made his return as part of a flashback sequence which saw him team up with Sherlock's secret sister, Eurus, before he died. Eurus, played by Sian Brooke, and Moriarty enticed the detective, Dr Watson and Sherlock's brother Mycroft into a series of games. Writer Steven Moffat has fuelled speculation that The Final Problem could be the last ever Sherlock. He said: ""We're not planning it to be (the final), but it might be. We could end it there. We couldn't have ended it on any of the previous series because they always ended in walloping great cliff-hangers, usually by Andrew."" The episode, which also featured a cameo appearance by singer Paul Weller, received mixed reviews from the critics. Michael Hogan wrote in the Daily Telegraph ""if this was the last-ever episode, which it surely won't be, it worked well as a sign-off"". ""Last night's episode showcased all the elements that have made this modern-day reinvention such a hit - as well as those that have proved divisive."" He gave it five stars and called it ""an exhilarating thrill-ride"". But Christopher Stevens in The Daily Mail gave it no stars and said that the episode was ""an abject, flailing, noxious mess"", ""shockingly bad"" and ""self-indulgent rubbish"". ""If you've woken up this morning with the angry feeling that you were robbed of an evening's entertainment, I share your sense of betrayal. Sherlock was, quite simply, the most nonsensical, verbose piece of television I've ever sat through,"" he wrote. More than 11 million viewers watched the episode broadcast on New Year's Day once consolidated figures were taken into account, making it the biggest audience of the festive period. The ratings for The Final Problem are likely to rise again when the on-demand audience is taken into account. The full consolidated ratings figures will be published next week.",The series finale of BBC One's Sherlock drew its lowest-ever overnight UK ratings on Sunday night.
"But he could have had even more. During his 60-year career, he claimed to have turned down several huge roles, including James Bond and Han Solo. Reynolds was eyed up as the replacement for Sean Connery's Bond, but told USA Today in 2015 that he turned down the part because he thought the public wouldn't accept an American 007. ""It was a stupid thing to say, I could've done it and I could've done it well,"" he said. He could have also been Han Solo in Star Wars, a part that was eventually played by Harrison Ford. Reynolds said in hindsight he regretted turning it down. He told Business Insider in 2016: ""I just didn't want to play that kind of role at the time."" If that's not enough, he also decided against starring alongside Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman, leaving the door open for Richard Gere. He also said John McClane in Die Hard wasn't for him either, with Bruce Willis eventually taking that role. Here are other actors who turned down some pretty stellar roles. 1. Leonardo DiCaprio - Brokeback Mountain Brokeback Mountain was met with critical acclaim and commercial success, but producers struggled to cast any major actors in the film. Before the movie went to Ang Lee to direct, another director, Gus Van Sant, had been working on the project in its early stages. Van Sant wanted big stars, but recently told IndieWire: ""Nobody wanted to do it. ""I asked the usual suspects: Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Ryan Phillippe. They all said no."" Producer and screenwriter Diana Ossana confirmed: ""Yes, all those young gentlemen turned down the project, for various reasons."" Heath Ledger eventually stepped up to the role of farmer Ennis and received an Oscar nomination and much praise for his performance. 2. John Lithgow - Batman John Lithgow as The Joker? It's not as crackpot as it appears - the star of The Crown was once in the frame to play the comic book supervillain. Correction: The lanky 71-year-old was actually tapped to play Batman's cackling nemesis TWICE - first in a Joe Dante movie that never got made, and again in Tim Burton's 1989 blockbuster. ""My worst audition was for Tim Burton for Batman,"" Lithgow revealed ahead of the Tony Awards in 2017. ""I tried to persuade him I was not right for the part, and I succeeded."" Jack Nicholson went on to play The Joker and ending up making a cool $100m (£78.5m) in profit participation. 3. Emma Watson - La La Land Emma Stone may have won an Oscar for La La Land, but it was another Emma who was originally attached to star in Damien Chazelle's Los Angeles-set romance alongside Whiplash's Miles Teller. ""There was a moment where Emma Watson and Miles Teller were doing it,"" the director revealed last year. ""Neither of those casting things wound up lasting or working out."" ""It's one of these frustrating things where names get attached to projects very early on as a way to build anticipation for something that's coming before anything is really actually agreed,"" is how Watson explained the situation in March last year. The Harry Potter actress still got a chance to sing and dance though, thanks to her role as Belle in Disney's Beauty and the Beast remake. 4. Sean Connery - The Lord of the Rings ""You shall not pass!"" bellows Gandalf in the first Lord of the Rings film. But Sir Sean Connery did indeed pass on the chance to play Tolkien's beardy wizard. ""I never understood it,"" Sir Sean has been quoted as saying. ""I read the book. I read the script. I saw the movie. I still don't understand it."" ""The films would have been very different if it had been Sean Connery,"" said Sir Ian McKellen, who ended up as Gandalf in The Fellowship of the Ring and got nominated for an Oscar for his efforts. ""Gandalf would have come from Scotland for a start!"" 5. Christina Applegate - Legally Blonde The role of Elle Woods in Legally Blonde suited Reese Witherspoon so well it's hard to believe she wasn't first choice. But no - a host of other actresses were considered before she came on board, among them Christina Applegate of Anchorman and Married with Children fame. Having played a scatty blonde in the latter TV show, Applegate passed - allowing Witherspoon to land the role for which she would be nominated for a Golden Globe. ""I got scared of kind of repeating myself,"" Christina revealed in 2015. ""What a stupid move that was, right?"" 6. John Travolta - Forrest Gump Life is like a box of chocolates - you never know what you're going to get. What few people know, though, is that we could have gotten John Travolta as Forrest Gump instead of the Oscar-winning Tom Hanks. Travolta was offered the title role in Robert Zemeckis's film, but he turned it down and ended up making Pulp Fiction instead. Gump and Pulp would eventually go up against each other at the 1995 Oscars, where Forrest won six awards compared to Fiction's one. 7. Warren Beatty - Kill Bill Quentin Tarantino may have secured Travolta's services for Pulp Fiction, but he was less successful at persuading Warren Beatty to take the title role in Kill Bill. Beatty had reservations about the amount of time Tarantino would spend shooting in China and withdrew from the project, enabling David Carradine to take on the part. ""I didn't want to leave my kids,"" is how Beatty explained his departure from QT's two-part opus on MTV's Happy Sad Confused podcast last year. ""Warren was a good choice and would have been wonderful in the movie,"" said Tarantino in 2004, insisting that ""there was no animosity"" over how the situation played out. 8. Will Smith - The Matrix Another actor Quentin Tarantino got a big fat no from was Will Smith, who was up for the title role in Django Unchained before Jamie Foxx. The one that really got away, though, was the role of Neo in The Matrix - a project Smith later claimed he would not have been right for anyway. ""The Matrix is a difficult concept to pitch,"" Smith told Wired in 2004. ""In the pitch, I just didn't see it. ""I watched Keanu's performance - and very rarely do I say this - but I would have messed it up. At that point I wasn't smart enough as an actor to let the movie be."" Will's wife Jada would go on to work with Reeves in the second and third films in the Matrix trilogy, while Keanu would work with their son Jaden in The Day The Earth Stood Still. 9. Julia Roberts - Shakespeare in Love Some years before it became an Oscar-winning film, Shakespeare in Love was all set to be a glossy vehicle for the star of Pretty Woman. Yet Roberts wanted Daniel Day-Lewis to be her Shakespeare, and when he turned the project down, so did she. ""Daniel wasn't interested, so Julia withdrew and the whole thing fell through just six weeks before filming was due to begin,"" revealed cast member Simon Callow in 2014. Gwyneth Paltrow would eventually win an Academy Award - and give a famously emotional acceptance speech - for playing the role Roberts turned down. 10. Nicolas Cage - The Wrestler Mickey Rourke was director Darren Aronofsky's first choice to play Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson - the over-the-hill subject of his 2008 film The Wrestler. Unfortunately Rourke was box office poison at the time, so Nicolas Cage was offered the role instead. But after accepting the part, Cage had second thoughts. ""The character is a wrestler who's in trouble because of steroids,"" he explained in 2009. ""It occurred to me I wasn't going to be able to achieve the look without resorting to steroids, which I would never do - so I resigned from the movie."" Aronofsky eventually got Rourke, who wound up with a Golden Globe, a Bafta and an Oscar nomination. A version of this feature was originally published in June 2017.

"Tarmey, 71, left the soap in 2010 after more than 30 years in the show. His family confirmed that he died in Tenerife, Spain, on Friday, and asked for ""privacy as they grieve for a wonderful husband, father and brother"". Liz Dawn, who played his on-screen wife Vera Duckworth, said: ""You couldn't wish to meet a more lovely man and a true gentleman."" A statement from Coronation Street said the cast, crew and production team were ""devastated"" to learn of his death. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with Bill's wife and soulmate Ali and their family at this very sad time,"" it said. Tarmey was married to his childhood sweetheart Alison for 50 years and they had two children. As well as suffering ill health himself, Tarmey eventually left Coronation Street to help care for his son Carl, who was battling a brain tumour. He told ITV Granada earlier this year: ""If this hadn't happened, they would've had to drag me out of there screaming. It was a wonderful bloody job, especially for an old coffin-dodger."" A life-long heavy smoker, Tarmey suffered a severe heart attack at just 35 while singing on stage and had heart surgery to bypass clogged arteries at 45, having the operation redone 15 years later. He also suffered from sleep apnoea, a condition that resulted in him jolting awake several times a night due to breathing problems. Liz Dawn, who played his nagging on-screen wife until 2008, said: ""I am totally bereft. He will always be remembered by everyone he came into contact with because he was such a kind and generous man."" For Tarmey's final appearance in the soap two years ago, Jack and Vera were reunited one last time when they appeared to dance together as a dying Jack drifted in and out of consciousness. Other co-stars have also been paying tribute. Kevin Kennedy, who played Curly Watts, said he was ""absolutely devastated"" and that Tarmey's death was ""like losing a member of the family"". Nigel Pivaro, who starred as Jack and Vera's wayward son Terry, described Tarmey as ""a very wise and dignified man who taught me a great deal"". William Roache, who has played Ken Barlow since the soap stated in 1960, praised Tarmey's ""amazing comic timing"" and said he was ""a genuinely warm and wonderful human being"". Vicky Entwistle, who appeared as Janice Battersby in the soap, said Tarmey would be missed by everyone who worked with him. ""He was just such a lovely man to have around,"" she said. ""So warm and always full of fun. The character of Jack was such a jack the lad, there was that wonderful mischievous side to him. He was so well loved by everyone - just a beautiful kind man. ""We all used to look up to him and learn from him and watch him because he made everything look so easy."" In 2010, Tarmey published his autobiography, Jack Duckworth And Me, which charted his life from growing up in the slums of Manchester through to working as a singer in local nightclubs before landing a role on the Street in 1979. He said: ""I've loved sharing my life with Jack. I'm not sure whether he has liked sharing his with me, though!"" Former co-star Jean Alexander, who played long-time Coronation Street resident Hilda Ogden, told the BBC Tarmey and Dawn were ""a really good team"". ""He certainly took to that part like a duck to water,"" she said as she recalled acting with him during his first scene in the soap's pub The Rovers Return. ""I was standing next to him on the set and we were just about to start this scene. He said 'Jean I've only ever done walk-ons. I'm terribly nervous, I'll forget what I've got to say.' ""I said 'No you won't Bill, just keep your mind still, open your mouth and the words will come out'. He soon got over that. ""And the part was so suitable for him personally. He was the right sort of character and the right sort of person to play it. I'm very sorry he's gone.""","Actor Bill Tarmey, who played Jack Duckworth in ITV soap opera Coronation Street, has died."
"Steve Dymond was found dead on 9 May a week after filming the show, during which he took a lie detector test. ITV's chief executive Carolyn McCall said the decision was a result of the ""gravity of recent events"". Following the announcement, a committee of MPs launched an inquiry into whether enough support is offered to guests on TV shows during and after filming. ITV's statement in full: ""Given the gravity of recent events we have decided to end production of The Jeremy Kyle Show. ""The Jeremy Kyle Show has had a loyal audience and has been made by a dedicated production team for 14 years, but now is the right time for the show to end. ""Everyone at ITV's thoughts and sympathies are with the family and friends of Steve Dymond. The previously announced review of the episode of the show is under way and will continue. ""ITV will continue to work with Jeremy Kyle on other projects."" Damian Collins MP, chair of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee, said the broadcaster had made the right decision. ""However, that should not be the end of the matter,"" he said. ""There needs to be an independent review of the duty of care TV companies have to participants in reality TV shows."" Programmes like The Jeremy Kyle Show risked ""putting people who might be vulnerable on to a public stage at a point in their lives when they are unable to foresee the consequences"", he said. The committee will question broadcasting executives and regulators. Love Island, another ITV show, has also come under scrutiny after the deaths of two former contestants. The Jeremy Kyle Show was the most popular programme in ITV's daytime schedule, with an average of one million viewers and a 22% audience share. More than 3,000 episodes have been broadcast since its debut in 2005. Following Mr Dymond's death, ITV initially took the show off air and suspended filming. The pre-recorded episode Mr Dymond took part in was based on the subject of infidelity. A member of the audience who was at the recording told BBC News that Mr Dymond ""collapsed to the ground"" and was ""sobbing"" when he failed the lie detector test. Lie detectors were a regular fixture on the programme, which often featured disputes between partners and family members. Broadcasting regulator Ofcom has told ITV to report back its initial findings on Mr Dymond's participation in the programme by Monday. ""While ITV has decided to cancel the programme, its investigation into what happened is continuing and we will review the findings carefully,"" an Ofcom spokesperson said. The watchdog is now examining whether to update its code of conduct to protect people taking part in reality and factual shows. ""We're examining whether more can be done to safeguard the welfare of those people, similar to the duty of care we have in the broadcasting code to protect under-18s,"" the spokesperson said. A lot has changed in 24 hours. Yesterday morning, ITV were minded to wait for the coroner's verdict before deciding what to do with the show. In the past 24 hours, the evidence has grown that his appearance on the show had a devastating impact on Steve Dymond. That evidence, and the fact that ITV is plastered across front pages once again, will have weighed heavily on the board's mind. The company's director of television Kevin Lygo has tried to reinvent the broadcaster, and this programme was an anomaly within his offering: different in tone and editorial approach. Nevertheless, it was a ratings hit, and much of its loyal audience will be despondent about it being pulled. For all that, it's vital to remember that this is ultimately an exceptionally sad story of a troubled individual who was found dead in his flat. Owen Jones, author of Chavs: The Demonization of the Working Class, was among those who welcomed the decision to pull the show, which he said ""consisted of putting vulnerable people from disadvantaged backgrounds in stocks to have eggs thrown at them"". Piers Morgan, who hosts Good Morning Britain - a show Jeremy Kyle has previously guest presented - defended the host on Twitter, saying there was ""so much snobbery an hypocrisy being spewed by his critics"". Former EastEnders actress Danniella Westbrook, who has appeared on The Jeremy Kyle Show, praised the care she was given. Appearing on Channel 5's Jeremy Vine Show, she said: ""If it wasn't for Jeremy Kyle I probably wouldn't be alive myself."" She added: ""They really have looked after me and you know, since I've been in rehab I've spoken to Jeremy all the time and [psychotherapist] Graham [Stanier] and the team, and went I went back on the show, reassessed and [I was] really looked after."" TV critic Emma Bullimore told BBC Radio 5 Live she was surprised by the speed of ITV's decision to cancel the show. 'A loyal audience' ""Usually these things take a review, and it's ages, but with this one the public opinion and the pressure they were under was so strong that they didn't really have another option,"" she said. ITV has said it will still work with the host, who also fronts The Kyle Files. ""I don't think this is the end of this kind of television,"" Bullimore added. ""There's no getting away from the fact that whether you like it or you find it reprehensible, there is a loyal audience for this show."" Speaking to BBC Radio 4's World At One programme, former ITV chief executive Stuart Prebble said the cancellation was ""a good decision"", but that producers ""do take seriously their duty of care"". 'Tip-toeing close to the edge' He said: ""The producers of these programmes walk a very thin line and and they know they do. If you are always tip-toeing close to the edge as I think this show did, perhaps it is not surprising that something like this will eventually happen. ""They [ITV] have done the right thing - a speedy and effective review, and the faster these things are dealt with the better."" All previous episodes of The Jeremy Kyle Show have been taken down from the channel's catch-up service, ITV Hub. Episodes will not air on ITV2 either, and the show's YouTube channel has been deleted. A spokeswoman for Portsmouth coroner's office said an inquest into Mr Dymond's death would be likely to be opened within the next few days, following the result of the post-mortem investigation. What does a lie detector test involve? The lie detectors used on The Jeremy Kyle show are supplied by a company called UK Lie Tests, which declined to comment to the BBC. A lie detector test, or polygraph test, involves an examiner using various instruments to measure the subject's reaction to a series of questions - and determine whether or not they are giving truthful answers. According to the British Polygraph Association (BPA), two convoluted rubber pneumograph tubes are placed around the subject's chest and abdomen to record breathing and movement. Sensors attached to the subject's fingers or hand monitor changes to skin resistance during the test, while a cardiosphygmograph traces changes to the subject's blood pressure and pulse. Various charts are then generated, which the examiner reviews to establish the test results. The BPA says the tests are ""the most reliable technique to test if someone is being deceptive to a specific issue"". However the results of lie detector tests are considered too unreliable for use in UK criminal trials.

"By Tim MastersEntertainment and arts correspondent, BBC News Smith, who has played the Time Lord since 2010, announced in June that he would be leaving in this year's Christmas special. The past few weeks has seen a flurry of newspaper stories guessing at who might take over in the Tardis. Early favourites included Harry Potter star Rupert Grint and Being Human actors Russell Tovey and Damien Molony. As in previous years, some have suggested the role may go to a black actor, with Luther star Idris Elba, Homeland's David Harewood and former rapper Ashley Walters among those mentioned. There have also been calls for a female Doctor, with Billie Piper, Olivia Colman and Dame Helen Mirren on some wish lists. Here are some of the names appearing in the bookmakers' lists of favourites. Peter Capaldi Peter Capaldi has become the late favourite to take over the role of the Time Lord from Matt Smith. The Scots actor, best known as foul-mouthed Malcolm Tucker in The Thick of It, is 6/4 favourite, according to bookmaker William Hill on Friday. Paddy Power has him at 7/4 favourite and Labrokes 11/8. Capaldi played Roman merchant Caecilius in 2008 Doctor Who adventure The Fires of Pompeii. At 55, as Metro points out, Capaldi is the same age as William Hartnell when he was cast in the role as the first Doctor in 1963. Ben Daniels Midlands-born Ben Daniels has enjoyed a long career in TV and film and on stage. The 49-year-old actor will be familiar to many through his role as Finn Bevan in BBC series Cutting It (2002-2005). Other TV appearances include political thriller The State Within (2006) and ITV drama Law & Order: UK. Daniels won an Laurence Olivier Award in 2001 for his performance in the Arthur Miller play All My Sons. Ladbrokes and Paddy Power give him odds of 4/1, and William Hill 5/1. Chiwetel Ejiofor Chiwetel Ejiofor's career has successfully embraced television, film and theatre. Speaking on the The Andrew Marr Show in 2011 he said he would be interested in the role of the Time Lord if it was offered. Coming to public attention with his role in Stephen Frears' Dirty Pretty Things in 2002, film roles have included Kinky Boots, Children of Men and American Gangster. Notable TV roles include The Shadow Line and Dancing on the Edge. Ejiofor is currently appearing on stage in A Season In The Congo at London's Young Vic. He won a Laurence Olivier Award for best actor as Othello in 2008. Paddy Power has the 36-year-old actor at 12/1. Idris Elba Idris Elba, star of TV detective series Luther, has said he's ""proud"" that people have linked him with roles such as Doctor Who and James Bond. He told Newsbeat in July the roles were ""national treasures"". But the 40-year-old Londoner, who shot to fame as drug lord Stringer Bell in HBO's The Wire, has also said of the idea of playing the Doctor: ""I'd look silly in a bow tie."" Elba portrays Nelson Mandela in the forthcoming film Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom. Other recent movie roles include Prometheus and Pacific Rim. Ladbrokes lists Elba at 12/1 while Paddy Power puts him at 25/1. David Harewood Homeland star David Harewood appeared in Doctor Who as Joshua Naismith in David Tennant's final two-part story The End of Time (2009-10). Speaking about being linked with the Doctor role, the 47-year-old actor told Entertainment Weekly: ""It's only rumours but it's amazing to be attached to such an iconic role. ""It would be extraordinary if the BBC were to make me the first black Doctor Who, it would be extraordinary. But I'm almost scared to make any comment whatsoever."" Harewood was appointed an MBE for services to drama in 2011. Ladbrokes has the actor at 10/1, while William Hill has 14/1 and Paddy Power 16/1. Rory Kinnear Rory Kinnear was tipped as an early favourite to replace Matt Smith in the Tardis, but has since ruled himself out of the race. ""I haven't been and I am totally certain that I will not be asked to be the next Doctor Who,"" he told The Independent in July. On Friday, Paddy Power had Kinnear as its third favourite at 6/1. His best-known big screen role is as MI6 officer Bill Tanner in the recent Bond films. On TV he is in BBC comedy Count Arthur Strong and imminent Channel 4 drama Southcliffe. Kinnear won rave reviews for his Iago (opposite Adrian Lester's Othello) at the National Theatre earlier this year. He has also written his first play, The Herd, which opens at London's Bush Theatre in September. Billie Piper Billie Piper is returning for this November's 50th anniversary Doctor Who special. She played Rose alongside both Christopher Eccleston and David Tennant's Doctors. Piper gained fame as a teenager when her 1998 single Because We Want To went to number one. Her acting career began with a part in BBC period drama The Canterbury Tales in 2003. She went on to star in ITV2's Secret Diary of a Call Girl and the BBC adaptation of Philip Pullman's The Ruby in the Smoke. Piper's most recent stage role was in Lucy Prebble's clinical drugs trial drama The Effect at the National Theatre, for which she earned an Olivier nomination. Piper is something of an outsider with the bookies. Paddy Power puts her at 33/1. Daniel Rigby Daniel Rigby, according to Ladbrokes, is the biggest mover and shaker in the betting, having been 20/1 a few days ago and now standing at 5/2. Rigby won a Bafta TV award in 2011 for his pitch-perfect portrayal of comedy legend Eric Morecambe in BBC Four biopic Eric and Ernie - beating off competition from Matt Smith (for Doctor Who) and Benedict Cumberbatch (Sherlock). The 30-year-old actor's stage work includes the hit play One Man, Two Guvnors, alongside James Corden, in the West End and on Broadway. Andrew Scott Andrew Scott won a Bafta in 2012 for his role as Jim Moriarty in BBC series Sherlock. The Dublin-born actor told website Flicks and the City in June that it was ""flattering"" to be mentioned as a potential Doctor. ""One has to wait to be asked,"" he said. ""I know Mr Moffat very well, so he'll keep his cards close to his chest."" Scott, whose stage work includes Emperor and Galilean at the National Theatre, is given 8/1 odds by Paddy Power and 10/1 from William Hill. Ben Whishaw Rory Kinnear's fellow Bond actor Ben Whishaw, who played Q in Skyfall, is 6/1 according to Ladbrokes, while William Hill has him at 12/1. Whishaw has also ruled himself out of becoming the next Doctor, telling the Daily Mail: ""It's not going to be me. But I don't mind - I don't think you can be Q and Doctor Who. It would be a bit wrong."" Whishaw, who appeared in BBC drama The Hour, was last seen onstage opposite Judi Dench in Peter and Alice at the Noel Coward theatre. He has just been announced in the cast of a West End revival of Jez Butterworth's Mojo, which will begin at the Harold Pinter Theatre in October. Doctor Who Live: The Next Doctor, is on BBC One at 7pm on 4 August.","Speculation is mounting over who will replace Matt Smith in Doctor Who, with the announcement due on Sunday ."
"Ness, who wrote A Monster Calls and the Chaos Walking trilogy, tweeted on Thursday that $1,018,000, or £659,755 had been raised for Save The Children. He started the campaign on 3 September, saying he was ""tired of just tweeting despair"" about the refugee crisis. Since then, numerous other authors and publishers have come on board to match donations from members of the public. Ness himself matched the first £10,000 of donations, and on Thursday said he had also ""donated the last amount to get us over a million bucks"". Authors including Philip Pullman, Suzanne Collins, Paula Hawkins, Cressida Cowell, Anthony Horowitz, Jojo Moyes, Francesca Simon, David Nicholls and Jessie Burton have each pledged £10,000 to match public donations. Publisher Egmont Press has put in £10,000, Penguin Random House has chipped in with £15,000 and Hachette UK has pledged £10,000 now and another £10,000 if and when the total reaches £1m. Soon after he began the campaign, Ness told The Bookseller: ""I am astonished at how people have responded. I think, by pure accident, I happened to express my frustration at the right moment.""",A campaign set up by author Patrick Ness to raise funds for Syrian refugees has raised more than $1m in one week.
"Tom Hooper's adaptation of the popular stage hit enjoyed the biggest ever UK opening for a movie musical, beating a record set by Mamma Mia! in 2008. The Abba-based stage-to-screen transfer took £5.2m in its opening weekend, with an extra £1.4m coming from previews. Internationally, Les Miserables has now taken more than $200m (£124.6m). ""It's fantastic to see Les Miserables become the top-grossing film at the UK box office,"" said Eric Fellner, of film company Working Title. ""We're incredibly proud that this film, like the stage play, is proving to be a truly global phenomenon."" Life of Pi, Ang Lee's 3D film of the Yann Martel novel, climbed one place to two, its weekend tally of £2.34m taking its overall UK and Ireland haul to almost £22m. Its takings exceeded those of crime caper Gangster Squad, a new entry at three with takings of £2.09m that included receipts from one day of previews. Last week's top movie, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, fell to four having sold £1.86m worth of tickets between Friday and Sunday. Les Miserables, however, has some way to go before rivalling the fantasy epic's total takings in the UK and Ireland, which currently stand at more than £48m. Based on the novel by Victor Hugo, Les Mis was named best musical or comedy at this weekend's Golden Globes, winning additional accolades for cast members Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway. Last week it was nominated for nine Baftas and eight Academy Awards. Rounding out the top five films at the UK and Ireland box office was the tsunami-drama The Impossible, starring Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor, which took £1.86m in its second week of release.","The Les Miserables film had box office tills singing a happy tune over the weekend, recording three-day takings of £8.13 million in the UK and Ireland."
"A number of designers have declared that they would refuse a request from America's future First Lady. But others, including Tommy Hilfiger, Thom Browne and now Gaultier, have said they would not have a problem. Asked whether he would dress Mrs Trump, Gaultier replied: ""Definitely. It's not my objective but why not?"" Speaking at the British Fashion Awards on Monday, the French designer said it was ""not a question of politics"". ""She dresses very well by herself,"" he told the Press Association. ""I have nothing bad to say against her. ""She was better dressed than Hillary [Clinton] when she went to vote. She was in her camel coat and white dress and was beautiful. ""I don't know who advises her or maybe it's herself, but if she asked me to dress her, why not?"" Last month Sophie Theallet published a letter on Twitter saying she would ""not participate in dressing or associate myself in any way with the next First Lady"". Theallet, one of current First Lady Michelle Obama's favourite designers, wrote: ""The rhetoric of racism, sexism and xenophobia unleashed by her husband's presidential campaign are incompatible with the shared values we live by."" 'A more respectful world' ""Personally, I'd rather put my energy into helping out those who will be hurt by Trump and his supporters,"" Marc Jacobs told WWD.com last month. Derek Lam concurred, saying he would ""rather concentrate my energies on efforts towards a more just, honourable and a mutually respectful world"". ""I was asked to dress her quite a few years ago and I declined,"" Tom Ford told US TV show The View. But that was less to do with politics and more to do with her style, he said, adding: ""She's not necessarily my image."" Tommy Hilfiger, however, offered a different viewpoint when asked about Theallet's letter. ""Melania is a very beautiful woman and I think any designer should be proud to dress her,"" he said.

"By Neil SmithEntertainment reporter The 40-year-old Moonlight star was speaking after she was awarded an OBE by the Queen at Buckingham Palace. ""I really don't think that they've moved on from Daniel,"" she said. ""I think there's a very good chance that Daniel will come back. I think it's way too early to be thinking about other people at this stage."" Harris, who received her OBE for services to drama, added: ""I think the fact that the last two Bonds - Spectre and Skyfall - have been the highest-grossing Bond movies of all time shows that people love him as Bond, and they desperately want him to return. ""And I don't think Daniel is immune to that... I think he's very aware, so I think that adds an extra level of pressure. But he has to ultimately do what feels right to him. ""But I know that we, as a cast, collectively want him back. I know that Barbara and Michael - our producers - desperately want him back, so I think the only person that needs persuading is Daniel."" She said collecting her award from the Queen was ""lovely"", adding that Her Majesty asked her what she was working on at the moment. In an earlier interview, Harris said that her OBE sent out ""a very powerful statement"" to young people from disadvantaged backgrounds. Harris was raised by a single parent in a north London council flat. ""As a black actress from the background I came from... I think it's incredibly important,"" she told the BBC. ""I'm absolutely thrilled to have my work recognised in this way."" Harris, who is up for a best supporting actress Oscar for playing a drug-addicted mother in Moonlight, was previously seen as Winnie Mandela in Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom. She is also known for playing Miss Moneypenny in the last two James Bond films. Film-maker Danny Boyle, who directed Harris in 28 Days Later and his stage version of Frankenstein, turned down a knighthood when he was offered one in 2012. Yet Harris said she never contemplated spurning the OBE she was awarded in the New Year Honours list. ""I know some people turn down honours for their own reasons,"" said the actress. ""But I was not going to turn down an OBE. ""I'm always interested in spreading positive images and being a positive role model as much as I can."" Born in 1976, Harris was raised by her mother Carmen, a former EastEnders scriptwriter who now works as a faith healer. Harris has no relationship with her father, who left her mother when she became pregnant at the age of 19. It's been quite a year already for Harris, whose performance in Moonlight has seen her nominated for a whole heap of honours. The Golden Globe and the Bafta may have gone elsewhere, but there's still an outside chance she could win an Oscar on Sunday for her role in Barry Jenkins' indie drama about a young black gay man growing up in Miami. To do so, though, she will have to beat bookies' favourite Viola Davis, whose performance in Fences has pipped hers in most of the awards ceremonies to date. Harris herself said after her investiture ceremony: ""I don't think I have a chance of winning at all,"" adding that it is ""incredible"" to be nominated. Then again, there's always a chance of an upset - as shown at the Baftas, when Lion's Dev Patel beat Moonlight's Mahershala Ali to the supporting actor award. An Oscar would be a remarkable conclusion to Harris' involvement in the film, given she shot her role in just three days and originally turned it down. She told The One Show last week: ""I've always wanted to portray positive images of black women and playing an addict didn't really fall into that."" Last month Harris was honoured at the London Critics' Circle Film Awards for a performance that also saw her in contention for a Screen Actors Guild prize. As far as she is concerned though, the honours, nominations and critical acclaim she and her colleagues have achieved have already done their job. ""Moonlight is about communities and characters that have been generally ignored in film, largely because people said they weren't profitable,"" she said. ""I hope people will look at the success of the film and realise there is an audience out there that is hungry to see these movies."" Moonlight is out on general release.

"By Neil SmithEntertainment reporter In a frank interview with Vulture, the 64-year-old pours scorn on the unidentified star for ""only giving people what they expect"". ""She even looks pretty much the same,"" the Body Heat star says of a mystery woman who is only referred to as a ""very famous Hollywood actress"". Speculation has been swirling over the identity of the woman she was talking about. Here are five possibilities, with the respective cases for and against. 1. Jennifer Aniston The case for: Turner worked with Aniston when she was cast as Chandler Bing's dad in Friends so is arguably in a better position that most to assess her career path. Aniston has had a variety of leading roles since Friends finished in 2004, though her most successful films (We're The Millers, Horrible Bosses) have been broad farces in a similarly comedic vein. The case against: Turner is asked later in the interview how she found the cast of Friends as actors and actresses and declines to comment. She also acknowledges she did not appear in the show for long in comments that suggest she saw the show's six-strong ensemble as more of a collective entity than a set of individuals. 2. Nicole Kidman The case for: With an estimated net worth of $130 million (£100 million), Australian actress Kidman certainly fits Turner's description as ""probably one of the richest women out there"". The case against: No one could accuse a performer who has variously portrayed a tubercular showgirl, a crazed taxidermist, a battered wife and Virginia Woolf of ""playing the same role."" 3. Gwyneth Paltrow The case for: Paltrow's Oscar-winning role in Shakespeare in Love came exactly 20 years ago, so it's just possible Turner might have had her in mind. Since then she's played a series of glamorous, capable types, not least the dependable Pepper Potts - a role she's played in six Marvel superhero movies to date. The case against: Like Kidman, Paltrow has not been averse to playing against type - notably in 2001's Shallow Hal, which saw her don extensive prosthetics in order to play a woman with weight issues. She has also taken a step back from acting in recent years, concentrating instead on raising her two children and running her lifestyle website Goop. 4. Julia Roberts The case for: Ever since her breakthrough role in 1990's Pretty Woman, Roberts has specialised in playing strong yet vulnerable women (often redheads) who smile through their tears. It's a familiar persona that has served her well and won her an Oscar. Yet it is also one that leaves her open to the charge that she essentially ""plays the same role"". Though actresses like Meryl Streep earn plaudits for their versatility and range, Roberts echoes an earlier tradition of leading ladies from Hollywood's so-called golden age. Like Joan Crawford and Bette Davis before her, she generally operates within limited but lucrative parameters that play to her strengths. The case against: Her tendency to play a certain type of role doesn't mean she hasn't ever stepped out of her comfort zone. Her more recent films, for example, include 2012 fantasy adventure Mirror Mirror, where she played an evil sorceress named Clementianna. She is also set to expand her CV by starring in her first ever television series - an adaptation of Maria Semple's novel Today Will Be Different for HBO. 5. Sandra Bullock The case for: Since making her name in 1994's Speed, Bullock has had most success playing modern variations of the archetypal screwball comedy heroine. Her penchant for high-concept romantic comedies, meanwhile, could be seen as ""giving people what they expect"". The case against: It would not be strictly accurate to say Bullock ""looks pretty much the same"" in everything she does, and she's certainly shown acting versatility. 2009's The Blind Side was one of her most notable and challenging roles, winning her a best actress Oscar. (It also saw her go blonde.) She also sported an atypical gamine crop in 2013's Gravity - a film she held together practically single-handedly as a character lost on her own in space.

"""You know if you don't want to entice a rapist, don't wear high heels so you can't run from him,"" she said, in an interview in the Sunday Times. The Pretenders singer, 63, said she takes ""full responsibility"" after she was sexually assaulted aged 21 in Ohio. ""If I'm walking around in my underwear and I'm drunk. Who else's fault can it be?"" Hynde told Krissi Murison. In her recently completed autobiography, Reckless, Hynde recounts how she was forced to perform sexual acts on members of an Ohio motorcycle gang who had promised to take her to a party, but instead took her to an abandoned house. ""Technically speaking, however you want to look at it, this was all my doing and I take full responsibility,"" said the singer, who recalled being high on drugs at the time. ""If I'm walking around and I'm very modestly dressed and I'm keeping to myself and someone attacks me, then I'd say that's his fault. But if I'm being very lairy and putting it about and being provocative, then you are enticing someone who's already unhinged - don't do that. Come on! That's just common sense."" ""I don't think I am saying anything controversial, am I?"" she concluded. Dismissive response But her comments were condemned by the charity Victim Support who said that victims ""should not blame themselves"". Lucy Hastings, director of Victim Support, said: ""Victims of sexual violence should never feel or be made to feel that they were responsible for the appalling crime they suffered - regardless of circumstances or factors which may have made them particularly vulnerable. ""They should not blame themselves or be blamed for failing to prevent an attack - often they will have been targeted by predatory offenders who are responsible for their actions."" The response on Twitter was equally dismissive. ""Chrissie Hynde has completely destroyed her feminist legacy in one ignorant, appalling statement"", tweeted Andrew. Dear Chrissie Hynde. NOTHING ever justifies the rape or sexual assault of a woman. It's the abusers fault only. Love. A Man"", tweeted Antony. ""Thing about rapists is that they're rapists. They don't care what victims wear. Their impulse is to rape. They're rapists. Chrissie Hynde"", wrote Jill. But there was also some sympathy. ""People criticising Chrissie Hynde for her comments are overlooking that she is a victim and this is self blame. I feel v sorry for her tbh"", tweeted Stephanie. While the Guardian's Hadley Freeman echoed her thoughts: ""Many people seem furious with Chrissie Hynde, and I get why, but I feel pity for her. Imagine blaming y/self for sthg so awful for so long.""",Singer Chrissie Hynde has come under fire for suggesting it can be a woman's fault if she is raped.
"Will GompertzArts editor@WillGompertzBBCon Twitter The crowd were expecting a big reveal not a distant flicker. All was not lost, though. A few moments later the digitised icon reappeared mid-stage in a splendid, golden evening gown and really looked the part. Any remaining scepticism among the fans was on the point of being dispelled. Nobody seemed to care that she was strangely elongated and a little passive; the quality of the illusion by its creators BASE Hologram was impressive. Almost believable, even. Until, that is, Digital Whitney went and blew it with her opening banter: ""Good evening to Whitney Houston very much live!"", she said, emphasising the word ""live"". That was a mistake. There is a place for irony, but Sheffield's City Hall at 20:45 on a wet winter Tuesday night isn't it. The audience, who had already invested plenty in their tickets (£40 - £70) and in the venue's bar, was not in the mood for being patronised with flippant remarks. Their intelligence had been insulted, the gauntlet had been laid down. Any prior willingness to suspend disbelief evaporated and was replaced by a mocking mischievousness. ""Live"" you say, well, let's see. That's when the heckles started. ""Blow me a kiss,"" one wag shouted. ""Get off!"" yelled another. They knew automated Whitney would have no response. They were showing her up for what she was: a pre-recorded fake. The show is bafflingly billed as an Evening with Whitney, which it obviously isn't. We all know she died in 2012. What it actually consists of, along with the technically excellent hologram, is digitally re-mastered recordings of Houston's vocals accompanied by a real band, some real backing singers, and a handful of real dancers, all of whom perform on a multi-level set. On occasion, as the show develops, the dancers and backing singers come further upstage to interact with the hologram, which has the paradoxical effect of bringing some life to a surprisingly passive show, while conversely accentuating the lifelessness of the technologically recreated star. It became obvious by the end of Saving All My Love for You, the second number, that Houston's holographic reincarnation was not going to do any justice to the singer's legacy as a live performer. The creepily detached digital Whitney in this show has more why-factor than X-factor. Maximising the financial potential of the back-catalogue will be one reason. CDs are not the future, streaming can be less lucrative, and juke-box musicals can lead to copyright hell. A theatrical show based around a hologram, on the other hand, can deliver a streamlined shared ""experience"" without having to fork out for actors, scriptwriters and fancy stage sets. But it does run the risk of appearing macabre and exploitative. Whatever happened to the notion of Rest in Peace? This is what runs through your mind as you watch an oddly green-faced projection of Whitney Houston, who was recently, posthumously, inducted into Rock and Roll's Hall of Fame. The pre-programmed moves of her on-stage avatar are horribly computerised, turning a performer who was once so full of life into a dead-eyed automaton from a 1990s sci-fi B-movie. I can't imagine this show winning over a whole new generation of fans, but classic recordings like I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me) and I'm Every Woman were enough to get some of the livelier audience members in Sheffield on their feet (to the disapproval of others who had come to quietly sit and listen). Houston's famous version of Dolly Parton's power ballad I Will Always Love You should have been a high point of the night but descended into satire as some karaoke-hardened ladies at the back of the room couldn't resist finishing off lines while holographic Whitney paused for emotional effect. A surreal night turned totally weird at one point during Run To You when Whitney was beamed back on to stage in a new costume with a massive video screen behind her featuring knobbly cloud forms with purple patches. I think it was attempting to conjure up a sense of ominous drama, but in fact made our star look like she was standing in the middle of a blueberry muffin. The show ended as abruptly as it started. There was no stamping of feet for an encore, no chants of ""Whitney, Whitney"". Instead, our Hologram host disappeared into the stage, waving to who knows who as she went, and that was it. House lights went up on a curious evening, in which most of the memorable live entertainment was provided by the audience. SET LIST: ACT 1 ACT 2 ACT 3 ENCORE Recent reviews by Will Gompertz Follow Will Gompertz on Twitter",The show didn't start well. The audience of largely middle-aged couples were palpably underwhelmed when the hotly anticipated hologram image of Whitney Houston first appeared briefly at the back of the stage as the real-life band struck up the opening notes of Higher Love.

"In previous years each country's jury and public votes were combined and announced in one go. Now the votes will be split with each country's jury vote cast first, and votes from viewers in all countries combined and announced at the end. Organisers say this will create a ""dramatic finish"" as the winner will only be revealed at the very end. In previous years the winner has been known for up to 20 minutes before the end of voting. ""This format change will inject a new level of excitement into the finish of the Eurovision Song Contest,"" said Martin Osterdahl, executive producer for this year's show. The new voting system is a ""big step forward"", according to Jon Ola Sand, executive supervisor of the Eurovision Song Contest, that will ""make a better television show as well as a more exciting competition"".

"Marc Weinstein used a fake press pass to get next to the stage for the historic New York show. The only other photographer present ran out of film during the gig. Weinstein's 61 black and white images with copyright fetched £30,680, compared with a pre-sale estimate of £15,000-£20,000, Omega Auctions said. Shea Stadium was The Beatles' biggest concert - and the biggest ever pop concert by any group up to that date. It came at the height of Beatlemania and the band's music was famously drowned out by the screams of the 55,000-strong crowd. Weinstein later recalled how he used a home-made press pass to con a policeman into escorting him to the stage area. ""I just blended with everybody there,"" he said. ""I had a method of operation; I just acted like I belonged. Anybody in authority, I would look the other way."" Auctioneer Paul Fairweather said the successful bidder was ""a South American gentleman currently living in Washington [who] is a huge collector of Beatles memorabilia"".

"He said he did not want to be a distraction and that he was ""sorry he had hurt people"". The choice of Hart for host was only announced on Tuesday. But tweets from a decade ago emerged of anti-gay slurs, sparking calls for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to drop him. Kevin Hart had said hosting the Oscars was ""a goal on my list for a long time"". But in a tweet late on Thursday he said he had chosen to step down ""because I do not want to be a distraction on a night that should be celebrated by so many amazing talented artists"". He said: ""I sincerely apologise to the LGBTQ community for my insensitive words of the past."" Comments Hart made during a comedy routine in 2010 have been put under the spotlight in recent days. ""One of my biggest fears is my son growing up and being gay. That's a fear,"" he told the audience. ""Keep in mind, I'm not homophobic, I have nothing against gay people, be happy. Do what you want to do. ""But me, being a heterosexual male, if I can prevent my son from being gay, I will."" In 2015, by which time his profile had risen significantly, Hart addressed the stand-up routine in question in an interview with Rolling Stone. ""I wouldn't tell that joke today, because when I said it, the times weren't as sensitive as they are now,"" he said. ""I think we love to make big deals out of things that aren't necessarily big deals, because we can."" 'Negative energy' When he revealed he would be the Oscars host earlier this week, Hart said it was the ""opportunity of a lifetime for me as a comedian"" and that his mother was ""smiling from ear to ear right now"". Earlier on Thursday it had appeared he would try to ride out the storm. In an Instagram post he spoke out against the ""negative energy"" of the criticism, saying people should ""stop searching for reasons to be angry."" He said he was almost 40 years old and was ""in love with the man I'm becoming"". In a later video, he said he had been called by the Academy and asked to apologise or another host would be found. ""I chose to pass. I passed on the apology,"" he said, repeating his assertion that the issue of the tweets had been addressed in the past. He appeared to later change his mind and issue an apology as he stood down. Parks and Recreation actor Billy Eichner welcomed the news on Twitter. ""As one of very few openly gay men in comedy who's fortunate enough to work as much as I do, I will always fight for my LGBTQ community to get the respect we deserve,"" he said. But others online expressed disappointment about Hart stepping down, including former Golden Globes host Ricky Gervais. Who might take over? Actress Busy Philipps wasted no time in suggesting she should host the ceremony instead. Failing that, she said, any female host would be preferable. The Oscars has been hosted by women before - such as Ellen DeGeneres and Anne Hathaway, who co-anchored with James Franco. Other suggestions put forward on social media included Daily Show host Trevor Noah, RuPaul, Justin Timberlake, and Tiffany Haddish and Maya Rudolph. But potential new hosts may be reluctant to take on the job. The role has thrown up problems for a number of past hosts and the Hollywood Reporter has called it ""the least wanted job in Hollywood"".

"By Steven McIntoshEntertainment reporter Hobbs & Shaw focuses on Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham's characters from the main series, and sees them team up to defeat a (literally bullet-proof) Idris Elba. The idea of giving Luke Hobbs and Deckard Shaw their own film came about thanks to some on-set improvising during the last film, explains the writer and creator of the new spin-off, Chris Morgan. ""It wasn't until [The Fate of the Furious], where we put them together in a prison, that we saw how well Jason and Dwayne bounced off each other,"" he tells BBC News. ""And really, we have so many takes of the things they would say to each other off the cuff that were so funny, [the chemistry] was kind of undeniable."" He adds: ""We've always wanted to expand the Fast universe, there's definitely more stories to be told there, stories that happened to these characters in between the major tent-pole adventures, and it just seems like Dwayne and Jason was the clear way to do it."" The ever-expanding world of Fast & Furious is evidence of its consistent power at the box office - collectively the movies have taken a worldwide total of more than $5bn (£3.82bn). There have been eight movies so far (nearly a third as many as there are James Bond films) since the first was released in 2001, with the ninth and 10th planned for release in the next two years. But, explained Johnson earlier this week: ""The plan has always been for the Fast and Furious universe to grow and expand."" The trailer suggests Hobbs & Shaw will have all the major hallmarks of the franchise, with action sequences including a chase which takes place literally down the side of a building. Hobbs and Shaw themselves are seen complaining about having to team up, but we suspect they'll find a way to get along in order to defeat Brixton, the villain played by Elba. ""The suit Brixton's wearing is bullet-proof, he is a slightly future-tech mercenary, a kind of augmented soldier,"" explains Morgan. ""And it was important for us, especially for this first outing for Hobbs and Shaw, to put them up against someone who is a real true challenge to them... so bad, so tough, so capable, that it would force them to team up."" Much of the new film was shot in the UK - as the film is partially set in London. But, Morgan explains, producers weren't able to shoot everything they needed there, which led to the cast and crew heading north to Glasgow. ""In London, we landed a helicopter on a street right outside St Paul's, we shot outside the Leadenhall building, but what you tend not to get a lot of is actual street to do a chase sequence - and that's where Scotland came to the rescue,"" he says. Later that same month, the shooting moved elsewhere in the UK - The Rock even dropped in to a gym in Doncaster while they were filming nearby. Film critic Rhianna Dhillon says part of the appeal of the Fast & Furious films is they have ""that pure, unadulterated escapism about them, children and adults alike are quite happy to watch things get blown up and smashed up. ""A lot of what drags movies like The Avengers down is the plot, and Fast & Furious isn't trying to compete with those heavy, convoluted storylines. This is just cars smashing into each other and it's okay to enjoy that."" However, the new film could signal a gentle change in direction with more focus on storytelling, according to Jeff Shell, chairman of Universal Filmed Entertainment Group. ""You can't keep having every movie have bigger and bigger stunts forever and ever and ever,"" he told Variety last year. ""We'll still have big stunts but... you have to really focus on the story."" In addition to the stunts and storytelling, another key part of the franchise's appeal the diversity of the cast. ""While the first three films followed the traditional white male hero narrative, the next four set about completely dismantling it,"" wrote Benjamin Rabinovich in Little White Lies. ""From 2009's Fast & Furious to 2015's Fast & Furious 7 [Paul Walker] is the only white male hero in a large, increasingly diverse crew comprising Korean, African-American, Israeli and Brazilian actors."" One thing Fast & Furious fans gently mock the series for is its focus on the importance of family - but that's an element Morgan says he's proud of. ""I know there's this drinking game that every time someone says 'family' in the Fast franchise everyone takes a drink - it's kind of a joke, but I would also say that every time these characters say that, they mean it,"" he says. ""There's an earnest quality in the Fast & Furious that kind of grounds the giant action that you see, because you care about the characters and like that they respect and love each other.""

"According to the case filed by Ellen Newlin Chase and Margaret Chase Perry, the show used their mother Ellen's lyrics without buying the rights. The show's characters have periodically sung a lullaby including the lyrics ""soft kitty, warm kitty"". Mrs Newlin's daughters have also sued other media companies over the issue. Calls to CBS and other companies named in the case were not immediately returned on Monday. Mrs Newlin died in 2004, having worked as a nursery school teacher in Alstead, New Hampshire, for about 35 years. Her daughters still live in the small town. The legal case claims that the ""soft kitty"" lyrics written by Mrs Newlin in the 1930s have been used in their entirety on at least eight episodes of the show since March 2008. Blog post It says the lyrics have also been used in merchandising, including on T-shirts, mouse pads, mobile phone covers, wallets, air fresheners, fridge magnets, toys and other products. ""The Soft Kitty lyrics are among the best-known and most popular aspects of `The Big Bang Theory,"" the claim states. ""They have become a signature and emblematic feature of the show and a central part of the show's promotion."" According to the claim, Ellen Newlin Chase discovered The Big Bang Theory's use of the lyrics in August 2014, when she was researching her mother's history for an article she was writing and came across a blog post discussing the use of the lyrics on the show. The lawsuit says that in 2007, Warner Bros. Entertainment and the show's other producers decided they wanted to use the lyrics and sought permission from Willis Music Co., a Kentucky-based company that had published them in a book called Songs for the Nursery School. But according to the claim, Willis Music gave permission to use the lyrics without consulting Mrs Newlin's heirs even though the book makes clear that Mrs Newlin was the author of and owned the copyright to the lyrics.","The daughters of a teacher who wrote a poem about a ""soft kitty"" are suing CBS, the network behind The Big Bang Theory, for copyright violation."
"By David SillitoArts Correspondent Over cucumber sandwiches at The Ritz with David Frost he had been offered a starring role in his new satirical TV programme, The Frost Report. Suddenly freed from his duties as Will Scarlett, it was Corbett's big break in TV and paired him up with another performer, Ronnie Barker. And why had Frost chosen Corbett? He had seen him in a show in a London nightclub with Danny La Rue. There, in one story, is one of the main reasons Ronnie Corbett was such a popular performer - acting, revue, the 1960s satire boom, music hall - he brought it all together at the right time and the right place in one five-foot-one performer. The Two Ronnies survived on the BBC because it had a breadth of comedy that gave it a startling breadth of appeal. Those '60s connections also helped - a number of those cocktail party sketches were written by Terry Jones and Michael Palin. The show's place at the heart of the Saturday night schedule meant it attracted the best writers. There's also another factor - I once met Ronnie Corbett in a lift in BBC Television Centre. He was a bit lost (something that happened to everyone at one time or another) and we went up and down more than once trying to work out where he had just come from. Meeting a childhood hero in a lift is always going to be a bit surreal, but what struck me was that he was entirely like the person I had seen on the television - he was good natured, self-deprecating and great company. Watching him in public you noticed how he seemed to arrive with a little aura of good cheer. Perhaps the height helped, but he didn't have to say much to lighten the mood and that ability to be charming and affable was perhaps a key reason why his comic partnership lasted so long. In 16 years of The Two Ronnies, Corbett could only remember one argument. Given that Ronnie Barker was a man of high standards and strong views that is an extraordinary achievement as the history of double acts is peppered with stories of partnerships that are less than friendly off-stage. It might have been different if Corbett had been fighting to get his material on the show, but they avoided that bear trap. Barker contributed his sketches under the pseudonym of Gerald Wiley to ensure it was used on merit - indeed Corbett once set about trying to find Wiley because he wanted to use one of his sketches in his stage show. Even the famous armchair monologues which just sound like Corbett's own stream of consciousness were written by Spike Mullins and One Foot in the Grave writer, David Renwick. What Ronnie Corbett brought was the skill of a great performer - utterly convincing, always funny and likeable.",It was one of the West End's great disasters. Lionel Bart's Robin Hood musical Twang closed after just 43 performances but it was a stroke of good luck for a young Ronnie Corbett.
"By Neil SmithBBC News entertainment reporter in Tallinn The 77-year-old did not attend the ceremony in Estonia, appearing instead via internet video software Skype. ""You have rewarded a truly European venture,"" he said from his Paris home. Scotland's Ewan McGregor was named best actor for his role in the film as a writer hired to ""ghost"" the memoirs of a former British prime minister. The Trainspotting star sent a pre-recorded message from the Thailand set of his latest project asking anyone who knew him at the event to contact him if he won. ""I'll be asleep when the award is presented and it'd be great to find out I've won when I wake up,"" the 39-year-old continued. As well as receiving the director prize, Polanski was also honoured for the screenplay he co-wrote with British novelist Robert Harris. Other prizes for The Ghost Writer - released as The Ghost in the UK - came for its music score and production design. Polanski was working on the film at the time of his arrest in Switzerland last year on a US arrest warrant relating to his 1977 conviction for unlawful sex with a 13-year-old girl. The Rosemary's Baby director spent nine months in jail and under house arrest before Swiss authorities decided, in July, not to extradite him to the US, where he remains a wanted man. Post-production trauma Polanski's awards were accepted at the ceremony in Tallinn by The Ghost Writer's British co-producer Timothy Burrill. ""Obviously I'm thrilled for Roman,"" he told the BBC News website after the event in Estonia's chilly capital city. ""He went through a period of trauma during post-production on the film, and the fact he was editing it from jail did not make it any easier."" However, Burrill played down the suggestion that The Ghost Writer's success represented a vote of solidarity for Polanski following his recent legal travails. ""I don't think people think like that,"" he said. ""I think people just like the film."" His sentiments were echoed by its German production designer Albrecht Konrad, who said Polanski's movie was ""a film first of all, a piece of craftsmanship"". ""I wouldn't say yes and I wouldn't say no,"" he said when asked whether off-screen events had swayed the voting. ""That's not for me to answer."" British nominations The Ghost Writer had been nominated for eight awards in all, more than any other title at this year's gala. The other main recipient was Israeli war film Lebanon, which was presented with a prize for its cinematography and a ""discovery"" award for its writer-director Samuel Moaz. Britain's Lesley Manville missed out on the best actress prize for her performance in Mike Leigh's Another Year, a gong won last year by her compatriot Kate Winslet for The Reader. That award went instead to French actress Sylvie Testud for Lourdes, in which she plays a wheelchair user visiting the titular Catholic shrine. Lifetime achievement honours went to Swiss actor Bruno Ganz and the Lebanese composer Gabriel Yared. The latter, best known for his collaborations with Anthony Minghella, received his prize from the late director's widow Carolyn Choa and French actress Juliette Binoche. The prize for European animated feature film went to The Illusionist, a UK-French co-production about a French conjuror on tour in Scotland. Presented annually by the European Film Academy, the awards are decided by its 2,300 members and were first staged in 1988. Next year's awards will be held in Berlin, with Valetta in Malta confirmed as the host city for the 2012 event. Polanski's use of Skype was welcomed by locals, the popular application having initially been developed by a trio of Estonian programmers. The ceremony was co-hosted by German comedienne Anke Engelke and Estonian actor Mart Avandi.","Roman Polanski's thriller The Ghost Writer was the toast of the European Film Awards, winning six prizes including best film and best director."

Channel 4 said it didn't think ""erasing our creative history is a quick fix for the issues affecting our society"". In the scene, which also features Jez's girlfriend Nancy (Rachel Blanchard), Jez says: ""It just feels almost wrong. Are you sure this isn't racist?"" Nancy replies: ""We're breaking a taboo, of course it feels wrong. We've got boundaries to smash, Jeremy."" The series originally ran from 2003 to 2015. A spokesperson for the channel said the programmes in its streaming archive span more than 30 years, and it is reviewing the way it handles old shows. 'A complex issue' They said: ""Many shows reflect the time they were made and some contain content which could now be regarded as inappropriate. ""It is a complex issue particularly when it relates to programmes that satirised, commented on or challenged a specific moment in our culture that is no longer relevant to audiences today. ""We understand the strong feelings provoked by some of this content but we do not believe that erasing our creative history is a quick fix for the issues affecting our society today. ""Channel 4 is committed to inclusion and diversity and opposes discrimination in any form and therefore, having reflected deeply on this subject, we are undertaking a review of the principles governing how we handle historic programmes across our platforms."" Netflix declined to comment. Many platforms are re-evaluating their offerings following mass protests against racism after the death of George Floyd in police custody. Gone With The Wind was temporarily removed from HBO Max, but has now been reinstated alongside a disclaimer saying the Oscar-winning 1939 film ""denies the horrors of slavery"".

"By Steven McIntoshEntertainment reporter That's the challenge British-born Paul Surridge faced last year when he took over as creative director of Italian clothing brand Roberto Cavalli, with less than two months to go until Milan Fashion Week. But, he tells BBC News, the tight turnaround was arguably a blessing in disguise - as it didn't give him time to stop and think about the huge job he'd just inherited. ""When you think about whose shoes you're filling, there's obviously a lot of pressure. But at that time it was sleeves up, heads down, get on with the job,"" he says. ""A good leader is someone who gives good instructions and knows what they want. My job was to communicate and get answers quicker. A new team, a new feeling, a new aspiration. Being in the office 24/7 until the show was done. It was a huge challenge."" Cavalli is known for the colourful and glamorous red carpet dresses generally seen on film stars, but Surridge says he was keen to expand. ""When I joined the company last year, I made a quick visit to the stores,"" he says. ""Cavalli is an aspirational brand that's synonymous with lifestyle, luxury, glamour. But today, a brand has to grow, be relevant and accessible to some extent, and I just felt that there was a lack of daywear at Cavalli. ""Everyone knows [the company] for the red carpet dress, but that's one person on a carpet for one moment in a lifetime. How do we capture the new millennial mindset? So I kind of set out focusing on daywear."" What do the critics say? Surridge's appointment came after a turbulent time for Cavalli. It had streamlined its various brands and seen the arrival (and departure) of designer Peter Dundas, who lasted only 19 months as creative director - a relatively short spell. His debut collection in 2015 received mixed reviews, and shortly after he joined an Italian private equity fund bought a 90% stake in the brand and outlined plans for a creative and commercial overhaul. Surridge took over last summer despite being a relatively lesser-known figure, but steadied the ship and made a success of his first fashion week show, despite the limited timeframe. So what does his day-to-day job actually involve? ""A creative director today is a curator,"" he explains. ""In fashion particularly, it sets the mood, the colour card, the pattern direction, the textures. Is a collection athletic? Sensual? Sexy? Transparent? Stretch? All the adjectives that circulate a collection."" Surridge has previously worked in menswear positions for Burberry, Prada and Calvin Klein. But at Cavalli, he is overseeing womenswear too. ""With a women's collection, there are infinite possibilities,"" he explains. ""It's more about the emotion, collaging together different references. An evening dress with a flat shoe or an evening dress with a high-heeled shoe changes completely the impact of the attitude of the woman, how she walks, projects herself. ""Menswear is more about function and practicality. It's more structured, how you develop a men's collection."" He stays in touch with Roberto Cavalli himself, who is now aged 77, but it doesn't sound like the company's founder interferes too much. ""We've stayed in contact,"" he says. ""Sometimes he'll send me a text, and I'll respond, obviously... He's an ambassador for the brand, the lifestyle. It's important he feels he can still see the celebration of his name through the work that he's doing."" Surridge was born in Hertfordshire, and trained at Central Saint Martins, but has lived in Milan now for more than a decade. ""I feel British, my culture's British. But when I go home they say I have an Italian accent, and I'm like 'what?!'"" he laughs. ""I don't miss it, but when I go home I realise that I have missed it,"" he says of the UK. ""I watch The Crown on Netflix and I get all nostalgic and romantic and think, 'God I'd love to have tea with Elizabeth.' And you think wow, the UK is incredible. ""[London] is an international city. I call it the New York of Europe. Milan is home, it's where I belong now, but then I go home and see everything in London - Sadler's Wells, the arts scene, and then I think I need to come back more often."" He says he currently gets back to the UK once every three months or so. ""I think as I'm getting older, my parents are getting older, my nieces are growing up, I don't want to become one of those designers who just buries themselves in their work, a great creative designer is someone who lives."" Roberto Cavalli's autumn/winter 2018 collection will debut on Friday at 15:00 CET (14:00 GMT) as part of Milan Fashion Week.",Putting together a fashion show is a lot of pressure. But imagine doing it with eight weeks' notice.
"By Mark SavageBBC Music reporter Judge Michael W Fitzgerald made the comments while dismissing a copyright case against Taylor Swift. Songwriters Sean Hall and Nathan Butler sued the star last year, arguing her single Shake It Off stole from their composition, Playas Gon' Play. They said the chorus of her song relied on their lyric, ""playas, they gonna play, and haters, they gonna hate"". Although short phrases are generally immune from copyright claims, the writers argued that combining the two thoughts was original enough to warrant protection. Fitzgerald disagreed - in quite some style. 'Lacks the modicum of originality and creativity ' ""The lynchpin of this entire case is thus whether or not the lyrics 'Playas, they gonna play, and haters, they gonna hate' are eligible for protection,"" he wrote. ""In the early 2000s, popular culture was adequately suffused with the concepts of players and haters to render the phrases 'playas… gonna play' or 'haters… gonna hate', standing on their own, no more creative than 'runners gonna run'; 'drummers gonna drum'; or 'swimmers gonna swim.' ""The concept of actors acting in accordance with their essential nature is not at all creative; it is banal. ""The allegedly infringed lyrics are short phrases that lack the modicum of originality and creativity required for copyright protection,"" Fitzgerald added. The judge also criticised the plaintiffs ""clunky"" legal arguments, before approving Swift's motion to dismiss the case. ""In sum, the lyrics at issue... are too brief, unoriginal, and uncreative to warrant protection under the Copyright Act,"" he wrote. However, he offered Hall and Butler one last chance to amend their argument before the case is settled on 26 February, ""just in case there are more similarities between Playas Gon' Play and Shake it Off than Plaintiffs have alleged thus far"". Playas Gon' Play was a minor hit for US girl band 3LW in 2001. Hall has subsequently written and produced for artists such as Justin Bieber and Maroon 5, while Butler has worked with artists including Backstreet Boys and Luther Vandross. Their lawyer, Gerard Fox, said he would not file an amendment to the original complaint, but planned to appeal Judge Fitzgerald's ruling. Fox said the judge should have found an expert to rule on the originality of the lyrics, rather than interpreting them himself. ""He cannot make himself an expert in the music industry,"" he said.

"Christopher Nolan's sci-fi spy thriller is the first major studio release since cinemas began reopening in July. Tenet opened in more than 600 UK and Irish cinemas last week having had its launch delayed several times. The Showcase cinema chain said its ticket sales increased by 75% ahead of the film's eagerly anticipated release. Tenet also performed well internationally, taking $53.6m (£40m) from sites in the Middle East, Europe and South Korea. The film, a time-bending action drama set in numerous countries, will open in the US, Russia and China later this week.

He said British film-maker Nolan had ""once again delivered an event-worthy motion picture that demands to be seen on the big screen"". Face masks are currently mandatory in UK and Irish cinemas, which are operating at a reduced capacity due to social distancing guidelines. Takings have been modest since they began reopening in July, with only one other title making more than £1m over that period. That film was the Russell Crowe road rage thriller Unhinged, whose takings now stand at £1.2m after five weeks on release. Tenet's closest official competitor over the weekend was Onward, which opened in cinemas before the coronavirus lockdown in March. The fantastical Pixar animation made £185,028 last weekend, bringing its overall takings since release to £6.65m. Technically, though, it was outperformed by The New Mutants, which had a weekend of previews ahead of its release on Friday.

"The critically-acclaimed comedy, which debuted in 2006, won a string of Emmys but has been overshadowed by the success of Modern Family and Glee. Created by comedian Tina Fey, the show revolves around the production of a late night sketch show, and stars Fey alongside Alec Baldwin. However, audiences have dwindled to an average 3.5 million viewers in the US. Fey plays Liz Lemon, the head writer of fictional series TGS, who has to deal with dysfunctional stars and a disastrous love life. Baldwin is Jack Donaghy, the gravel-voiced neo-con boss of TV network NBC, who becomes Lemon's unofficial mentor. The show is partly based on Fey's experiences of working on long-running US sketch show Saturday Night Live. 'On the horizon' Last month, Baldwin appeared to suggest on Twitter that he was leaving the show, but Fey rebuffed the rumours on US talk show The View. ""As far as I know, he's not leaving the show. We're all in this together 'til the end,"" said Fey, in April. ""I think that he just maybe means that the end of the show - we're in six years - that the end of the show is visible on the horizon."" The final season will run for just 13 episodes, and will be announced as part of NBC's forthcoming primetime schedule next week. The comedy was dropped from British terrestrial TV following its second series in 2009, after a run of poor viewing figures on Channel Five. It has since been shown in the UK on Comedy Central.","Hit US sitcom 30 Rock is to come to an end, following an abbreviated seventh series, amid falling ratings."
"By Ian YoungsArts reporter, BBC News Thirteen-year-old Nicky dreams of having the perfect family. In an attempt to win an idyllic holiday, she writes a competition entry about her happy and harmonious household. Except in reality it is not very happy and harmonious at all. ""They're not dysfunctional, but they're a normal family that's fallen into tramlines, emotionally and spiritually, and have their own problems,"" Firth says. ""Nothing I hope any family in the country wouldn't recognise to some degree."" Nicky's family fortunes unfold in Firth's new musical This Is My Family, which opens at the Sheffield Crucible on Wednesday. Firth, known for writing the screen and stage versions of Calendar Girls, the Madness musical Our House and the film Kinky Boots, says he thought it would be funny to base a comedy on ""disastrous holidays that I can remember from my childhood"". ""That's where I started off,"" he says. ""But what it's evolved into, I think, is something about family and about what family means. What the value of it is, what the point of it is in an age when 50% of the family in any kid's class will be of a different structure - there will be parents who have gone apart and remarried. ""None of that I particularly intended."" Nicky - who is actually played by 25-year old Evelyn Hoskins - comes to realise that her clan, which includes her mum, dad, brother, aunt and grandmother, is in real danger of breaking up. So she tries to bring them back together. Firth describes the story as ""optimistic"". As befits a feelgood comedy, it could come across as rose-tinted and idealistic. The writer says: ""There is this sense [in society] of, what is the point of families keeping together in a world which is increasingly telling you that, if you're not happy, you erase and start again? Get out, don't put up with second best. ""There is a danger of couples forgetting what brought them together in the first place and jumping ship more quickly than they possibly need to. ""It's not for a moment suggesting that all families stay together - that would be unfair and unhelpful. ""But there is a sense within the story that this is a family that could have done that [broken up], but actually what they needed to do was to look inside for what was wrong."" The audience sees the family through Nicky's eyes. From the moment Firth wrote her first line - ""OK, so this is my family"" - he decided it would sound better if it was sung, and so the show became a musical. Clare Burt plays mum Yvonne, Bill Champion is dad Steve and grandmother May is played by West End veteran Sian Phillips. It is a member of the lesser-spotted breed of new British musicals that are not based on existing films, books or band back catalogues. As such, it is a tough sell and is starting out in the Crucible's cosy 400-capacity studio. ""Getting people to take a risk on coming to see a musical now is almost unheard of,"" Firth says. ""We don't have that culture in this country. ""Normally they've been based on something people know. It's a movie or a back catalogue. There's something that removes the risk, and with this there isn't anything that removes the risk. ""This is a new story they've never heard of from a writer who's never really written a musical before in a studio space, so it's triple scary. ""The problem is that a lot of the time, a new musical, and especially one in a studio, people may feel that it's an experimental, discordant, scary new music thing. Which of course this show isn't. ""This show is very, very simple and I hope as accessible as a straightforward comedy. It just happens to take flight with music."" If This Is My Family does well in the studio, it may graduate to larger theatres. If it does not, it will not. To illustrate the chasm between brand new musicals and adaptations, a stage version of Kinky Boots is currently sweeping all before it on Broadway, recently winning six Tony Awards. (Although it is questionable how many American punters have seen the original 2005 British film, for which Firth co-wrote the script.) Firth has not yet seen that musical. ""It's very strange,"" he says. ""It's rather like having an adopted child growing up in another country. I'm not quite sure how much of him or her I will recognise when it returns. ""I went online and saw one of the song titles and thought, I'm sure I wrote that line. But I'm very proud that it's had this other life and it's great that they've made it a success because there are a lot of films out there and it's lovely for them to have seen it. ""And actually, more people know about the movie now than six months ago."" This Is My Family has a long way to go. The writer admits that there are ""huge elements"" of his own family in its characters. So will the Firths be going on a family outing to the show's opening night? ""Do you know what, we were going to be,"" he replies. ""But one of the kids said, 'Actually, can I go to Milly's party?' So she will come on another night. That's what families are like.""","Sulky teenagers, stressed parents, overbearing in-laws - writer Tim Firth, who penned Calendar Girls, is singing the praises of the modern British family in a new musical comedy."

There has been much focus on Martin Luther King biopic Selma, with director Ava DuVernay and star David Oyelowo both missing out. At the Critics' Choice award, another Selma actor, Wendell Pierce, said there would be ""amazement"" Oyelowo was not nominated once people saw the film. But Ms Boone Isaacs said acclaim for Selma was reflected in its Best Picture nomination, which is chosen by all the academy members. She said that while the Academy continued to make efforts to become more diverse, the wider industry needed to do the same.

"By Mark SavageBBC News entertainment reporter The musician was presented with the prize by his friend, singer Rod Stewart, who described him as ""the second-best rock singer ever"". Sir Elton said he was ""flattered"" by the award, given to artists who have had a ""lasting impact"" on UK culture. He also played several of his hits, including Your Song and Tiny Dancer. Students from the Royal Academy of Music, where Sir Elton trained, joined him on stage to play Home Again, from his new album Diving Board, while Stewart duetted with his ""dear mate"" on the closing song, Sad Songs (Say So Much). The concert was attended by the likes of Liz Hurley and Gary Barlow, while video messages were played from President Clinton, Ringo Starr and tennis legend Billie Jean King, for whom Sir Elton wrote Philadelphia Freedom. The star, wearing red sequinned shoes, received a standing ovation as he accepted the gold Brits trophy. Holding it aloft, he remarked: ""They've even made it sparkly on the bottom, which you know I love"". He dedicated the award to writing partner Bernie Taupin, ""who I wouldn't be here without"", as well as the ""Women's Institute and you, the fans"". The 66-year-old added: ""I can think of a couple of people who might have deserved it more than me."" Pop star Lulu, who was a special guest at the show, told the BBC ""he is a one-off, he is totally unique. ""Only the Rolling Stones, the Beatles and Elvis are at the top [with him]. So it's perfectly fitting he should get the first Icon award."" James Blunt, who is signed to the star's management company, described him as ""the kindest man I've ever met"". ""On a music level, on a friendship level, on a humanitarian level this is an incredibly special person - and that's not including his other great talent, which is he is an incredible songwriter and a formidable performer."" 'Hell of a summer' Sir Elton, who plays more than 100 gigs every year, had to cancel several concerts over the summer after having surgery for appendicitis. He told The Sun he had performed 10 shows ""in agony"" before he called doctors. ""I was a ticking time bomb. I guess I could have died at any time. I feel so lucky and grateful to be alive,"" he said. Speaking to Dermot O'Leary on stage during Monday's show at the Palladium, he added: ""It's been a hell of a summer. I'm glad to be rid of the appendix - it was a pesky little bugger."" He said he would not curtail his touring schedule as he was ""addicted to playing live"". ""I've played 92 countries, and I want to play 100,"" he continued. ""That's just the way I'm programmed"". The two-and-a-half-hour concert took the form of a career retrospective, with O'Leary interviewing Sir Elton about his career in between songs. He discussed growing up in the ""secretive"" 1950s and how he had been forced to abandon any hope of becoming a classical pianist because his ""hands are too small"". The star cringed as footage from his infamously bad-tempered fly on the wall documentary Tantrums and Tiaras was played into the theatre, but he was keen to stress he had put his ""little demons"" to rest. ""I'm not a diva any more,"" he said. ""I like things a certain way but it's called professionalism, I think."" He proved his point later by making his band re-start the song Mexican Vacation four times. ""It's a new song,"" he explained, ""we're getting excited."" Outstanding contribution Sir Elton has sold more than 250 million records globally, and next month's Diving Board will be his 30th studio album. His track Candle in the Wind '97, which was released in the wake of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales and which he performed at her funeral, is the biggest-selling single of all time, shifting 33 million copies, 4.9 million of which were bought in the UK. The Icon prize has been created by the BPI, the music industry's trade body, which also runs the Brit Awards. Prior to Monday's show, Sir Elton had already won two Brits for outstanding contribution to the music industry, as well as the Freddie Mercury memorial award for his charity work. He was presented with the latter prize at the White House in 2008, by then-Prime Minister Tony Blair. Proceeds from the Icon award show will go to the Brit Trust, Text Santa and the Royal Academy of Music. The highlights will be shown on ITV on 13 September.","Sir Elton John has won the first ever Brits Icon award, in a gala concert which marked his stage return after surgery for appendicitis."

"Speaking at a Radio Academy event in London, George Ergatoudis said play counts from services like Spotify and YouTube could be included as soon as this summer. While countries such as the US and Germany already count music streams, the UK chart is based on sales alone. The Official Charts Company says there is no firm date set for the change. Chief executive Martin Talbot told the BBC the company was still working out the ""how"" and ""when"" behind the plans. In the UK, music streaming increased by 33.7% in 2013 and now accounts for nearly 10% of revenues from recorded music. In the last year 7.4 billion songs were streamed via premium or ad-funded music services. Daft Punk's Get Lucky was the most streamed track of 2013 in the UK, ahead of Bastille's Pompeii and Robin Thicke's Blurred Lines. Last year was also a fifth successive record year for British singles sales, up 6% to 188.6m with the vast majority - 99.6% - accounted for by digital downloads. Speaking in Music Week last week, Mr Talbot said: ""We are beginning to look at this, as every market is - but we have a lot of due diligence to do before making what would be a significant jump in the UK."" He cited issues including what kind of streams should be counted and the possible impact on new and independent artists. The company will also have to decide how many ""plays"" of a YouTube video or Spotify track would count as the equivalent of one sale. There will also be questions about how long a user has to listen to a track before it is counted - some statisticians equate a 30-second stream to one play, others prefer only to count users who stream an entire song. Mr Talbot's statement to Music Week was in response Universal Music UK boss, David Joseph, who told the magazine that the UK charts risk becoming irrelevant if they don't begin including streaming soon. The Official Charts Company has previously explained that the UK chart methodology and market are both very different to America, where the Hot 100 takes into account radio airplay. The company launched a separate Official Streaming Chart in 2012. Mr Ergatoudis said merging that data into the Top 40 would be one of the biggest transitional changes in the Official Chart's history.",The head of music at Radio 1 and Radio 1Xtra has said streaming will soon be included in the top 40 singles chart.
"By Mark SavageBBC music reporter The Welsh guitarist was the driving force behind The Spencer Davis Group, who scored transatlantic hits with Keep On Running and Somebody Help Me. The band, which also featured a teenage Stevie Winwood, toured with The Who and The Rolling Stones in the 60s. Davis died in hospital on Monday, while being treated for pneumonia, his agent told the BBC. ""He was a very good friend,"" said Bob Birk, who had worked with the musician for more than 30 years. ""He was a highly ethical, very talented, good-hearted, extremely intelligent, generous man. He will be missed."" Telegram from the Beatles The son of a paratrooper, Davis was born in Swansea in 1939 and first started learning harmonica and the accordion at the age of six. He moved to London to work for the civil service at the age of 16, but later relocated to Birmingham, where he taught German by day, and played in local clubs at night. Inspired by blues and skiffle, he formed a band called The Saints with Bill Wyman, later a member of the Rolling Stones; and performed folk music with Christine Perfect - who, as Christine McVie, became a core member of Fleetwood Mac's classic line-up. But it was with his eponymous rock group that he struck gold. Formed in 1963, The Spencer Davis Group featured Davis on guitar, a teenage Stevie Winwood on organ and vocals, his brother Muff on bass and Peter York on drums. Originally called The Rhythm & Blues Quartette, they changed their name in 1964 when Muff pointed out that Davis was the only one who enjoyed doing interviews - the logic being that the rest of the band could slope off to the pub while he handled the press. Their breakout hit, Keep On Running, was a cover of a song by West Indian performer Jackie Edwards. When it topped the UK charts in 1966, it knocked the double A-sided Beatles single We Can Work It Out/Day Tripper from the top slot - and Davis received a telegram from the band congratulating him on the achievement. ""It's in a pile of papers somewhere,"" he told the BBC in 2009. ""It said, 'Congratulations on reaching number one - The Beatles.'"" The follow-up was delayed when Davis bashed his head on a car windscreen after braking to avoid a dog - but Somebody Help Me, another Jackie Edwards cover, gave the quartet a second number one in March 1966. The band went on to prove they had songwriting chops of their own, with hit singles like I'm A Man and Gimme Some Lovin', which was later covered by The Blues Brothers. The Spencer Davis Group also recorded the theme song for the long-running children's TV show Magpie, under the pseudonym The Murgatroyd Band - a reference to the show's mascot, a fat magpie named Murgatroyd. 'The Professor' By 1966, the band had starred in their own film, a musical comedy called The Ghost Goes Gear, which found the band stranded in a haunted manor. Davis also made a cameo in The Beatles' Magical Mystery Tour, as a bus passenger. Hits followed in the US, although the band never toured there; while Davis's ability with languages (he was fluent in German, French and Spanish) helped the band further their career in Europe. Those linguistic capabilities even led to Davis recording a German version of The Age Of Aquarius (Aquarius Der Wassermann) in 1968, and earned him a lasting nickname: ""The Professor"". However, the Spencer Davis Group came to an untimely end in 1967 when, at the height of their fame, Winwood quit to form Traffic, leaving Davis without his dynamic frontman. The band recorded a few more minor hits, but broke up soon after, with Davis moving to California, where he embarked on a short-lived solo career. At the time, he later claimed, he was near to bankruptcy, thanks to a punitive contract with Island Records. ""I didn't realise what had been going on. I'd sold millions of records and hadn't seen a penny from them,"" he told Music Mart magazine in 2005. ""In 1970, I was considering declaring bankruptcy, but I'd written a track with Eddie Hardin, called Don't Want You No More, which the Allman Brothers put on their Beginnings album. The damned thing sold six million copies. Suddenly a cheque for £5,000 arrived through the door and I'd never seen so much money in all my life. ""I saw more money from that one song than I saw from all the stuff that had been an Island production."" After confronting Island Records' owner Chris Blackwell over the issue, he was given a job in artist development at the label in the mid-70s. There, he helped to promote newcomers like Bob Marley, Robert Palmer and Eddie And The Hot Rods, as well as working alongside Winwood, who was now establishing himself as a solo artist. Davis returned to songwriting with 1984's Crossfire, which featured contributions from Dusty Springfield and Booker T. He subsequently reformed the Spencer Davis Group - minus the Winwood brothers - with whom he toured the world for the rest of his career, often playing more than 200 shows a year. Birmingham International Jazz Festival founder Jim Simpson, who was told about Davis' passing by drummer Pete York, said: ""Spencer was a lovely man - always very courteous and a purist about music. ""The Spencer Davis Group stuck more to the blues and never became a fully-fledged rock band. Spencer was scholarly and well educated, very gentle and kind and his tastes in music were spot on.""

The star exhibit will be the restored outer panels of The Adoration of the Mystic Lamb, otherwise known as the Ghent Altarpiece. If you like art, you'll love this show. Rembrandt had his big anniversary last year, marked by a sensational show at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, which celebrated the work of the Golden Age painter. If you didn't get there then all is not lost, your FOMO can be tempered by a visit to the Ashmolean museum in Oxford this spring for its Young Rembrandt show, imported from the Dutch master's home town of Leiden. If your taste leans towards the ultra-modern, then maybe plan an autumn visit to Cardiff and the National Museum Wales for the bi-annual Artes Mundi. It is rapidly overtaking the Turner Prize as the most vital award for the art of our time, and this year has a shortlist of six exceptional international artists selected from more than 500 nominations that covered 60 countries. Another group show well worth noting is We Will Walk at the Turner Contemporary Gallery in Margate. It opens in February, and will feature pieces by 20 African American artists who were working in the 1950s and 60s in or around Alabama where they were shaping and responding to the Civil Rights movement. If you're after something completely different but utterly wonderful, the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art has the exhibition for you in May. Ray Harryhausen was a pioneering, brilliant special effects film-maker whose credits include movie masterpieces such as Jason and the Argonauts and One Million Years BC. His work inspired Peter Jackson, Steven Spielberg and many other leading directors - it will inspire you too, when you see his designs and creations laid out before you in glass cases and picture frames. If magical worlds of make-believe are your bag, then you're in for a treat down at the V&A museum in London, which has a summer exhibition dedicated to the art and artefacts connected to Lewis Carroll's classic fantasy novel Alice in Wonderland. That's not the only blockbuster in the capital in 2020. Big hitters Titian (National Gallery) and Andy Warhol (Tate Modern) will be slugging it out for your attention in March. I'd go to both. In fact, why not take the day off and pop over to Tate Britain to see an early career exhibition of one of the best painters working today, Lynette Yiadom-Boakye. Other delights coming to London in 2020 include a show in April dedicated to the magnificent baroque painter Artemisia Gentileschi (National Gallery) at the same time as the British Museum is exploring Tantras, sacred Indian texts from the 6th Century. And, in June, the one-and-only Marina Abramovic (Royal Academy) will be in-da-house staging a full retrospective of her performance art masterpieces. And finally, why not finish the year in style, with a visit to the Design Museum in Kensington, which will be hosting an exhibition dedicated to the life and work of the fashion superstar Miuccia Prada. Happy new year.","Let's start in Bath at the Holburne museum, for an exhibition of Grayson Perry's early work in a show with the Adrian Mole-ish subtitle, The Pre-Therapy Years. Should be good. Planning for it started with a public appeal in 2018 to source the Turner Prize-winning potter's early ceramic works made between 1982 and the mid-1990s."
"Will GompertzArts editor@WillGompertzBBCon Twitter In fact, every day for the past 13 years Mike has uploaded a new image. You can see them on his Instagram feed 'beeple_crap': Beeple being his nom de plume when in graphic artist mode. Initially, it was a good way for him to market his skills to internet savvy clients, including Apple, Nike, Coca-Cola, Louis Vuitton, and a host of pop stars from Justin Bieber to Katy Perry. It turned out people liked Beeple. His Instagram following grew and grew like Jack's beanstalk, reaching the heady heights of 1.9 million today. His images became ""weirder"" and ""grosser"" (his words) as time went on, and he learnt to use 3D technology. Nowadays his ""everydays"" have a sci-fi comic book look. They are often responding to the news agenda or riffing on pop culture, and are typically set in post-apocalyptic futuristic landscapes. Some take him minutes to make, other a few hours. His rule is one a day. I tell you this because Mike has had a big week. When Covid struck and his design business work slowed down, he started to explore the mind-boggling world of cryptocurrencies, blockchains and Non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which are basically digital certificates of ownership. He discovered that there were some serious players in the virtual game, serious players who would pay serious money for a piece of digital art that came with an NFT that authenticated it as unique. Mike changed his focus from Winkelmann the designer to Beeple the artist. And then he had an idea… He created a collage of all the ""everyday""' images he had produced over the years and called it: Everydays: The First 5000 Days. He partnered with the auction house Christie's, which had never sold a purely digital work before, an artwork that didn't exist in the real life but belonged in a virtual world. They created an online auction for the work that lasted for two weeks and started the bidding at $100. The price slowly started to creep up, then it began to accelerate, before going stratospheric in the final minutes, where it was increasing in increments of well over $1 million. The winning bid was $60 million, which, when all the extra charges were added, left the purchaser with a bill of $69 million. That is a lot of money for an encrypted Jpeg. Nobody could believe the sum paid. Not Christies, not art market specialists, and not Beeple (there's a nice video on the Christie's website that shows him watching the final minutes of the auction). Frankly, I don't get it either. It doesn't make any sense to me. But then nor did someone paying $450 million to buy Salvator Mundi in 2017, an over-restored wreck of a painting that some - but not all - experts attribute to Leonardo da Vinci, or da Vinci and his studio. So, best to put money aside and consider Everydays: The First 5000 Days as a work of visual art and not as a tradeable commodity/financial investment. Is it any good? Yes, is the short answer. If you're into the comic book aesthetic, which can be traced back decades, then Beeple is a talented exponent of the genre. It's not too much of a stretch to make a reference to Hieronymus Bosch's 15th Century densely weird masterpieces, or Andy Warhol's Pop Art, or the macabre nature of Philip Guston's surreal, cartoonish paintings of the late 1960s and 70s. The main difference being Beeple is making his images using a different technique, a different medium, and different materials: he is a 21st Century artist whose time has come in part because of the digital lives we are living because of the pandemic. The speed at which he works is not uncommon in the history of art, nor are the subjects he addresses. It is reasonable to compare him to other artists. Although, in the context of fine art rather than graphic design, his images lack the psychological intensity you find in the paintings of, say, Jennifer Packer - whose exhibition at the Serpentine Gallery in London I reviewed recently. Beeple's artworks read to me more like a comedian's one-liner than a novel captured in a picture, which is what the greatest artists are able to achieve. There is also an issue about the work and the blockchain technology being used to give it value, which should not be overlooked. Digital art might not exist in the real world, but it sure does it some real environmental harm. The energy intensive tech used to create and store cryptoart (a line of code - metadata - that traces back to an image) is exactly what the world doesn't need right now: computers whirring away day and night to generate NFTs consume huge amounts of energy. Should that be a consideration when viewing the work? I think so - it is part of the work insomuch as it is the reason for the astronomical price that was paid to own its NFT. Everydays: The First 5000 Days will go down in history either as the moment before the short-lived cryptoart bubble burst, or as the first chapter in a new story of art. I won't pretend to have viewed each and every image, but I have seen enough to know it is of artistic and documentary merit.

"By Mark SavageBBC Music reporter The Swedish quartet said the new material was an ""unexpected consequence"" of their recent decision to put together a ""virtual reality"" tour. ""We all four felt that, after some 35 years, it could be fun to join forces again and go into the studio,"" the band said on Instagram. ""And it was like time stood still."" No release date has been set for the new songs - but one of them, titled I Still Have Faith In You, will be performed in December on a TV special broadcast by the BBC and NBC. Abba's spokesperson Gorel Hanser told the BBC the atmosphere in the studio was ""magic"". ""It was like no time had passed at all,"" she said. ""It was like the olden days. They were happy, it was easy and warm-hearted, and it was actually quite moving. I wasn't the only one with tears in my eyes."" But she said said the group would not perform live, other than as holograms in the forthcoming Abba Avatar tour. ""It's a studio moment, I can promise you,"" she said. ""Don't expect too much."" The band have resisted pressure to reform since they stopped recording together in 1982, despite a reported $1bn (£689m) offer to tour in 2000. In an interview with the BBC in 2013, Agnetha Faltskog said she preferred to leave the band in the past. ""It was such a long time ago, and we are getting older, and we have our different lives,"" she explained. News of the new material comes in a bumper year for Abba fans. An immersive exhibition based on the band's career is running on London's South Bank, while Chess, the musical Bjorn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson wrote with Sir Tim Rice, is being revived in the West End. A sequel to the film version of Mamma Mia!, starring Amanda Seyfried, Lily James and Cher, will be released on 20 July. Speaking to BBC News, Rod Stephen, founder of Abba tribute act Bjorn Again, described the new material as ""a whole new beginning"". ""I heard about Abba releasing new songs and I was instantly, like everyone else in the Abba community, really excited to know what the songs were and how they're going to sound. Will it have that 1970s sound or will it be up to date? ""It's brilliant really, because we love Abba's music to death. I just hope they're great songs, I hope they're equivalent to Dancing Queen or Mamma Mia."" He added: ""I know Benny and Bjorn wouldn't release something in this way unless they were good songs."" Speaking to the BBC's Adam Fleming last week, Ulvaeus had hinted that there could be new material. Here's what he said: How did the Abba avatar idea come about? We were introduced to an idea by Simon Fuller who is, as you know, an entertainment entrepreneur - [creator of] the format of American Idol and manager of the Spice Girls and so forth. He came to Stockholm and he presented this idea to us that we could make identical digital copies of ourselves of a certain age and that those copies could then go on tour and they could sing our songs, you know, and lip sync. I've seen this project halfway through and it's already mind-boggling. What does it actually look like? Does it look like a younger you? Yes. Real. And they say once it's finished you'll never see that it's not a human being. And what attracted me personally to this is of course I'm always curious, scientifically-curious and this is new technology and we are pioneers. So I thought, 'Yeah let's go for it,' and you know the other three went for it as well. What is the actual format of the tribute show going to be? Is it going to be these Abba-tars all the way though? No, other people as well. And as for the format I'm not entirely sure what it's going to look like but some sort of tribute show with these Abba-tars for want of a better word as the kind of centrepiece. Will you write new material for it? We don't know what the Abba-tars will sing yet but there's lots to choose from of the old stuff and yeah, I'm not ready to say that yet. So there could be new songs… I'm… it's up in the air. Stay tuned… Yeah. Why not reform and have a reunion? The real you, rather than the virtual ones. Yeah, why not? Well… it never seemed like a good idea. It's not that we haven't had offers over the years. But somehow we always thought that the Abba that people have in their minds are the once-young and energetic group from the '70s. And we just never felt the urge to go on tour, I guess. On the whole we toured very little. We had like 10 years together and of those 10 years maybe we toured, like, seven months. Not more than that. So to go on tour as a geriatric, I don't know! Formed in 1972, Abba were essentially a Swedish supergroup, consisting of songwriters Ulvaeus and Andersson from The Hep Stars and singers Faltskog and Anni-Frid Lyngstad, who had scored success as solo artists. But their joint project completely eclipsed their previous successes. After winning the Eurovision Song Contest with Waterloo in 1974, the band sold almost 400 million singles and albums around the world. Mamma Mia!, the musical based on their hits and produced by Ulvaeus and Andersson, has been seen by more than 50 million people. During their most successful period, the band survived marriage break-ups between Ulvaeus and Faltskog, and Lyngstad and Andersson, but they finally called it a day in 1983. Their final recording sessions, in 1982, produced the hits Under Attack and The Day Before You Came, which featured on the compilation album The Singles. Their last public performance came three years later, on the Swedish version of TV show This Is Your Life, which honoured their manager Stig Anderson.

"By Mark SavageBBC music reporter The Oscar winner is just one of several stars who has lent their voice to a covers album, recorded at Abbey Road, in aid of the charity. It also features two Doctor Whos: David Tennant, singing The Proclaimers' Sunshine on Leith; and Jodie Whittaker, who covered Coldplay's Yellow. Whittaker's track is out now, with the full album due next month. Colman's appreciation of mid-90s trip-hop was hitherto unknown, but Portishead's debut album Dummy would have been a fixture in student digs while she studied at Cambridge University and the Bristol Old Vic theatre school. While she isn't known for singing roles, she did sing Something's Gotten Hold of my Heart in Yorgos Lanthimos' 2015 film The Lobster. Colman was also part of her school choir and played Sarah Brown in a production of Guys And Dolls at her sixth form college in Norfolk. ""She has a beautiful singing voice,"" her drama tutor Paul Hands told The Times [subscription] earlier this year. ""We haven't really seen that voice in public yet."" The actress also delivered a half-sung, half-spoken performance in London Road, the 2015 film version of a musical about the serial killer Steve Wright. 'I can hold a tune' The unusual score required Colman and her co-star Tom Hardy to perform songs using the rhythms and pitch of speech, rather than using a top-line melody. ""It was really scary,"" she told the Evening Standard. ""I can hold a tune, but I'm not under any impression I'm a proper singer."" The 45-year-old, who made her name with comedic roles in Peep Show, Rev and Twenty Twelve, won an Oscar earlier this year for playing Queen Anne in The Favourite.

"By Ian YoungsArts reporter, BBC News Ten years ago on Friday, an old flour mill on the banks of the River Tyne was reborn as a temple to modern art when Gateshead's Baltic gallery opened its doors. The £46m Baltic and its neighbour the Sage, a futuristic Norman Foster-designed concert hall, have become city landmarks. But as well as cultural venues, they are monuments to the metamorphoses cities like Newcastle and Gateshead have gone through since the steam and soot of heavy industry subsided. The Baltic and Sage demonstrate how ""cultural investment"" can regenerate an area, according to Baltic director Godfrey Worsdale, who points to new hotels, a design centre and college that have sprung up in their shadows. ""Whilst the major cultural venues in Newcastle and Gateshead do demand almost £20m a year from the public purse to operate,"" he says, ""we know that the return into the regional economy is something like £80m. ""So it's a massive injection of resource into the regional economy and that has obviously created very significant numbers of opportunities for the local population."" The Baltic and Sage do not just represent bricks-and-mortar renovation, but have also changed the atmosphere and the way people feel about the city, he believes. The Baltic attracts about 400,000 visits per year, including a dedicated audience of 80,000 who now come to every exhibition. It was among the new British galleries that followed in the wake of the Guggenheim in Bilbao, Spain, which reinvented the former port city when it opened in 1997. The ""Bilbao effect"" was then chased by the Nottingham Contemporary, the Middlesbrough Institute of Modern Art (Mima), the Towner in Eastbourne, the Public in West Bromwich, the Turner Contemporary in Margate, the Hepworth Wakefield and Firstsite in Colchester. Between them, they cost £195m to build. In Middlesbrough, Mima celebrated its fifth birthday in January and the striking building was intended to provide a focal point for the central square. But, surrounded by uniformly ugly office blocks, a row of empty shop units and a couple of Georgian council buildings, the glass-fronted gallery could have been beamed in from another planet. Mima has earned a good reputation in the art world but costs £1m a year to the council, which is having its budget cut by £50m over the next four years. In 2010, the town was ranked as the least able place in the country to cope with economic shocks like public sector cuts. The local jury seems to still be considering its verdict on whether the gallery has been a good thing. When asked whether it has made Middlesbrough a more desirable place to live, a lady in a local estate agent answers: ""It's neither here nor there. ""I suppose it's something nice to look at in the middle of this mess."" She declined to be identified. Lots of people in the town centre look blankly when asked what impact Mima has made and say modern art is not their cup of tea. A newspaper seller called Alan declares it ""a waste of money"", adding: ""They could spend however much millions of pounds on maybe getting something for the kids. Like the swimming baths that used to be in Middlesbrough."" The only indication of the gallery's knock-on effect on the nearby row of empty shops is a sign for a pop-up ""art and performance space"" called We Are Open, which is decidedly not. But there are other, subtle changes. ""There's an element of town pride that goes along with having something that isn't Middlesbrough, known for the smoke, the pollution, the general urban decay,"" says Chris Neale, a bank worker on his lunch break in the square. And at the railway station, a smaller gallery space called Platform A has been open for a year alongside studios for 15 artists. Artist and founder Tony Charles says Mima's arrival made others realise that the council was receptive to creative ideas. It has also given the university's fine art graduates a reason to stick around. ""Since we've become established here, we can see other people following our example and starting to set things up themselves,"" he says. ""It all contributes to the creative maturing process of Middlesbrough. ""Now, it's not unusual to be talking to an artist in Middlesbrough in the middle of the street. There are plenty of them. Whereas years ago, before Mima, they were a rare breed."" Two of the most recent additions to the gallery circuit are the Hepworth Wakefield and Turner Contemporary in Margate, both designed by David Chipperfield, which each boasted 500,000 visitors in their first years - far exceeding expectations. But are those visitors also spending time and money in the area, or just visiting the galleries before going straight home? In Wakefield, the gallery estimates that its visitors each spent an average of £20 in the town, bringing in £10m to the local economy. Wakefield Express editor Mark Bradley says opinion in the city is still not ""unequivocally positive"", but that the gallery has won over many critics. ""I've been into various shops in Wakey - sandwich shops, coffee shops, places like that - where they've said that they have had people that aren't from Wakefield discussing their visit to the Hepworth. ""At the outset, there were a lot of people saying 'People are just going to go to the Hepworth and then leave Wakefield'. But I don't believe that's true. I think a lot of people are sticking around a bit."" High-profile galleries may offer a ""very quick visible fix"" for councils looking to address problems, according to Professor Malcolm Miles of the University of Plymouth, but they cannot make much difference on their own. There must be other attractions to draw in visitors, and other forms of regeneration to really improve an area, he believes. The New Art Gallery in Walsall, which opened in 2000, is one that struggled in its early years. ""The time I went there, I was the only visitor for quite a long period,"" Professor Miles says. ""The building really stands out in the environment around it as the only element of regeneration there. It's too isolated. ""And it's so near Birmingham, which has a lot more. People will go into Birmingham and not Walsall. Which is a pity because there were a lot of positive aspects about the building and what's inside it. These are well intentioned initiatives but they're sometimes rather naive."" New Art Gallery director Stephen Snoddy says the venue had 175,000 visitors in 2011 and that new flats, shops and a hotel had now been built nearby. The new galleries have certainly loosened London's monopoly on contemporary art. Funding from councils and other sources is being squeezed, though, and Arts Council England has decided to focus capital money on improving existing buildings rather than putting up new ones. The galleries from Wakefield to Margate are among the last of their generation, and must now prove their worth in the long run, just as the Baltic appears to be doing.","Over the past decade, bold and costly new art galleries have sprung up in towns from Margate to Middlesbrough in the hope of regenerating underloved areas and bringing modern art to the masses. Has the strategy worked?"
"By Tim MastersArts and entertainment correspondent, BBC News The House of Illustration opened to the public on Wednesday near London's King's Cross. ""Illustration has been one of the most distinctive strands in the history of British art,"" Sir Quentin said. ""It's one of the things that the British are good at - we don't say that often enough."" Described as the world's first public gallery and education space dedicated to illustration, the new venue will feature many forms of drawing such as political cartoons, advertisements, scientific drawings and fashion designs. Its inaugural exhibition, Inside Stories, celebrates Quentin Blake's long career. It features drafts and original art for several books including Roald Dahl's The Twits and Danny, the Champion of the World. ""The two books are such a contrast,"" Sir Quentin told the BBC. ""One of the things that was interesting about working with [Roald Dahl] was you never knew what the next book was going to be."" Other books featured in the show are The Boy in The Dress by David Walliams and Michael Rosen's Sad Book. Born in 1932, Sir Quentin's first drawings were published in Punch when he was 16. His first children's book was John Yeoman's A Drink of Water in 1960. For many years he taught at the Royal College of Art, became the inaugural children's laureate in 1999 and was knighted in 2012. Sir Quentin said he felt a ""tinge of incredulity"" to be standing in the new art space after years of fundraising, which included an auction of works by fellow artists at Sotheby's in 2010. ""The entrance room is a drawing of my studio, so I really do feel at home,"" he said. ""Illustration is around us everywhere, but what I hope is that here you will stop and think about it."" Inside Stories is at The House of Illustration until 2 November.","Sir Quentin Blake, best known for his illustrations in the books of Roald Dahl, has launched a unique gallery dedicated to the art form."

"By Tim MastersArts and entertainment correspondent Lone Scherfig's period comedic drama Their Finest tells the story of a group of filmmakers making a film to boost morale during World War Two. Arterton plays Catrin Cole, a screenwriter hired to bring a female perspective to war films produced by the British Ministry of Information. The film had its gala screening the BFI London Film Festival on Thursday night. The film shows how she has to put up with a lower salary than her male counterparts and has to fight pressure to dilute the female roles in her screenplay. In the film, the female dialogue is referred to as ""slop"" - a term used in some film-making circles at the time. ""It's obviously sexist,"" Arterton said ahead of the screening, ""but funnily enough for Catrin I don't think she's aware of it. I think at that time it was just kind of accepted."" She added: ""What I like about Catrin is that she is a feminist and she doesn't know it yet."" Arterton stars in the film alongside Bill Nighy, who plays a fading movie actor, and Hunger Games star Sam Claflin as Catrin's colleague at the ministry. Their Finest is Danish film-maker Scherfig's fifth film set in the UK. Her other films include An Education and The Riot Club. ""I never felt this that film was primarily a feminist film,"" Scherfig told the BBC. ""The whole story of a woman finding out what she can do and gaining respect for it is definitely the main plot but the whole package - about London and the film industry - is what gives the film its depth and complexity."" Producer Stephen Woolley said he had loved making a film about a time when making films was so important. ""When they made films in the 1940s it was a matter of life and death. They had no idea if they'd have a film set or any actors the next day, or if the Germans had invaded... ""They look a bit corny now, but those films were so important.

Actor David Hasselhoff had some trouble working out how to hand over the best female trophy to the 25-year-old star. ""I was trying to find her hand but I ended up having to hold the award,"" he said. ""I was just trying to figure out 'what do I do here?' But she is lovely."" Other winners were Katy Perry, who received the best live act accolade, Eminem, who won best hip-hop and Linkin Park, who beat Coldplay to take home best rock. Queen received the global icon award, with band members Brian May and Roger Taylor picking up their honour on the night. At the same time as the main awards ceremony in the Odyssey Arena, Northern Ireland band Snow Patrol were playing a free gig to 15,000 people at City Hall, with Red Hot Chili Peppers performing at the Ulster Hall. The ceremony opened with Coldplay performing Every Teardrop Is A Waterfall. It also included a tribute to singer Amy Winehouse, who was found dead at her home in London in July. An emotional Jessie J presented the tribute, and said the Brit and Grammy award-winner had been an inspiration to her. ""I never got to thank Amy for breaking boundaries as I truly believe without her I wouldn't be standing here today,"" she said. ""She set a new standard for British female artists."" This reverential tone was not the dominant theme of the ceremony, however. Lady Gaga rivalled host Selena Gomez in her ability to change outfits and at one stage perched herself on a model of a moon. Jessie J burst out of a giant safe to deliver her song Price Tag and at one point, a streaker bound on to the stage and exchanged words with US actress Hayden Panettiere. Dream Ms Panettiere said it was ""definitely the most surprising award show I've ever been to"". Earlier, Snow Patrol frontman Gary Lightbody had said Belfast was ""literally vibrating with joy"" at staging the event. ""It is great that Northern Ireland is getting an international spotlight thrown at it in such a positive way,"" he said. Mr Lightbody, who is from Bangor, County Down, said it was an ""incredible opportunity for people to think about the music in Northern Ireland"". ""The list is endless of new bands at the moment and it is great that MTV have taken their cameras around some of the smaller gigs as well over the past week,"" he said. The singer, whose hits include Chasing Cars and Run, added: ""It's kind of a dream to stop the traffic in Belfast. ""Very often Northern Ireland in the past has been in the news for other reasons and this is a really, really amazingly positive reason to be in the news."" Selena Gomez, whose boyfriend Justin Bieber performed at the show said it was a ""huge honour"" to have been given the role. The European branch of the MTV Awards is generally more relaxed and off-the-cuff than the bigger, American version. The ceremony lands at a different destination every year, from Berlin to Madrid. Belfast is the smallest host city so far. Courtship Organisers said there had been a ""10-year courtship"" between the council and MTV. Previously, it had been felt that Belfast's infrastructure could not cope with the demands of a show that requires 39 separate hotels to house personnel from production crews to celebrity entourages. ""It's a multi-million dollar event,"" MTV's Richard Godfrey said. ""It's the most ambitious show we've done for a long time."" Belfast City Council believes the ceremony could generate £10 million in tourism revenues, while a specially organised Belfast Music Festival in the run-up to the show saw several local bands sign management and record deals. Gary Lightbody said: ""I hope this will speed things up for them. ""Snow Patrol went through 10 years of not selling any records. I'd love that not to happen to any of these bands.""","Lady Gaga has dominated the MTV Europe Music Awards in Belfast, collecting four prizes in a range of outfits."
"By Neil SmithArts reporter, BBC News Born in Rochdale in 1969, the 44-year-old former banker has been promoted from his previous role as Financial Secretary to the Treasury. A lot will be waiting for this bus driver's son at the Department of Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS). But what should be top of his list of priorities? The BBC News website asked the editors of four publications that focus on the arts and the creative industries what their readers want from him. FILM - Wendy Mitchell, editor, Screen International I think what the UK film industry wants most from government is a sense of stability, particularly in the continuation of the tax credit for film, which is an essential piece of the puzzle for keeping the British film industry surviving and thriving. What would be disastrous is if the new minister would make any sort of rash decision without consulting industry, the way Jeremy Hunt did in suddenly abolishing the UK Film Council. Now that the BFI is the lead agency for film, they need to be allowed to just get on with the jobs at hand. Chris Smith's film policy review and its follow-up review have laid out a clear plan of action. The hope is that any new minister will help the experts get on with that plan, not muddy the waters with their own input at this stage. It has to be said that culture minister Ed Vaizey has been a consistent and interested governmental voice about the film industry for a number of years. That's an asset for a new culture secretary, to have Vaizey's perspective after he's taken a genuine interest in understanding the industry. But in short, the tax credit's stability, or even furthering it as recently proposed, is the most important thing that the culture secretary needs to protect. I think the vast majority of people in the music industry are pretty sick and tired of seeing music not regarded as one of the government's favoured creative industries. Video games, TV and the animation industry all recently won tax relief in an announcement that was supposed to cover all the creative industries. Music once again was forgotten in that round. The industry has obviously been very hurt by copyright infringement over the past 15 years, particularly online. I think it's fair to say it would like to see action from government to assist with that. UK music as a net export is a huge success story for the UK and they would also like to see that reflected in policy making. I think it will be a huge relief if Sajid Javid acknowledged the music industry alongside the more tech-touched industries that have a sort of halo effect around them at the moment, from video games to animation to online programme making. There seems to be a belief within the current government that the UK tech industries are the only area for growth. But without content and without owning the rights to the things people want to be entertained by and engaged with, you don't have an industry. That's a message the music industry will want the culture secretary to be driving home at cabinet meetings. Music content is more widely listened to than ever before and the industry just wants to see it protected. We've seen Adele and Ed Sheeran and other artists emerge on the world stage in the last five years, so it would also be lovely to see if some sort of tax relief could help bring through the next era of British artists. In terms of theatre and the performing arts, I would say getting the proposed tax relief that's coming in later this year right and making sure the details are ironed out and making sure it's the one that works best for the sector has got to be near the top of his list. The last budget announced a brand new tax relief for theatre investment along the lines of the film tax relief that already exists. It's a Treasury document so it won't be directly Sajid Javid's brief. But it is his sector that it's going to affect, so I would have thought he'll be involved in getting it put through. Another area that Maria Miller wasn't as active in as she could have been, was the role of the DCMS in encouraging local authorities to fund culture. If there's one big funding issue in the arts from a theatre point of view, it's local council funding. I don't think enough has been done to encourage local authorities to continue their support for the arts. The third thing is working with the Department of Education to ensure that funding levels at arts training institutions are retained as much as possible, because a lot of drama schools are feeling the pinch at the moment. Hopefully the new culture secretary can bring some knowledge of how the Treasury works into the arts sector, to help it make a better case for funding and make the argument in a way the Treasury understands. The first thing is it's important to appear interested. It's important to be seen at things, to go and visit things and get to know the art world. And it's important not just to be seen at the National Gallery or the Tate, but to take some time to visit small arts organisations out in the regions. It helps a lot if the impression is that the culture secretary is genuinely interested - that always wins friends. Number two is obviously the issues around funding. The Conservative Party has increasingly started talking the language of art and the economy; they seem to see it very much from the economic aspect. Now art does have an economic value, but I think people feel in our world that arts offer more than economic value. Museums, art exhibitions, cultural events have a social benefit, an educational benefit, and I think it would be good for the secretary to understand that. Abroad, this is what we're known for. People like Thomas Heatherwick, Jonathan Ive, all the YBAs [Young British Artists] - people know who they are. Abroad, our art output is seen as a very important thing. But those people nearly all grew up at a time when art school was relatively cheap to go to and it was less of a risk. Becoming a really good artist is a long slow and painful process and it would be good for that to be understood. That's something the art world in the UK feels has got lost in the mix. I think we want a culture secretary who would be looking to protect the Arts Council and museums from any other cuts, and who really understands the educational and social benefit of the arts, from school to museum-visiting as an adult. There's also the issue around smaller arts organisations that tend to get funded through local authority budgets. There have been cuts at the local authority level that have affected arts in the region quite badly, and there's a general feeling that the regions have slid down the priority list. The minister could also do his best to persuade the Treasury to make it more attractive for the very wealthy to donate money and art, and not just to big institutions like the Tate. They should also be encouraged to give more money to museums and organisations in the regions. And there's one final point. We really ought to sign the Hague Convention, which is all about the protection of heritage in war-torn countries. I know there have been cross-party moves to get the convention signed, but we haven't signed it. It's something the DCMS could take a lead on, in tandem with the Foreign Office.","Sajid Javid, the Conservative MP for Bromsgrove, has been appointed culture secretary by David Cameron following the resignation of Maria Miller."
"By Lizo MzimbaEntertainment correspondent, BBC News The pair were both Oscar-nominated for 2014's The Theory of Everything with Redmayne winning for his portrayal of physicist Stephen Hawking. This year's festival will host the European premiere of The Aeronauts. It tells the story of an attempt to fly a gas balloon higher than anyone has before. It was previously been announced the 11-day long celebration of film will open and close with two other European premieres - Armando Iannucci's The Personal History of David Copperfield and Martin Scorsese's mob epic The Irishman, which stars Oscar winners Robert de Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci. Other films that will be shown during the Festival include whodunit mystery Knives Out, starring Daniel Craig and Avengers star Chris Evans, and The King, an adaptation of Shakespeare's Henry IV Parts One and Two and Henry V, starring Timothée Chalamet and Robert Pattinson. There will also be Gala Premieres of Avengers star Scarlett Johansson's two most recent movies, the wartime satire Jojo Rabbit, where she plays the mother of a young boy whose imaginary friend is an idiotic version of Hitler, and Marriage Story where she stars opposite Star Wars actor Adam Driver in the story of a couple's difficult break up. The festival will screen a total of 229 features with around one in three of those coming from female film-makers representing a slight increase from last 2018's programme. LFF Director Tricia Tuttle said LFF doesn't operate a quota and the proportion reflects the strength of female emerging talent. ""We would all have been disappointed if it was less than last year, because there are more great films being made by female film makers. We want to see that reflected in the programme,"" she said. Tuttle acknowledged the whole industry does need to do more, particularly with its most high profile releases. ""When you look at films that are probably going to be competing in that major awards season space, [there are] still very few films by female filmmakers,"" she said. ""And I think this is down to the glass ceiling for female filmmakers not being funded at the same level male film makers are being invested in."" Among the films directed by female film makers being screened at this year's LFF are Mirrah Foulkes's live action recreation of the famous puppet show Judy & Punch, Sarah Gavron's London-based teen drama Rocks about a young girl facing tough challenges in her home life, and Marielle Heller's A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood starring Tom Hanks and Matthew Rhys. Heller's previous film Can You Ever Forgive Me? played at 2018's festival. Other potential highlights include Our Ladies, the big screen version of Alan Warner's riotous novel about a group of schoolgirls competing in a choir competition. The story has previously been adapted for stage in the Olivier award-winning Our Ladies of Perpetual Succour. The London Film Festival runs between Wednesday 2 October and Sunday 13th October.",Felicity Jones and Eddie Redmayne will be reunited on screen at this year's BFI London Film Festival in adventure movie The Aeronauts.
"Seyi Omooba was due to play the lead character, Celie, in The Color Purple at Leicester's Curve Theatre in 2019. Ms Omooba, who is Christian, would have refused the role if she'd known the character was gay, the tribunal heard. However, her lawyers argued that Celie's sexuality was ambiguous. Ms Omooba, from east London, was originally dismissed over comments she posted to Facebook in 2014. The 26-year-old said she did ""not believe you can be born gay"" and that homosexuality was wrong even ""though the law of this land has made it legal"". At the time the show's producers wrote in a statement: ""Following careful reflection it has been decided that Seyi will no longer be involved with the production."" Ms Omooba is suing the Leicester Theatre Trust and her agents Michael Garrett Associates Ltd (Global Artists) for around £128,000 over her sacking, on the grounds of religious discrimination and a breach of contract. A separate tribunal against the musical's co-producers, The Birmingham Hippodrome, was dropped last year, after Ms Omooba accepted they ""only played a minor role"" in her dismissal. 'Best known interpretation' The Color Purple is based on Alice Walker's Pulitzer prize-winning 1982 novel of the same name. It tells the tale of Celie, a poor, young, abused African-American women in the southern United States in the 1930s. As the story progresses, she develops a close and sexual relationship with a female blues and jazz singer, named Shug Avery. Ms Omooba's representative, Pavel Stroilov, said ""the best known interpretation"" of the character is to be found in Steven Spielberg's later film version. On Monday, the Central London Employment Tribunal heard how Ms Omooba had previously told her agents she would not play a gay role; and that in the production in question she was ""never asked explicitly to play this character as a lesbian"". ""In the film the lesbian theme is not present at all, there is one kiss between the female characters which can be interpreted in all sorts of ways,"" said Mr Stroilov. ""It is in no way obvious and was never made clear to claimant that she was expected to play a lesbian character."" He added: ""It's, with respect, absurd to suggest it's for an employee, an actor, to go and inquire with an employer whether or not they interpret this play differently from Steven Spielberg."" 'Resign or be dismissed' Representing the Leicester Theatre Trust, Tom Coghlin QC noted: ""The musical is not the film, they are different works with a common source, which is the novel."" He suggested Ms Omooba ""didn't check"" with the director as to whether Celie would be interpreted ""in the usually understood way, which was as a gay character"". Mr Coghlin added that the actor's stance constituted a ""repudiatory breach of contract"" and that her dismissal was therefore not ""unwanted conduct"". ""The role that she complains about being dismissed from is one that she would have refused to play in any event,"" he suggested. ""Her choice was to resign or be dismissed and she chose to be dismissed."" Ms Omooba is being represented by the legal arm of Christian Concern, an organisation co-founded by her father, pastor Ade Omooba MBE. The group said the case ""will expose the mechanisms of censorship at the heart of the theatre industry"", adding that ""any dissenting views against LGBT ideology, especially Christian beliefs, are currently incompatible with a theatrical career"".

"Lionsgate is remaking the 1987 film that starred Jennifer Grey opposite Patrick Swayze. Kenny Ortega, who choreographed the original, directed Michael Jackson movie This Is It and High School Musical, will direct the remake. ""The opportunity to direct Dirty Dancing is like returning home for me,"" Ortega told film magazine Variety. ""I am looking forward to assembling a great creative team and an exciting cast to bring Dirty Dancing to the screen for a new generation. ""Patrick Swayze set the bar for men dancing in movies as Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire did before him,"" he added. The original romantic movie, which was set in the 1960s, tells the story of a teenage girl who falls in love with her dance teacher while on holiday with her family. The accompanying soundtrack was a big success and included number one hits such as Time of my Life and Hungry Eyes. It has since been made into a successful stage show, and after a five-year run in the West End which ended in July, the musical begins a tour of the UK in September. Grey, 51, who played Baby in the original film, was crowned the winner of US show Dancing with the Stars last year. Swayze, who played Johnny, died of pancreatic cancer in September 2009 at the age of 57.","Hit 1980s film Dirty Dancing is to return to the big screen, a Hollywood film studio has said."
"For his many supporters, his fiction had merciless comic clarity and his travel writing a terrifying honesty - refusing to glamorise or idealise the developing world. They hailed him as a towering intellect - delivering an original, scorching critique refreshingly devoid of political correctness: attacking the cruelty of Islam, the corruption of Africa and the self-inflicted misery he witnessed in the poorest parts of the globe. For his numerous critics, Naipaul's writing was troubling and even bigoted. They recognised his literary gifts but saw him as a hater: an Uncle Tom who dealt in stereotypes, paraded his prejudices and bathed in loathing for the world from which he came. Certainly, he gave cause for their grievance. ""There probably has been no imperialism like that of Islam and the Arabs"", he once declared. He was scornful of the Caribbean, wrote that Africa would revert to the 'bush' and often veered towards unapologetic misogyny. ""I read a piece of writing and, within a paragraph or two, I know whether it is by a woman or not,"" he told one interviewer. ""I think (they are) unequal to me."" Women were narrow and overly sentimental, he declared. Jane Austen, especially, did not come up to snuff. His fellow Nobel Prize winner, Derek Walcott, was scathing. Naipaul wrote beautiful prose, he said, ""scarred by scrofula"" and ""a repulsion towards Negroes... a physical and historical abhorrence that, like every prejudice, disfigures the observer"". The academic, Edward Said, bridled at the attacks on Islam - saying he found it hard to believe any rational person would attack entire cultures on such a scale. In person, Sir Vidia could be affable. But, just as often, he was as haughty, irascible and quickly provoked to bile. He enjoyed epic feuds with friend and foe, acted unspeakably to women and gloried in a general lack of sensitivity to all who crossed his path. When Salman Rushdie went into hiding after The Satanic Verses, for instance, Naipaul described the fatwa as ""an extreme form of literary criticism."" Then he threw back his head and laughed. Trinidad Vidiadhar Surajprasad Naipaul was born in rural Trinidad on 17 August 1932. The island of his birth was a complicated post-colonial patchwork of racial tensions and subtle hierarchies. His grandparents had been labourers: part of the great nineteenth-century Indian diaspora who had settled in the Caribbean. The young Vidia was raised as a Hindu, part of a displaced community within a plantation society. It was a blend of histories, customs and ethnic identities which later formed an important part of his work. Naipaul's father, Seepersad, was a journalist for the Trinidad Guardian who revered Shakespeare and Dickens. He would read the great works of European literature aloud to his children - giving the young Vidia a burning ambition for writing, a ""fantasy of nobility"" and a ""panic about failing."". He attended the Queen's Royal College, proving himself an able student. On graduating, he won a government scholarship giving him entry to the Commonwealth university of his choosing. In 1950, he arrived in Oxford. Depression University College was a time of poverty and terrible loneliness. Isolated and unsure of his future, Naipaul became severely depressed. On an impulse, he took a trip to Spain where he quickly ran out of money. There was a frustrated suicide attempt when the gas meter ran out. His saviour was his father, with whom he kept in touch by letter: a correspondence Naipaul later published as Letters Between a Father and a Son (1999). He harboured little affection for his homeland, describing Trinidad as an ""unimportant, uncreative, cynical... dot on the map"". But nor did he warm to Britain either, finding it a second-rate country of ""bum politicians, scruffy writers and crooked aristocrats."" He moved to London with his new wife, Patricia Hale - who he had met at college. His father died and Naipaul found himself in yet another small, isolated world - this time as an aspiring writer. ""I became my flat, my desk, my name."" With a growing emotional and physical detachment, he began to write about his childhood. His first three books - The Mystic Masseur (1957), The Suffrage of Elvira (1958) and Miguel Street (1959) - were set in the Caribbean and published in quick succession. To support himself, he churned out book reviews and made programmes for the radio. ""I was,"" he said, ""an accomplished hack."" Masterpiece Then came his undoubted masterpiece. A House for Mr Biswas took more than three years to write and, by the time of completion, he knew much of it by heart. But beneath the masterful comic writing lay such a series of raw emotions, he barely ever looked at it again. It was a sprawling, Dickensian family chronicle about one man's dreams of independence. Mr Biswas was from Trinidad, continually striving for elusive success. He marries into an overbearing family but, without a house, cannot be the author of his own destiny. He struggles to build it; casting off his decaying relations, creating his freedom and establishing self-respect. Above all, it was the writer's attempt to come to terms with his own identity and the pivotal figure in his life: his father. Biswas represented Seepersad while the character's son, Anand, stood for himself. About their relationship, Naipaul wrote barely disguised self-analysis in the form of fiction - with sharp sentences and a merciless pen: ""Though no one recognized his strength, Anand was amongst the strong. His satirical sense kept him aloof. At first this was only a pose, an imitation of his father. But satire led to contempt... It led to inadequacies, to self-awareness and a lasting loneliness. But it made him unassailable."" The book was a sensation, published to global acclaim in 1961. But Naipaul felt exhausted and done, for now, with writing literature. He spent the next few years travelling in the Caribbean, India and Africa - describing what he saw and reaching for a greater understanding of his own, displaced identity. Global traveller His writings offer a personal notion of history as a series of tragic and haphazard upheavals, leaving ""half-made"" developing worlds in their wake. An Area of Darkness (1964) chronicles India. Naipaul has only contempt for westerners looking to the sub-continent for a spiritual awakening. Instead, he saw only ugliness and a smug refusal to recognise the horror of the ""narrow, broken lanes with green slime in the gutters, the chocked back-to-back houses, the jumble of filth and food and animals and people, the baby in the dust, swollen-bellied, black with flies, but wearing its good-luck amulet"". In Africa, he took up a writer-in-residence fellowship at a university in Uganda - writing The Mimic Men (1967): a novel charting the struggles of Ranjit 'Ralph' Singh to balance his personal life and political ambition. Combining elements of both fiction and non-fiction, it satirised, as the title suggests, West Indian efforts to mimic the behaviour of their former European masters. He travelled widely about the continent, often depicting its life as bleak and its people primitive. In A Free State (1971) won the Booker Prize with its portrayal of a violent, post-colonial continent attracting young, idealistic whites in search of sexual freedom. A young American, Paul Theroux, often joined him on his journeys. Years later, Theroux discovered a book he had given Naipaul in a second-hand bookshop. Offended, he published Sir Vidia's Shadow, a book depicting his former friend as ""a grouch, a skinflint, tantrum-prone, with race on the brain"". The result was an epically bitter 15-year feud. Naipaul's career saw bursts of stunning creativity laced with long periods of writer's block. Highlights included The Loss of Eldorado (1969), Guerillas (1975) and A Bend In The River (1979) - a picture of post-colonial Africa spiralling into hell. Its first line captures Naipaul's belief that the world is what man makes it; responsibility for its failings impossible to escape: ""The world is what it is"", he wrote. ""Men who are nothing, who allow themselves to become nothing, have no place it it."" He swung his gaze on Islamic fundamentalism in the Believers (1981). One New York Times writer observed that it bore an antipathy to the religion so naked ""that a book taking a comparable view of Christianity or Judaism would have been hard put to find a publisher"" in America. In his later years, he entered an autumnal phase with The Enigma of Arrival (1987) and A Way in the World (1994), combining personal experience (though denying it was autobiographical) with the broad historical sweep of post-war migration from developing world. Nobel Prize A knighthood followed. And In 2001, he received the Nobel Prize for Literature. The Academy compared him to Joseph Conrad and extolled his ability to ""transform rage into precision."" He rarely gave interviews, loathing journalists. On the rare occasion he did, he invariably proved great copy: gaily describing Tony Blair as a ""pirate"" whose ""socialist revolution"" created a ""plebeian culture"", dismissing Dickens as a writer who died of ""self parody"" and skewering EM Forster as a man who knew nothing about India ""but the garden boys whom he wished to seduce."" Sir Vidia Naipaul will be remembered as a magical craftsman of English prose. He also believed the novel is ""dead"". He leaves behind a complex, challenging library of work which - despairing of the limitations of fiction to describe reality - occupies a space between imagination, travel-writing and autobiography in his attempt to capture the complexities of the modern world. He saw himself as a lone, stateless observer; free of ideology, politics and illusion. To his champions, he had few equals. For the Turkish writer Orhan Pamuk, Naipaul represented third-world people ""not with sugary magic realism but with their demons, their misdeeds and horrors - which made them less victims and more human."" But to his detractors, Naipaul was essentially political; bearing witness against the post-colonial world with great writing but shielded from criticism by virtue of being 'one of them'.","It is universally agreed that Sir Vidia Naipaul was a great writer of the English sentence; a master stylist and story-teller with a cold, clear eye for the ironies, tragedies and sufferings of mankind. But here all agreement stops."
"By Mark SavageMusic reporter He was a proudly progressive composer, drawing on any genre that came to mind - from the hippy folk of Space Oddity to the crunching industrial rock of 1995's Outside album and his ambitious, jazz-flecked swansong Blackstar, released just last week. His style shifted with the sands, but he was always recognisably David Bowie. That powdery voice - vibrating off the back of his teeth - is unmistakable; while his impressionist lyrics had a constant theme - he was an outsider, an alien, a sexually ambiguous spectre. A trained mime, he embraced the theatre of pop music - combining Japanese Kabuki theatre, the science fiction of Stanley Kubrick and a truck-load of eye-liner to create his first great character, Ziggy Stardust. ""I am an actor,"" he once said. ""My whole professional life is an act."" From the sexually liberated vantage point of 2016, it is easy to forget how bizarre and outrageous Bowie seemed in the 1970s. In a drab musical landscape he was fey, colourful and androgynous. And his eye-catching performance of Starman on Top Of The Pops in July 1972, one arm draped around guitarist Mick Ronson, seems tame now, but it was scandalous at the time. ""Next day, all hell broke loose in the playground,"" recalled singer Marc Almond. ""Bowie was a queer and if you liked him, you must be queer, too"". For others, though, Bowie's admission of bisexuality was a lifeline. ""Until he turned up, it was a nightmare,"" said Ian McCulloch, lead singer of Echo and the Bunnymen. ""In 1972, I'd get girls on the bus saying to me, 'Eh, have you got lippy on?' or 'Are you a boy or a girl?' ""[He] made me feel cooler... it helped forge an identity and a perspective on things, helped us walk taller."" Also paying attention was a young Stephen Morrissey, who later recalled: ""Manchester then was full of bootboys and skinheads and macho-macho thugs. I saw Bowie's appearance as the ultimate bravery. ""He was so important to me because his vocal melodies were so strong and his appearance was so confrontational."" The star later hired Mick Ronson to produce his third solo album, Your Arsenal - and got the chance to discuss sexual politics on tour with Bowie in 1995. ""David quietly tells me, 'You know, I've had so much sex and drugs that I can't believe I'm still alive,'"" wrote Morrissey in his autobiography. ""And I loudly tell him, 'You know, I've had so little sex and drugs that I can't believe I'm still alive."" It wasn't just British musicians who were inspired by Bowie's boundary breaking. Madonna, who has single-handedly reinvented the modern arena concert, says Bowie taught her everything. Here is the speech she gave while inducting Bowie to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996. ""Before I saw David Bowie live, I was just your normal, dysfunctional, rebellious teenager from the Midwest, and he has truly changed my life. It was the first rock concert that I ever saw and it was a major event in my life. I planned for months to go and see it. I was 15 years old, it was the end of the school year, and leading up to the week of the show, I begged my father and he said, 'I absolutely refuse, over my dead body, you're not going there, that's where horrible people hang out,' so of course I had to go. ""So my best friend spent the night at my house and when we thought everyone was asleep, we snuck out of my window, which was no mean feat, as I was wearing my highest platform shoes and a long black silk cape. Don't ask. We couldn't drive, so we hitch-hiked into Detroit and I don't know who was scarier... the drivers that picked us up, or us in our outfits. Anyway, we arrived and Kobal Hall and the place was packed and we fought our way to our seats. And the show began. And I don't think that I breathed for two hours. ""It was the most amazing show that I'd ever seen, not just because the music was great, but because it was great theatre. And here's this beautiful, androgynous man, just being so perverse... as David Byrne so beautifully put it... so unconventional, defying logic and basically blowing my mind. Anyway, I came home a changed woman, as you can see, and my father was not sleeping and he knew exactly where I went, and he grounded me for the rest of the summer. ""But it was worth every minute that I sat and suffered in my house that summer."" Bowie's innovative use of fashion, lighting, dance and imagery are an important part of his legacy - but that's not to underplay the influence of his music. He had admirers in rock, punk, hip-hop and pop, while even classical composers like Philip Glass - who based two symphonies on Mr Bowie's albums Low and Heroes - were not immune to his charms. Killers star Brandon Flowers attributes his musical career to Bowie, telling The Independent: ""I still remember when I heard 'Changes' for the first time. I thought it was Bob Dylan because of the way he sings the verses. I found out it was Bowie and it was from this album called Hunky Dory. ""It's the most important record to me, ever. I appreciate that he's still able to write songs, because even when there's a rough album, there will always be that one song on there that grabs you. But Hunky Dory is the pinnacle - there's not one song I skip past."" U2 frontman Bono said his vocal style was inspired by Bowie - describing it to Rolling Stone magazine as going ""beyond your 'man' voice into the feminine"". ""It's not exaggerating to say what Elvis meant to America, David Bowie meant to the UK and Ireland,"" he added U2 also owed a debt to Bowie's most experimental phase - the trilogy of records he recorded in Berlin with Brian Eno, predominantly instrumental and characterised by Eno's minimalist electronics. The Irish band replicated Bowie's approach on their Achtung Baby album - recorded in the same studios (Hansa in Berlin) with Brian Eno in tow. It resurrected their career after the pompous, misfiring Rattle and Hum, and gave the band a second lease of life. Bowie's Berlin cycle (Low, Heroes, Lodger) is probably his most influential. It's electronic soundscapes and dystopian lyrics led directly to Joy Division's Unknown Pleasures, while Radiohead have captured a similar sense of paranoia and alienation in their later albums. Robert Smith of The Cure called Low ""the greatest record ever made"", saying his ""whole perception of sound was changed"" the first time he heard it. ""Everything on there, everything I heard was astonishing, really astonishing."" ""David Bowie is easily the most influential and important artist to come out of the UK,"" noted Johnny Marr. ""There are musicians who are influenced by him who don't even realise it. ""Ziggy Stardust and Hunky Dory liberated so many people from the straight sensibility in the suburbs. People who I grew up admiring, like Pete Shelley from the Buzzcocks or Ian Curtis, were hugely influenced by Bowie. No Bowie, no John Lydon - or lots of other people."" And the list goes on. Artists as diverse as Suede, Culture Club, Nine Inch Nails, Janelle Monae, Jay Z and the Arctic Monkeys have all cited Bowie as an influence. But perhaps the musician's most obvious modern descendant is Lady Gaga. She has called Bowie her ""alien prince,"" saying ""Every morning I wake up and I think, 'What would Bowie do?'"" Crucially, she has applied Bowie's philosophy to her own creative vision - rather than slavishly recreating one of his sounds or personas. ""What I have in common with David Bowie is the way that I combine theatrics and the visual in all of my performances. ""The fashion and the imagery and what I am trying to say as an artist goes much further beyond the music… the intention for me is not to sound just like Bowie. It is to pull references from all these different people and create something fresh and new and futuristic and pop and different."" Bowie could hardly have put it better himself.","David Bowie changed music forever. Throughout his career, he reinvented not just his sound but his persona over and over again."
"By Neil SmithEntertainment reporter ""We all really wanted to preserve her legacy and her vision,"" said singer-songwriter Sara Bareilles ahead of the show's 2019 London debut. Adrienne Shelly was found dead in her Manhattan apartment in November 2006, shortly before her film premiered. A construction worker later pleaded guilty to her manslaughter. Waitress, which had its premiere at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival, tells of a small-town pie-maker who dreams of escaping a loveless marriage. A musical version, for which Bareilles wrote the music and lyrics, opened on Broadway in April 2016. Bareilles, best known for such tracks as Love Song and Brave, said she ""did a lot of talking to Adrienne"" while writing the musical's score. ""We really wanted to honour the essence of what she made and make her presence and contribution known,"" she continued. Waitress made Broadway history by having four women - Bareilles, book writer Jessie Nelson, choreographer Lorin Latarro and director Diane Paulus - in its four main creative roles. Bareilles also stepped in to play lead character Jenna on two occasions during the show's US run, now in its third year at New York's Brooks Atkinson Theatre. The 38-year-old continued her association with musical theatre by appearing in a live TV staging of Jesus Christ Superstar and co-hosting this year's Tony Awards with Josh Groban. ""Both Josh and I have had our lives changed by our theatre experiences so it felt like a beautiful way to say thank you to the community,"" said the Grammy-nominated artist. ""There is an incredible sense of community in the theatre - a a sense of being part of something that is bigger than any one show or any one performance."" Speaking at a launch event for Waitress in central London, Bareilles said it was the eccentricity and ""messiness"" of Shelly's romantic comedy that had initially spoken to her. ""I loved that it was a story about good people who make mistakes and are doing the best they can,"" she told the BBC on Tuesday. Shelly, whose real name was Adrienne Levine, was known for her acting roles in the Hal Hartley films The Unbelievable Truth and Trust. After her death her husband, Andrew Ostroy, set up a foundation in her name to provide grants and scholarships to young female film-makers. Bareilles went on to say she would readily encourage her fellow singer-songwriters to undertake the discipline of writing a stage musical. ""I always tell my artist friends it's been the greatest love of my life,"" she said. ""I had no idea how much I would fall head over heels in love with this project. ""I got great advice when I started out from a friend of mine, who said I shouldn't be precious with my ideas but share them early and often. ""It's easy as a songwriter to keep things private until they're totally complete, but with something like this it's all about communication.""

""If you'd told my 11-year-old self I would receive an award from Stevie Wonder I'd be chuffed."" Swift was equally surprised at winning the top honour. Her album, which was released in 2014, came out too late to be eligible for last year's awards so was finally recognised at this year's ceremony. She gave a powerful acceptance speech saying: ""As the first woman to win album of the year at the Grammys twice, I want to say to young women: There are going to be people along the way who will try to undercut your success or take credit for your accomplishments or your fame. ""But if you focus on your work and don't let those people sidetrack you, someday when you get where you're going, you'll look around and you'll know it was you and the people that love you that put you there. And that will be the greatest feeling in the world."" Lamar's wins included best rap album for To Pimp A Butterfly; best rap song and rap performance for Alright; best rap/sung collaboration and best music video, which he shared with Swift for Bad Blood. Alabama Shakes were triple winners. They collected best alternative music album while their song Don't Wanna Fight won best rock song and rock performance.

Outside the main categories, Amy - Asif Kapadia's documentary on the life of Amy Winehouse - won the Grammy for best music film. Swift opened the ceremony with a rendition of her song Out of the Woods and was one of many who performed during the show, along with Lamar, Adele, Ellie Goulding, James Bay and The Weeknd. Adele's performance was slightly hampered, however, by audio problems which appeared to throw the singer. She later tweeted: ""The piano mics fell on to the piano strings, that's what the guitar sound was. It made it sound out of tune."" Rihanna had also been due to perform, but pulled out at the last minute on doctor's orders due to bronchitis. There were also a number of acts who gave tribute performances - Lady Gaga sang a medley of David Bowie songs, Jackson Browne and The Eagles performed in honour of Glenn Frey and Stevie Wonder remembered Earth Wind and Fire's Maurice White.

"Westminster Council will install one of its green plaques at 252 Regent Street, the former home of the New Argyll Rooms, which is now a bank. Commonly called Ode To Joy, the Symphony was commissioned by the Royal Philharmonic Society in 1822 and first performed in the UK on 21 March, 1825. The plaque will be unveiled by the Society's chairman on 11 August. Beethoven was paid £50 to write the symphony, and was completely deaf by the time of its completion in 1824. The choral finale incorporates and adapts Friedrich Schiller's poem Ode To Joy - an idea Beethoven had first contemplated as early as 1793, but one which was still relatively new and controversial. Following the first performance at the Argyll Rooms by conductor Sir George Smart, the work was criticised for its length and ""diffuseness"", with one critic branding it ""an unequal work, abounding more in noise, eccentricity, and confusion of design"". Twelve years passed before the Society attempted to perform it again, but it has since become one of the most beloved works in the symphonic repertoire - and is the most-requested piece of classical music on Desert Island Discs. Applause Although it received its English premiere in 1825, the official debut, with Beethoven in attendance, took place in Vienna a year earlier. According to the composer's biographer, George Grove, Beethoven was unable to hear the music, but stood next to the conductor during the performance to guide him as to the tempo. Grove wrote that, as the symphony drew to a close, Beethoven ""was not even sensible of the applause"" and ""continued standing with his back to the audience"" until one of the soloists turned him around to face the crowd. ""A volcanic explosion of sympathy and admiration followed, which was repeated again and again, and seemed as if it would never end."" Ahead of the plaque being unveiled, Chairman of the Royal Philharmonic Society John Gilhooly thanked Westminster City Council for marking the ""significant moment in London's musical heritage"". ""Buildings come and go, but the essential nature of the human spirit, which Beethoven so perfectly encapsulates in his famous symphony, remains constant,"" he added. Councillor Robert Davis, Westminster Council's deputy leader, said: ""We are delighted to be working with the Royal Philharmonic Society to honour an important moment in Britain's musical history. ""Beethoven's Ninth Symphony is considered by many to be the greatest piece of music ever written - even the original score has been added to the United Nations World Heritage List."" The unveiling ceremony will feature a performance of Joie de Vivre, a new fanfare commissioned by the Society from 18 year old composer Bertie Baigent, performed by brass players from the National Youth Orchestra.",The site of the first UK performance of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony is to be marked with a plaque.
"By Mark SavageBBC Music reporter Humility, there. Not something you always associate with Oscar-winning musicians, but that's John Legend in a nutshell. When we meet in a posh London hotel, the star offers a cup of tea, then asks if my phone needs charging (he carries a brick-sized battery with him at all times). Quietly-spoken, but sharp and intelligent, he carries none of the usual pop star baggage. There's no entourage, no sunglasses, no restrictive interview demands. As he says in one of his songs: ""I won't drink in all this fame."" The lyrics are from I Know Better, an instant highlight of Legend's new album, Darkness and Light. Co-written with Will Oldham (better known as singer-songwriter Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy) the song is a simple, gospel lament that finds Legend confessing: ""They say sing what you know - but I've sung what they want"". As the song ends, he resolves to write from the heart, then segues into one of his most political songs to date. Penthouse Floor is ""talking from the perspective of someone who lives on the wrong side of town, and is invisible to the powers that be,"" says Legend ""The only time people notice his neighbourhood is when there's a police shooting and there's protesting in the streets. ""It's a reaction to housing segregation and the ghetto-isation of certain communities - how people ignore poverty and despair in certain neighbourhoods."" We discuss this in late October, at a point when Hillary Clinton commands a lead in US opinion polls. Legend recognises that large numbers of people feel disenfranchised and ""ignored by the elites"", but he cannot foresee a Trump victory. Since the result came in, he has lambasted the president elect as a ""fantasist unmoored from reality"". His comments earned him flak on right-wing websites, while his Twitter replies are swimming in bile - but Legend is unrepentant, repeatedly warning followers to ""stay vigilant"". But the star won't be channelling that anger into his work. ""I try to write about universal themes and feelings, and when you get political, you lose some of that because people start aligning into camps,"" he says. Besides, ""it's hard to make music that says what I want to say politically, in a way that works musically"". ""If you look at what I tweet about, it's generally very policy-driven. Talking about the criminal justice system and how we need better district attorneys doesn't always work so well in a song."" Instead, he prefers social commentary over ""preachy"" polemics. Even Penthouse Floor can be mistaken for a ""sexy uptempo song"" if you don't pay attention to the lyrics, he says. Still, for those paying attention, Legend's political views are apparent: He contributed to the 12 Years A Slave soundtrack and won his Oscar for Glory, from the Martin Luther King biopic Selma. Last year, he helped produce Southside with You, a film about Barack and Michelle Obama's first date (he's not sure whether the president has seen it ""but they invited me to a state dinner the other day, so I'm pretty sure they don't hate me!""). His 2010 album, Wake Up, resurrected protest songs from the 60s and 70s, soaked in the language of the civil rights movement that felt disappointingly relevant at 30 years' distance. Recorded with hip-hop band The Roots, it remains Legend's best album since his debut, Get Lifted. He sought to recreate the gritty vibe on Darkness and Light, seeking the help of Blake Mills, a rock producer best known for his work with southern rock revivalists Alabama Shakes. ""He really pushed me,"" says Legend. ""We made choices about the instrumentation that were different to my previous solo albums. This is the first time I've worked with live drums and a consistent rhythm section for an entire album since Wake Up. ""I think we got so electronic over the last 10 years, so driven by pop and dance, that a lot of people are going back to their roots. We had a huge recession and we were making some of the most escapist pop music in that time. And now, as the economy's getting better, people are getting back to basics. ""Maybe music works like that - it's the opposite of the financial cycle."" The uncluttered, organic arrangements lend themselves to Legend's more socially-conscious songs, notably March into the Darkness, which reflects on the sacrifices made by Martin Luther King, Medgar Evers and other civil rights activists. ""What good is a dream when the dreamer dies?"" he asks in the chorus. ""I don't have any firm belief in the afterlife,"" explains the singer. ""So in the song I'm like, 'Is it worth it to die for a cause?' ""I guess my resolution at the end is, 'You know what? You got to go for it. You've got to struggle, and try to make the world better... We might as well go ahead and march into the dark.'"" Despite Legend's activism, it is love songs that have made his career - in particular All of Me, a lovestruck paean to his wife, supermodel and TV host Chrissy Teigen. When he first played it to her, she burst into tears. The rest of the world was similarly moved: All of Me spent a staggering 92 weeks in the UK singles chart and is now, according to Spotify, the fourth most-played wedding song on the planet. Legend met Teigen on the set of the video for his 2007 single Stereo and they dated for seven years before finally tying the knot on the banks of Italy's Lake Como in 2013. But in case this all sounds too perfect, watch Teigen's hilarious account of Legend's proposal. Seven months ago, the couple welcomed daughter Luna, their first child. She has inspired two songs on Darkness and Light, and even cameos in the video for Love Me Now - alongside footage of couples holding hands at the memorial outside Orlando's Pulse Nightclub, where 49 people were killed in June, and the Domiz Refugee Camp in Northern Iraq. It reflects the song's message - don't take your loved ones for granted. ""I don't know who's going to kiss you when I'm gone,"" Legend sings over percussion and piano. ""So I'm going love you now, like it's all I have."" ""Darkness is always lurking,"" says the singer. ""I'm saying, 'this might not work out, but let's enjoy it while it lasts'."" He admits there have been ""challenges"" in his relationship with Teigen, but they both ""try to work on what's wrong"". Such as? ""All of us are selfish, especially in our 20s when we're still building our career,"" he says. ""As you get older, you realise you have to care about other people's feelings. ""And then having a kid certainly changes things. They require a lot of energy and thought and time, and you can't be selfish any more."" In fact, Legend turns out to be quite the domestic demigod - thanks largely to his mother, who homeschooled the musician and his siblings (two brothers and a sister) in 1980s Ohio. ""She wanted all of her boys to be able to take care of themselves. So she made us wash our own clothes, she made us do dishes, she made us clean the bathroom. ""I'm not the best at making the bed but I love to cook with Chrissy and help her in the kitchen. I do some chopping. I boil some water. Or she'll just put me in charge of making a sauce from her book."" Ah yes, Teigen's book. It's crammed full of salty, sticky, crunchy recipes: French toast casserole; burgers with courgette fries; pizza jalapeno poppers. The sort of thing, in other words, you can't imagine crossing the lips of a couple who are photographed on a daily basis. ""Well, you have to do it in moderation,"" Legend grins. ""She's not cooking opulent meals every day. A lot of times it's just a nice fish and vegetables. ""You can't be decadent all the time."" John Legend's album, Darkness and Light, is out on Friday. He plays at the BBC Music Awards on Monday, 12 December. Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

"Disney CEO Bob Iger told ABC employees about the demand at a town hall meeting on Monday, The Hollywood Reporter said. He did not name the film, but Deadline reports that it is Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales. Mr Iger said Disney is refusing to pay, and that the studio is working with federal investigators. He added that the hackers had demanded the ransom in bitcoin and that they would release the film online in a series of 20-minute chunks unless it was paid. It is not the first film studio to be threatened with online leaks. Last month, a group of hackers uploaded the fifth season of Orange is the New Black after Netflix refused to pay a ransom. Dead Men Tell No Tales is the fifth instalment of the Pirates franchise and will see Johnny Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow return to the ocean alongside Geoffrey Rush and Orlando Bloom. It is due to be released in cinemas in the US on 26 May.

If someone has it and someone wants it then in theory there's a market for it."" Analysis - Zoe Kleinman, BBC News technology reporter It's not clear how the hackers got hold of this material - did they manage to breach Disney's hopefully robust IT security framework or was it a result of human error? Either way, the ransom tactic is popular among cyber criminals - just as we have seen with the recent ransomware attack which caused havoc around the world. The sad fact is that it's easy money for them. People often choose to pay simply because they just want their data back, whether it's a blockbuster movie or those irreplaceable family photos. These days our digital possessions are the new family silver.

"By Neil SmithEntertainment reporter, BBC News in Toronto ""It was important we had both sides, the good and the bad,"" said Idris Elba. Early scenes in Justin Chadwick's film show Mandela as a womaniser who was violent to his first wife Evelyn. ""I didn't want to deface Mr Mandela in any way,"" the Luther actor continued. ""But I didn't want to portray him in a way that wasn't honest."" Elba was speaking at the Toronto Film Festival, where Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom had its world premiere this weekend. Based on the former South African president's autobiography, the film charts his early life as a lawyer, his political activism and the 27 years of imprisonment that preceded his democratic election in 1994. Naomie Harris, also British, plays Mandela's second wife Winnie in Justin Chadwick's two-and-a-half hour drama. 'Brave choice' The film has had a mixed reception from critics, with one calling it ""more dutifully reverential than revelatory or exciting"". ""We've seen the saintly Mandela we all know and love,"" continued Elba, who did not meet ""Madiba"" before embarking on the project. ""It was important for us to take the audience on a journey prior to that and understand who he was.""

""Like everybody I've been very concerned for his health but I've been keeping optimistic,"" Elba told reporters on Sunday. According to Chadwick, the Hackney-born actor was the right person for the biopic despite being from England and bearing little physical resemblance to its subject. ""There were other obvious choices, but Idris was the brave choice,"" said the director, whose other credits include the BBC's 2005 dramatisation of Dickens' Bleak House.

""Idris managed to capture the Mandela magic,"" agreed Terry Pheto, the South African actress who plays Evelyn in the film. Industry reviews Morgan Freeman, Danny Glover, David Harewood and Sidney Poitier are among the others to have portrayed the beloved statesman on film and television. Elba, whose other films include summer blockbusters Thor and Pacific Rim, has been singled out for praise by critics who have seen the film in Toronto. ""It takes a commanding actor to fill the shoes of the man most instrumental in ending institutionalised oppression in South Africa,"" wrote David Rooney in the Hollywood Reporter. ""The charismatic Idris Elba proves equal to the task."" According to Screen International, though, the film is ""too tasteful and conventional to offer much insight into the remarkable man it wishes to celebrate"". ""It doesn't have much of a point of view about its narrative, serving more as a rote recitation of memorable moments."" Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom is one of several Toronto titles this year to draw their inspiration from real-life figures. Julian Assange, Jimi Hendrix and Britain's Got Talent winner Paul Potts also feature in films in this year's line-up. The launch of Chadwick's film coincides with the UK release of Diana, a biographical drama about Diana, Princess of Wales that drew a withering response from the British media.

"By Ian YoungsArts reporter, BBC News Part of Gormley's Another Place series, the life-size figures have been on Crosby beach in Merseyside since 2005. The head-to-toe crocheted outfits were added by New York-based artist Olek. ""I feel that barnacles provide the best cover-up, but this is very impressive substitute!"" Gormley said. One figure was given a pink, purple and green crocheted jumpsuit, while the other was clad in white, grey and black. Polish-born 34-year-old artist Agata Oleksiak, known as Olek, has previously surprised New Yorkers by giving the Wall Street bull similar treatment. She has also covered everything from cars and grand pianos to an entire apartment and its contents in her trademark colourful crochet. She said her outfits for the Gormley sculptures were ""transforming old into new"". ""I think it is his most successful installation,"" she said. ""The pieces have been there for a while and people stop paying attention to them. ""By covering them and giving them a new skin, I made them more alive... besides, it is a public work and needs an interaction with a viewer."" Gormley, who won the Turner Prize in 1994, installed 100 of the figures over a two-mile stretch of the beach. The outfits were spotted by the Liverpool Confidential website at the weekend. Olek added that she had wanted to dress all of the figures but was only in the area for one night, ""travelling in a crocheted taxi from London across UK"". She is now back in the US, installing a crocheted exhibition in Raleigh, North Carolina, before shows in Montreal and at the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington DC.","Two of sculptor Antony Gormley's iron men, which normally stand on a beach wearing nothing but rust and barnacles, have been given a multi-coloured make-over by a guerrilla knitwear artist."
"Author Colin Dexter told the Radio Times he thought ITV would ""probably do one more series"", adding he did not think the character ""can go on much longer"". A sixth series of the drama starring Kevin Whately begins next week. ITV told the BBC it had already commissioned a seventh series. Dexter, who works as a consultant on the drama, said: ""The agreement is they won't put anything on telly without me seeing it. Sometimes we have to say it's not up to scratch."" The author criticised the first two series of Lewis as being ""ridiculously complex"", but said later episodes had ""got better"". The detective drama has been on ITV1 since 2006. Whately originally starred as the sidekick of the late John Thaw in Inspector Morse. The actor told the Radio Times in January he thought the series might not last much longer.

"By Mark SavageBBC music reporter The singer told the BBC ""all her masters"" were destroyed when an archive in Los Angeles burnt down in 2008. She only discovered the loss this month, after her name was mentioned in a New York Times report that uncovered the extent of the damage. ""It absolutely grieves me,"" said Crow. ""It feels a little apocalyptic. ""I can't understand, first and foremost, how you could store anything in a vault that didn't have sprinklers. ""And secondly, I can't understand how you could make safeties [back-up copies] and have them in the same vault. I mean, what's the point? ""And thirdly, I can't understand how it's been 11 years,"" she added. ""I mean, I don't understand the cover-up."" Crow, who had seven US top 10 albums between 1995 and 2008, is the first artist to confirm the loss of their recordings since the New York Times' investigation was published two weeks ago. It detailed how the fire, which was started by overnight maintenance work, had destroyed thousands of master tapes - the original recordings from which albums and singles are made - by some of the most famous names in music history, from Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin and Chuck Berry to Janet Jackson, Nirvana and Eminem. Although the fire was widely reported at the time, Universal Music downplayed the damage to its archives, saying many of the affected tapes had duplicates in separate storage facilities. The company also disputed the New York Times' investigation, citing unspecified ""factual inaccuracies"" in the reporting. Their head archivist, Patrick Kraus, later said the extent of the losses had been ""overstated"". ""Many of the masters that were highlighted [in the report] as destroyed, we actually have in our archives,"" he told Billboard magazine. But Crow, whose biggest hits include All I Wanna Do and If It Makes You Happy, confirmed her tapes had perished, taking with them dozens of alternate takes, demos and unreleased songs. ""There are many songs on my masters that haven't come out,"" she said. ""My peace of mind in knowing I could come back someday and listen to them and mine those [sessions] for basement tapes and outtakes, are gone. ""But what grieves me more than any of that is the fact that Buddy Holly and Billie Holiday and Duke Ellington - all this important music has been erased. ""And it's not just the music, it's the dialogue between the music, it's the takes that didn't make it, it's the versions we'll never hear. ""It feels a little apocalyptic. Not to go down a weird path - but it feels like we're slowly erasing things that matter."" Legal action A group of high-profile pop musicians are currently suing Universal Music for $100m (£78m) over the loss of their master recordings. The case was filed last week in Los Angeles by the rock bands Soundgarden and Hole, singer-songwriter Steve Earle, the estate of Tupac Shakur and a former wife of Tom Petty - who accuse Universal of breaching its contracts with artists by failing to properly protect their tapes. They are seeking class action status, which means other affected artists will be able to join the case at a later date. Crow, who is not currently taking legal action, was speaking to BBC News ahead of her appearance at the Glastonbury Festival this weekend. It's her first return to Worthy Farm since 1997 - the infamous ""year of the mud"", when torrential rain, its rumoured, caused the Other Stage to start to sink into the ground. The star recalled arriving on site at 6:30 in the morning after driving through the night, ""and just stepping into knee-deep mud"". She laughed: ""It was like, 'Welcome to Glastonbury!' ""It was a great show, though. That's the thing I remember about it the most. People were covered in mud. Lots of rain slickers and just a great line-up. I remember waiting for Van Morrison to come out, and I remember seeing Beck. Just a great day."" This time around, the singer will arrive prepared. ""As soon as I'm done here, I'm getting ready to go and find some wellies,"" she said. ""I'm really looking forward to it.""

"Yet this is far from the first time his distinctive style of political satire - a fixture of national newspapers and magazines for decades - has been the subject of intense debate. Renowned for his vivid, often cruel caricatures and pointed, sometimes contentious commentary, Scarfe rarely pulls punches when it comes to depicting public figures and the political class. An early sketch of his depicting Winston Churchill in his last days as an MP was spiked by The Times, who feared his depiction of the age-ravaged former prime minister would upset Churchill's wife. In one famous illustration, published at the time of the 1963 Profumo affair, he imagined a naked Harold MacMillan sitting on a chair in a pose made famous by the model Christine Keeler. And in 1974 he marked the resignation of disgraced president Richard Nixon with a drawing that had him wiping his rear with the American flag. Born in 1936 in St John's Wood in north London, Scarfe's childhood asthma led to long periods in bed that enabled him to indulge his passion for drawing. After studying at St Martin's College of Art he got his first break with Punch, going on to work for Private Eye, the Daily Mail and Time magazine. In 1967 he began a long association with the Sunday Times as its political cartoonist. He has also worked for The New Yorker magazine for more than 20 years. Some of his most striking imagery was reserved for Margaret Thatcher, variously depicted during her premiership as a battleaxe, a blind automaton and a bloody-fanged pterodactyl. ""I could always draw her as something acerbic [and] cutting, like an axe or a knife,"" he told BBC News in 2008. ""It's great fun transmogrifying [politicians] into other objects. ""The best drawings are those which are fired by anger."" Outside of his newspaper work, Scarfe is perhaps best known for the illustrations for Pink Floyd's 1979 album The Wall and the 1982 feature film it inspired. Millions also know his work from the opening titles of Yes, Minister and Yes, Prime Minister and from Disney's 1997 animated feature Hercules. Scarfe was made a CBE in the 2008 Queen's Birthday Honours and has exhibited his work around the world. He has three children with the actress Jane Asher, whom he met in 1971 and married 10 years later.",Veteran British cartoonist Gerald Scarfe has caused controversy after a recent drawing for the Sunday Times led to accusations of anti-Semitism and an apology from Rupert Murdoch.
"Will GompertzArts editor@WillGompertzBBCon Twitter It is no longer solely defined by materials used (a painted canvas, a carved stone) but also by where something is shown. And so, an unmade bed is a slovenly disgrace at home but a $1m installation in an art gallery. Location, location, location - as the art dealers and estate agents of Mayfair like to say. It's a mantra that's given curators a new lease of life. They can now be the authors of the surprising juxtaposition, the creators of arty odd-couplings such as putting Grayson Perry's pots in the British Museum or having Banksy take over the Bristol City Museum. And now, in a similar vein, we have Jeff ""kitschy"" Koons at the venerable Ashmolean in Oxford. It is the oldest public museum in the country and the permanent home to 3,000-year-old Early Cycladic sculptures and delicate Raphael drawings, which, until 9 June, will be sharing their des-res with the American artist's giant candy-coloured, stainless-steel ""inflatables"" and mildly pornographic paintings. It is quite a coup for the Ashmo. Koons is a big-shot, celebrity artist who normally shows up at fancy modern art museums. He is not normally a provincial city sort of guy. Oxford is a-buzz. Tickets are selling fast. Expectations are high… And they will remain so as visitors encounter the first work in the first room, which is from his early 1980s Equilibrium series. The piece consists of a single basketball suspended in a tank of water like a foetus in a womb. It looks good now, but imagine how such a precise, sparse work must have appeared back in 1985 when shown in a small Manhattan gallery at a time the city was full of overblown paintings by macho neo-expressionists. It was like a palate cleanser. An unfussy sculpture that eloquently captured the spirit of Duchamp, Warhol and the 1960s minimalists (Donald Judd and Robert Morris), while pointing to a way forward in which contemporary art could continue to elevate the everyday to the eternal. One Ball Total Equilibrium Tank epitomises the best of the New York-based artist. It is deceptively simple, painstakingly executed, and intellectually ambitious: a well-balanced combination of new ideas and art historical influences. The second sculpture in the room starts to make the £12.50 ticket price look like a bargain. Rabbit (1986) is classic Koons: a 3ft high polished stainless-steel bunny made to look like a helium balloon. It is a trompe l'oeil of sorts, an illusion: a cheap, vinyl, inflatable toy that is actually the very opposite. This is pop art with a surrealist edge. Things are not what they appear to be. A children's toy laden with sexual overtones, a blow-up figure that would break your toe if dropped. Like the basketball, it has the appearance of a buoyant object full of air but would sink faster than Venezuela's economy if used as a float. And that's not a totally spurious analogy. Rabbit is partly about economics. It questions value and how it is attributed, it speaks to consumerism, and plays with the transformation of cheap, undesirable materials into a sought-after, expensive object. It is concerned with the disposable and the permanent, and, of course, context. The object, which could be mistaken for the Playboy logo, or a piece of in-store promotion, is presented as a work of art to sit alongside Michelangelo's David in the great canon of western sculpture. And then there's all the stuff about art reflecting life and life itself (you) being reflected back when looking at the Rabbit. Koons adds to these multiple interpretations by saying his ""inflatables"" are imbued with the life-giving property of air, and that ""we are all inflatables"". There's more, about Platonic forms, optimism, and self-knowledge. But enough. You can over-analyse these things and lose sight of the art. Rabbit might or might not mean some or all of these things to you. It doesn't really matter. The point is that it succeeds on its own terms, as an object with aesthetic and intellectual merit. As does Ushering in Banality (1988), in which the artist has reduced himself to a figure on a trinket pushing a pig. It is the third sculpture in the row straight out of Koons's Greatest Hits album. The ticket price is already vindicated. Which is a good thing, because a lot of what follows is… balls. Literally. There's much enjoyment to be had from looking at Jeff Koons's early works, but precious little from gazing at his balls. The bright blue orbs are dotted about like flea-bites from a hostel. They keep popping in unexpected places. The first one is sitting atop a white plaster bird bath at the end of the first gallery, striking an off note in an otherwise excellent display. Jeff Koons works in series, with this particular ""gazing ball"" chapter starting in 2013. It worked a treat when used as part of a montage he made for Lady Gaga's ArtPop album cover, but has since petered out into rather insipid installations that mark a low point in the artist's 40-year career. The third gallery is dedicated to his gazing balls. Some have been placed on plaster reproductions of statues from classical antiquity such as the Belvedere Torso, which work OK in that ""surprising juxtaposition"" sort of way, but those that have been placed in front of reproductions of famous paintings like The Tiger Hunt (1615 -16) by Peter Paul Rubens miss by several miles. Gazing Ball (Mailbox) along with the earnest exhibition label beside it, is so pompous it's unintentionally funny. No matter. The whopping stainless-steel sculptures in the second gallery amuse in a good way (unlike the unconvincing paintings lining the walls, which feel like padding). The giant magenta Balloon Venus (2008 - 12) that dominates the far end of the space will live long in the memory of Ashmo goers. It is fantastically incongruous and perfectly apt, harking back as it does to the tiny Paleolithic stone statuette known as the Venus of Willendorf. His Venus works well in the gallery. It would work even better if placed among the statues and casts from classical antiquity that are displayed in the permanent collection. Instead it shares the space with two of his monumental ballerina pieces presented in mirror-polished stainless steel. Art history is at play again, with an obvious nod to Degas, but these are also a celebration of high-tech. His team in Germany who fabricate the pieces have gone to extraordinary lengths to create seamless objects for your eyes' desire. But they're not attractive, they are spooky: massive blow-up dolls that are surrounded by porny paintings, all of which has been overseen by a very rich man well into his 60s. What was once subversive has now become crass. It's a shame. Because the show starts brilliantly, but too quickly fades into a tawdry and insipid display of very shiny but rather dull art.","Ever since that old rascal Marcel Duchamp purchased a flat-backed Bedfordshire urinal in 1917 and proclaimed it a ""readymade"" sculpture, art has become a game of context."
"By Taylor-Dior RumbleEntertainment Reporter But imagine we must, as she is now starring opposite Tom Cruise in the latest Mission: Impossible film as the White Widow. And this time round, she plays the ruler of an entirely different world as a black market arms dealer. She spoke to the BBC about swapping roles, Tom Cruise, her Emmy nomination and handing over the reins to Helena Bonham Carter. Juggling two huge jobs Kirby admits she didn't know much about the White Widow at first because the script was built around the thrilling stunts we've come to know and love and was evolving all the time. She was still filming the second series of The Crown in London when she began travelling to Paris at night to shoot Mission: Impossible - Fallout. Kirby describes the White Widow as a ""femme fatale-esque, criminal network boss"". She says: ""It was just a great challenge to try and play two completely different people and try not to be Margaret without a wig! ""It was just really lovely to join a big ensemble that's been there since 1996."" Learning the ropes from the one and only Tom Cruise At the centre of this ensemble is Tom Cruise's character, IMF agent Ethan Hunt. Kirby says: ""He's played this really iconic, very loved character and he's seen all the different incarnations of it... so to have someone at the centre of that is just really relaxing, it's like: 'Oh, cool, you know what energy works' and there's no uncertainty in the way."" As well as bringing a sense of calm to the bustling set, Vanessa also learnt a thing or two from the Hollywood veteran. ""I learnt a lot about work ethic and discipline,"" she explains. ""He's just unbelievably present and energetic and enthusiastic and doesn't let up for a second, he just loves making films. ""You just see the six-year-old in him that just absolutely loves movies and can't believe he's still making them in a way and that's so lovely to be around."" Kirby says she also picked up some health tips. ""I learnt how important physical fitness is and as an actor, to be really in touch with that, which I never even thought about before."" As well as being an award-winning star, Cruise is also a part-time daredevil and often performs death-defying stunts in many of his films, including Mission: Impossible. Fallout was no different and last year the actor made headlines for breaking his ankle during a stunt that saw him jumping between two high-rise buildings in London. Director Christopher McQuarrie told the BBC that when he went to see Cruise shortly after the accident, the first thing he was asked by the actor was: ""Did we get the shot?"" Good to know the A-lister has his priorities right. (And yes, they did get the shot). On putting down her tiara Kirby was in Paris when she found out she was nominated for the Emmy for outstanding supporting actress in a drama series. for The Crown earlier this month. ""It was a really surreal moment and very sweet and my friends were just much more emotional than I was. ""I had the best time of my life on that job, so I couldn't ask for anything else really."" Kirby has now handed over the reins to Helena Bonham Carter, who will play the princess in the third season of the Netflix drama. Kirby says she ""couldn't have thought of anyone better to take over"". ""She's just made it so nice, she's been so gracious and kind and thoughtful and mindful of it."" Kirby adds: ""She's been texting me from set actually and I've heard she's been doing little things that echo what I did in the first couple of series and stuff, so we feel really linked. ""You know when you just love a character so much and it's so part of you, oddly, because the experience was so happy, it's really cool to share it with someone,"" she explains. ""It's really unusual to do that because usually it's such an individual thing, so to be able to talk about her [Margaret] with someone else so intimately is a real gift.""

"Harry Potter And The Cursed Child came about after Sonia Friedman approached author JK Rowling and portrays the orphaned wizard as a parent himself. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, Friedman said she was ""very drawn to the notion of Harry as a dad"". She added she was ""always looking for stories that might help me understand"". Friedman, 52, said she had experienced rejection due to a lack of a relationship with her father - the acclaimed Russian violinist Leonard Friedman, who left her mother before she was born. She told Desert Island Discs presenter Kirsty Young: ""I will never understand what it would be like to have a dad, and so I'm always looking for stories that might help me understand."" Friedman this year topped the Stage 100 list of the UK's most influential people in performing arts while Harry Potter And The Cursed Child won a record-breaking nine Olivier Awards. The play was written by Jack Thorne after Rowling gave Friedman her approval to create a theatre production. Based on an original story by Rowling and John Tiffany, it is set 19 years after the final novel of the seven-book series. Friedman said she and her co-producer, Colin Callender, ""were very drawn to the notion of Harry as a dad given that he hadn't had parents of his own, and Jo [Rowling] loved that idea"". She said: ""I feel incredibly privileged and blessed that I can use my emotional background and my experiences to encourage others to put it on to paper, and then the stage."" On her own relationship with her father, Friedman said that she would meet him around ""once a year"" as a child. She said: ""I never had abandonment issues, but certainly rejection"". She added: ""I never got a birthday present from him, I never got a Christmas present from him, and I don't blame him. ""I know that as a kid he had a very difficult life. His parents pushed him to be an extraordinary musician and he was told to put the music first, to put the art first."" But Friedman said she had a ""need"" to see her father shortly before his death in 1994. ""At the end of the supper he turned to me and said, 'Sonia, I'm very proud of you',"" she said. ""Those were the last words he ever said to me. He never said I love you to me, but he did say I'm proud of you.""

"By Kev GeogheganEntertainment reporter, BBC News There is a scene in O Brother, Where Art Thou, the Coen Brothers' 2000 film based loosely on Homer's Odyssey, when George Clooney's Ulysses Everett McGill and his cronies Pete and Delmar are halted in their tracks by the haunting sounds of a trio of women, singing in harmony as they wash their clothing in the creek. The sirens, singing an old bluegrass song Nobody But The Baby, are voiced by country singers Emmylou Harris, Alison Krauss and Gillian Welch. Their exquisite acapella harmonising is a high benchmark to set but one that is being matched and, arguably, surpassed by Watford sisters, Emily, Jessica and Camilla Staveley-Taylor, better known by their bandname The Staves. ""That's a huge compliment because they are very cool,"" says middle sister Jessica. ""But we don't want to lure anyone on to the rocks."" A reluctance to lure wayward seamen to their doom aside, the clarity of the group harmonies is getting some seriously positive reviews for a band who have yet to release their debut album. In the tradition of sibling bands like The Bee Gees, it is a musical honing which comes through years performing from a young age. Emily, the eldest in the band, says: ""We've always sung together, not in a sit down and learn a song together sort of way, it was just singing along to whatever was on."" ""I think the harmonising came from a young age because our parents would harmonise together around the house,"" says Jessica. ""It sunk in because its not the most natural thing for some people to do but it wasn't really something that we had to learn how to do."" Sharing a love of old country and folk music, the band cite Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees Crosby, Stills and Nash as the benchmark by which they judge their own vocals. ""I suppose in terms of three-part harmony, their blend is just amazing and it was always something that we listened to and looked up to,"" says Camilla. It seems like an odd compliment but The Staves have been noted for their ability to silence live audiences. Luckily, the silences are the stunned-in-awe kind, rather than the hideously embarrassed kind. They have already tasted playing in front of huge audiences, supporting folk band Bon Iver on their US and European tour but say the small intimate gigs are the real challenge. Particularly when it's so quiet they can hear a pin drop. On to a carpet. In the next room. ""You can always hear people in the front row going, 'Oh I think she's the oldest... nah, I think she is...'"" says Emily. ""In a way that's the nice thing about playing in bigger places because you're further away,"" agrees Camilla. ""It's amazing how many people in the audience who think that they can't be heard or seen. ""You're like, 'Stop pointing at me and laughing'."" Emily continues: ""I saw a guy right at the back of the Sugar Club in Dublin once when it was really quiet and there was the poor guy behind the bar trying to make a cocktail (... mimes shaking a mixer really slowly) and he was going, 'I'm sorry... I'm so sorry'."" 'Ghost town' ""You can feel very exposed,"" adds Jessica, ""Anything, like your shoe creaking on the floor in the middle of a song, people can hear it and it's weird but I think there's a shared experience because the audience are in the same boat."" The band have spent much of 2012 on the road and, as such, have a list of their touring necessities. ""Tea,"" says Camilla firmly. ""Especially in America where they just don't get it. ""We've only really just got to the stage where we are asking for stuff on the rider. It used to be that we got what we'd been given, like beer. Now we normally ask for whisky, salted popcorn and bananas."" The video for the band's latest single, Tongue Behind My Teeth sees the girls as armed vigilantes in the old Wild West. ""That's normally what we do in Watford,"" insists Camilla. ""Riding around on horseback, rifle in hand, samurai sword. It's just a day in the life of a west Watford homegirl."" The video was shot in Spain, ""where they filmed a lot of these old western movies"", according to Jessica. ""The sets they made at the time have just stayed there untouched. It's incredible and quite eerie because it is literally a ghost town."" ""Not literally,"" Emily deadpans. The debut album, Dead & Born & Grown, is set for release on 12 November and has been produced by another family - father and son Glyn and Ethan Johns. Ethan Johns is known for his work with the likes of Kings of Leon and Ryan Adams and was named best British producer at this year's Brits, while father Glyn, 70, is an industry legend who produced - in amongst a long list - The Eagles' debut album, and several of The Who's albums. Emily says: ""We were talking about music and Jess started something like, 'You know, Neil Young...' and Glyn said, 'Yes, I do know Neil', and we were like, 'Of course you bloody do'. ""They're very respectful of each other, i think they're quite in awe of each other, it's quite touching to see, they're nicer to each other than we are."" The Staves also have a bit of an affiliation with the fledging UK label Communion Records, home to the likes of Ben Howard and Michael Kiwanuka, and run by Ben Lovett of British folksters Mumford and Sons who have been cutting a swathe through the lucrative US market and reigniting American passion for British singer-songwriters. It is an affiliation which will surely do The Staves no harm in the States. ""We've been lucky enough to tour with them a bit, people leave their egos and business-minds aside and we just play."" says Emily. ""We've just stumbled into it,"" says Jessica. ""Being from Watford, although it's close, it's still set apart from London. ""But they're all lovely, I think it's slightly different than indie or rock in that people are looking to collaborate and play music together.""",Watford three-piece The Staves have been silencing live audiences with their angelic harmonies ahead of the release of their debut album.
"The caption accompanied several images of cast members including star Kiernan Shipka splattered in fake blood. But many fans replied to the tweet pointing out that offence could be taken due to the the 1972 Bloody Sunday killings in Northern Ireland. Netflix later said ""we are very sorry for the hurt and distress it caused"". In a statement the streaming service added: ""Our tweet was unacceptable and has since been removed."" The caption referred to the day 13 people were killed and 15 people wounded after members of the Army's Parachute Regiment opened fire on civil rights demonstrators in the Bogside - a predominantly Catholic part of Londonderry - on Sunday 30 January 1972. The day became known as Bloody Sunday - one of the darkest days of the Northern Ireland Troubles. Sunday Bloody Sunday is also the name of a 1983 song by Irish rock band U2, which was written about the Troubles and taken from their third album War. After the tweet was published on the Sabrina Twitter account, several users encouraged Netflix to research the history of Bloody Sunday and remove the post. Chilling Adventures of Sabrina examines the origin and adventures of Sabrina the Teenage Witch in a dark and supernatural coming-of-age drama. The show's fourth and final series launched on Netflix at the end of last year. The original Sabrina the Teenage Witch starred Melissa Joan Hart and aired from 1996 to 2003. 'Instantly recognisable phrase' The story of Bloody Sunday has been told, and retold, many times and in many ways since 30 January 1972. Singers, songwriters, playwrights, poets, novelists, artists and filmmakers have all created their own interpretations of what happened that day, making ""Bloody Sunday"" an instantly recognisable phrase. In the 1980's, U2's ""Sunday Bloody Sunday"" made the Bogside familiar to a worldwide audience - and linked the 13 deaths to a global call for peace. For artists from John Lennon and Paul McCartney to Christy Moore and the Wolfe Tones, Bloody Sunday was the catalyst for anti-Troubles songs, while playwright Brian Friel modified his 1972 play 'Freedom of the City' - set in Derry's Guildhall - to include references to Bloody Sunday. More recently, two 2002 films - Paul Greengrass's ""Bloody Sunday"" starring James Nesbitt, and ""Sunday"", written by Jimmy McGovern - brought the events of 30 January 1972 to cinema and TV.

"By Ian YoungsEntertainment reporter, BBC News The band were at the forefront of the Liverpool scene but never made it big. The tapes were recorded in March 1960, two years before Starr was poached by Brian Epstein to join The Beatles. Found in Storm's sister's cellar, the tapes will form the group's first and only album release later this month. Starr joined the group at the age of 18 in 1959, but the band got left behind during the Merseybeat boom in the wake of The Beatles' success. They only released a couple of singles, including one produced by Brian Epstein in 1964, but they failed to chart. Frontman Storm, born Alan Caldwell, was known for his gold lame costumes and on-stage charisma. He died in 1972 aged just 34. ""Rory was a performer,"" his sister Iris Caldwell said. ""He wasn't, like The Beatles, a brilliant songwriter. They called him The Golden Boy and Mr Showbusiness. ""Rory was so far ahead of his time. He was doing glam rock then."" Rod Stewart is among the artists thought to have been influenced by Storm's style, she said. Epstein did not give Storm a real shot at the big time because he ""didn't want any major competition"" for The Beatles, Caldwell believes. The tapes include tracks recorded at the Jive Hive club in Crosby, north of Liverpool, and at Storm's house, known as Stormsville, where bands including The Beatles would get together once clubs like The Cavern had shut at night. ""I suppose these tapes have been in an old sealed box ever since [they were recorded],"" Caldwell said. 'Tremendous presence' Author and Radio Merseyside presenter Spencer Leigh said the group were ""crucial to the early years of Merseybeat"". ""Even though the playing is very rough and ready, they have tremendous presence and were probably considerably better than the Beatles were in March 1960,"" he said. Iris Caldwell's son Adam F, a Mobo Award-winning drum and bass DJ, said the recordings allowed a new generation to hear his uncle's style and personality for the first time. ""The quality of the tape left a bit to be desired - it was over half a century ago - but the spirit and rawness suggest a whole scene waiting to happen,"" he said. ""I am so proud that my uncle was, as has been suggested to me often, the father of the Liverpool sound."" Stage diving Storm's on-stage antics included climbing up to the high diving board during one gig at New Brighton swimming pool. ""He had a cloak on and stripped right off to his little gold Speedos,"" Caldwell recalled. ""He dived into the water, came up and carried on singing the song. ""Another time, they had a box on the side of the stage. He made his entrance by jumping from the box onto the stage. He did manage to break a couple of ribs but he still finished the spot and then went off to hospital."" Other than Starr and guitarist Lu Walters, whose whereabouts are unknown, the original members of Rory Storm and the Hurricanes have all passed away.","Recordings by Rory Storm and the Hurricanes, Ringo Starr's first band and one of the most popular groups of the early Merseybeat era, have been unearthed after more than 50 years."
"By Mark SavageBBC music reporter Fox appears in a trailer for the upcoming single, Holiday, which sees Nas arrive in the Wild West just as Santa Claus is thrown out of a saloon. After he picks up Santa's hat, Nas discovers he's been chosen as ""the new Santa"" and must travel to the future. As he sets off on a reindeer, Fox shouts after him: ""Whatever you do Nas, don't go to 2020!"" It is the first time Fox has played his most famous character on screen since an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel's US chat show in 2015. In the video, he even wears his old cowboy outfit from 1990's Back To The Future Part III, where his time-travelling teenager was trapped in an old Western town. The cameo comes a week after the 59-year-old said he may be forced to retire from acting. Speaking to People magazine, Fox said his ""short-term memory is shot"" as a result of Parkinson's, which he was first diagnosed with in 1991. ""I always had a real proficiency for lines and memorisation,"" he told the magazine. ""And I had some extreme situations where the last couple of jobs I did were actually really word-heavy parts. I struggled during both of them."" Admitting that ""acting is getting tougher to do"", he said writing was now his main creative outlet. Speech problems Fox was one of the biggest stars of the 1980s, thanks to his roles in the Back To The Future films, as well as the TV sitcom Family Ties and projects like Teen Wolf and Casualties Of War. He began to notice tremors in his hands while shooting the comedy Doc Hollywood in 1991, and was diagnosed with Parkinson's shortly after. After going public with his diagnosis in 1998, he continued acting, notably starring in Spin City from 1996-2001 and appearing as a recurring guest star on legal dramas Boston Legal and The Good Wife. His struggle with the degenerative disease was documented in his 2002 autobiography, Lucky Man, in which he revealed he had turned to drink after the diagnosis, almost destroying his marriage in the process. He described his symptoms as including ""rigidity, shuffling, tremors, lack of balance [and] diminished small motor control"". In recent years, he has also struggled with his speech, and practices tongue-twisters to improve his diction. Coldplay cameo Lil Nas X, who achieved overnight fame in 2019 with his country-rap crossover Old Town Road, releases his new single on 13 November. It is not yet known whether Fox will have a bigger role in the full video. The star last played McFly as a gift to Chris Martin's son Moses, whose favourite film is Back To The Future. Fox joined Coldplay on stage in New Jersey in 2016, playing Johnny B Goode - recreating one of the original movie's pivotal scenes. An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that Fox had not appeared on screen as Marty McFly since 1990. This has now been corrected. Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

"More viewers were watching the show on ITV2 than were watching BBC One, BBC Two or ITV in the same time slot. The pair originally ""coupled up"" on the first episode eight weeks ago and walked away with the £50,000 prize. Dani Dyer - daughter of actor Danny Dyer - and pen salesman Jack Fincham have remained together ever since, becoming a firm favourite with viewers. So much so, in fact, that the final saw ITV2 reach its biggest ever overnight audience. An average of 2.6 million watched last year's final, which saw Kem Cetinay and Amber Davies triumph. Dani and Jack held off competition from Laura and Paul (who came second), Kaz and Josh (who came third), and Megan and Wes. ""It's been an amazing experience, I feel so lucky and grateful, it's honestly been amazing,"" Dani told presenter Caroline Flack. ""Everything's been a highlight for me... the ups and downs, you take the good with the bad in here."" After Dani and Jack were announced as the winners, Jack was given the choice of keeping the prize money for himself, or sharing it with Dani. He opted for the latter - meaning the couple will share the £50,000. Jack said the moment he realised he was in love with Dani was when the male and female contestants were separated, with the boys being taken off to an alternative villa. ""When I was at Casa Amor I was so down, I was like 'I'm meant to be enjoying this', but I was just having a [rubbish] time,"" Jack said. ""When I was there, I didn't realise how much I'd miss her, and I just thought, you know what, I love her."" Asked what would be their biggest challenge after leaving the villa, Jack joked: ""Living with her."" The pair confirmed they now plan to start house hunting together. Dani and Jack were the bookies' favourite to win. They had one or two hiccups along the way - including the recent lie detector task. But asked whether they now completely trust each other, Jack said: ""One hundred million percent."" The final episode saw the remaining contestants prepare for the Love Island summer ball - which involved a crash course in salsa dancing. The female contestants then went dress shopping ahead of the islanders' final night in the villa. Later that evening, the couples were seen reflecting on their journeys in the villa before making declarations of love. Dani's declaration to Jack: ""Jack, when I first entered the villa eight weeks ago, I never imagined that in a million years I would have met someone as special as you. ""From our first date together on the beach, to our trip in a hot air balloon, we have already made so many special memories, and I can't wait for even more. ""I have had the summer of my life in here and I owe so much of that to you, Jack."" Jack's declaration to Dani: ""You are everything that I've ever wanted in a girl. Getting to know you and fall in love with you has been one of the most wonderful things to ever happen in my life. ""Firstly, you are an absolute sort. You are so caring and selfless, you have such a beautiful smile. ""When I see you happy, it makes me feel a way that I've never felt about someone before."" Earlier in the episode, Wes Nelson, one of the few contestants to have remained in the villa for the duration of the series, said: ""This has been the best summer ever. ""This has been the best experience ever. And I've met the best girl ever. It's just been one bundle of the best."" On Twitter, Jack and Dani's win went down well with most viewers - although many pointed out it was hardly a surprise. Many fans of the series said they would struggle to fill their evenings now the nightly ITV2 show has finished. But not everyone was a fan of this year's series, with some calling into question the structured elements of the show. 'A long, hot summer' When presenter Caroline Flack tweeted ahead of the launch of this year's Love Island that it was going to be a ""long, hot summer"", nobody knew just how true that would turn out to be. The UK has been in the grip of a heatwave during the eight-week series, in a summer that also saw President Trump's UK visit, the Thai cave rescue and World Cup fever. Through it all, there has been Love Island - a series that has been a consistent success for ITV2, breaking the channel's all-time record ratings and frequently attracting more than five million viewers per episode (across all platforms and catch-up services). The series has seen lie detector tests, contestants who had never heard of Brexit and the inevitable debate about body diversity. Contestants we lost along the way included Samira - who exited so she could be with her evicted boyfriend Frankie - and Niall, who left early in the series for ""personal reasons"", later revealing that he has Asperger's Syndrome. The big questions are whether the winning couple will be able to stay in the spotlight - and stay together - and whether audiences will come back for more next year.

"By Neil SmithEntertainment reporter Balding's novella The Girl Who Thought She Was a Dog will be one of 11 books that young readers in the UK and Ireland will be able to claim. ""It's a way to reach children who don't have the access to books we assume they have,"" the TV presenter said. Julian Clary and Bake Off winner Nadiya Hussain are also writing new books. Clary's title, The Bolds' Great Adventure, features characters from his popular series about hyenas pretending to be humans. Nadiya's Bake Me a Story, meanwhile, is described as ""a unique combination of storybook and cookbook... for all the family to enjoy"". McFly's Tom Fletcher, children's author Pamela Butchart and sports journalist Gerard Siggins are among the others writing titles aimed at children from pre-school to teenage years. The list also includes books featuring the Mr Men, the late Michael Bond's much-loved Paddington Bear and Marvel superheroes The Avengers. World Book Day books 2018 The books can be obtained between 26 February to 25 March 2018 in return for £1 tokens that will be handed out in schools and nurseries. World Book Day celebrated its 20th birthday in 2017, when more than 1.2 million £1 tokens were redeemed. Balding told the BBC she felt honoured to be asked to participate, especially as she is ""relatively new to the children's literature world"". The 46-year-old has written two novels to date about a 10-year-old girl who accidentally buys a horse. ""I just wish there'd been something like this when I was a child,"" said Clary, who called the scheme ""a wonderful thing"". World Book Day is customarily marked by children going to school dressed as their favourite fictional characters. Balding said she found it ""incredibly flattering"" when children dressed up as her Charlie Bass character, while accepting ""it can be a headache for parents"". Organisers, though, say they want parents, teachers and children ""to go beyond dressing up"". A new initiative is #ShareAStoryIn10, which will see 10 authors and World Book Day ambassadors invite their followers to write 10-line stories via Twitter chains. Clary, who will read out some of the stories on a Twitter live stream on Friday afternoon, called the notion ""rather progressive and lovely"". ""Everyone can join in,"" he told the BBC.

"The legendary singer was diagnosed with cancer in 2010 and announced last year she was retiring from music. Franklin won 18 Grammys, and had 17 Top Ten US chart hits over a music career spanning seven decades. The star gave her final performance last November at a gala in New York held in aid of the Elton John Aids Foundation. In a statement, her family said: ""In one of the darkest moments of our lives, we are not able to find the appropriate words to express the pain in our heart. ""We have lost the matriarch and rock of our family. The love she had for her children, grandchildren, nieces, nephews and cousins knew no bounds."" The family also confirmed her death was due to advanced pancreatic cancer of the neuroendocrine type. Born in Memphis to a gospel singer/pianist and a celebrated Baptist preacher, Franklin was tutored from an early age by such gospel stars as Mahalia Jackson and Clara Ward. She struggled to find fame in the early years, with record label Columbia unsure how to frame her impressively powerful voice. After moving to Atlantic Records in 1966 she broke through, and released some of her most iconic songs like Respect soon after the switch. By 1968 she was renowned throughout America and Europe as ""Lady Soul"" - a symbol of black pride who appeared on the cover of Time and was given an award by Martin Luther King. Who has paid tribute? Reaction to the death of the soul legend has poured in throughout Thursday - as high-profile figures paid tribute to her musical legacy and commitment to US civil rights. Sir Elton John said he ""adored and worshipped"" the star, and wrote: ""the loss of Aretha Franklin is a blow for everybody who loves real music."" Former Beatle Sir Paul McCartney wrote: ""Let's all take a moment to give thanks for the beautiful life of Aretha Franklin, the Queen of our souls, who inspired us all for many many years."" Mariah Carey paid tribute to the Queen of Soul on Twitter, calling her an inspiration, mentor and friend. A number of other stars including John Legend, Britney Spears and Tony Bennett shared their memories. In the world of politics, President Trump and his daughter Ivanka tweeted tributes to the soul star. Former President Barack Obama, whose inauguration she performed at, released an emotive statement with his wife Michelle saying Franklin's music ""helped define the American Experience"". Civil Rights campaigners Reverend Jesse Jackson and Reverend Al Sharpton shared touching tributes to their friend of decades. The National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People (NAACP) also released a statement celebrating Aretha Franklin's life and contribution to the US civil rights cause. ""No one can discuss the civil rights movement nor music without paying respect to the Queen of Soul,"" NAACP chairman Leon W. Russell said Aretha Franklin's greatest hits Franklin performed an eye-catching cameo in cult comedy The Blues Brothers, and then she scored a number of big hits in the 1980s including Who's Zooming Who? and the George Michael duet I Knew You Were Waiting (For Me). She was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President George W Bush in 2005, when she was saluted for ""capturing the hearts of millions of Americans"". Ten years later she reduced President Barack Obama to tears when she sang (You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman at a Kennedy Center Honours ceremony, having previously performed at his inauguration. The BBC's Sima Kotecha interviewed Franklin in Detroit in 2007, and shared memories on Thursday of meeting the international star who ""put her at ease straight away"" ""She was warm, honest, generous. Her candid responses were refreshing and spoke volumes about her experience as a big star in the global media spotlight."" 'Nobody like her' Analysis from Mark Savage, BBC music reporter Nobody could inhabit a song like Aretha Franklin. You only have to compare Otis Redding's original recording of Respect to Aretha's version to hear it. His is superb. Hers is otherworldly. Even her most thunderous performances retained their humanity - something her shoutier disciples often overlooked. The desolate colours she painted onto the verses of Carole King's (You Make Me Feel Like A) Natural Woman made the release of the chorus even more joyous. In later years, she was let down by the material she chose (or which was chosen for her) but her performances still had the poetry and power to move audiences - including, notably, Barack Obama - to tears.

"By Steven McIntoshEntertainment reporter Gigs in the pre-smartphone age used to be far less complicated. You'd turn up. Maybe locate the bar and figure out where the bathrooms were. Flick through a programme or chat to your friends, and then just enjoy the show. But these days, such a scene sounds like ancient history. Now, you turn up. Check yourself in on Facebook. Catch up on emails while you're waiting for the show to start, and then when it does, upload some photos and videos you've taken to Instagram. But many concertgoers find the practice irritating, and now some performers are starting to object too. ""No mobile phones, cameras or recording devices will be allowed at Chris Rock's Total Blackout Tour,"" read a message posted on ticketing websites when the comedian's new UK dates went on sale this month. ""Upon arrival, all phones and smart watches will be secured in Yondr pouches that will be unlocked at the end of the show."" The term Yondr might make you Wondr what on earth they're talking about. Yondr is a relatively new American company which gives you a pouch as you're going into a gig for you to place your phone in. The pouch is then locked, and you keep it with you for the duration of the gig. At the end of the show, or if you need to use your phone during the performance, you can take the pouch outside of the phone-free zone to have it unlocked. ""We think smartphones have incredible utility, but not in every setting,"" Yondr say. ""In some situations, they have become a distraction and a crutch - cutting people off from each other and their immediate surroundings."" The company says it aims to ""show people how powerful a moment can be when we aren't focused on documenting or broadcasting it"". Rock's use of Yondr at his upcoming UK dates marks the biggest use of the company's pouches in the UK to date. ""I think Chris Rock's audiences will probably be disgruntled but compliant,"" says Hattie Collins, features editor at ID. ""If you're talking about a Harry Styles gig on the other hand, you're going to have a whole world of problems - there's a much younger audience who are used to sharing everything they do."" Collins adds that the ubiquity of smartphones has arguably had a damaging effect on music fans who want to connect with an artist. ""It's created a passivity as a viewer, so you're much less engaged. You're focused on taking the picture, opening up social media, adding an emoji, and by that point you've missed half the song."" Asked about the Chris Rock shows, a spokesperson for the SSE Hydro in Glasgow told the BBC: ""Although it isn't standard practice, the artist has requested Yondr be used throughout his tour so we were happy to facilitate."" But are the audience happy with the restrictions, and the potential delays at security? Here's what a few ticket buyers told us: Some of the fans said they were sympathetic to how problematic it can be for comedians (as opposed to musicians) to have their performances posted online. If a comedian's jokes are leaked, it can spoil it for other audiences who were planning to see the same show later in the tour. It's arguably less of an issue for musicians, as audiences are already familiar with the material they're performing and reaction will be broadly the same regardless of whether live footage from another show had already been posted online. Collins says: ""I'm very torn, because on one hand I feel like it's something of an infringement of your civil liberties, but I appreciate that sounds far-fetched because they're not taking their phone off you, you keep it on you all the time."" All eyes will be on Rock's shows in January to see how the crowds react in person. His tour will be the biggest UK test yet for Yondr and audiences, who have been asked to turn up an hour early to allow for extra time to go through metal detectors. But Rock isn't the first to use Yondr in the UK - Alicia Keys and Dave Chappelle both utilised it at their London dates last year. Collins thinks the future of phone restrictions at gigs in the UK is hard to predict, as it largely depends on what kind of concert it is. ""I went to see Bob Dylan this month, and they asked that nobody take videos or photos, and there were two or three people wandering up and down the side of the auditorium to make sure nobody did,"" she explains. ""It was quite a refreshing experience, and so much more compelling to watch. Almost quite strange that it was just the stage and not the shadows of 400 mobile phones."" ""But then when I saw TLC two nights later everyone messaged me saying 'ahh these pictures are great', they really enjoyed seeing the photos from a gig they didn't go to themselves."" She adds: ""I think it's a shame because part of me agrees it would be nice to have fewer phones, but on the other hand it's really nice to be able to share.""

"The 23-year-old beat fellow bakers Brendan Lynch and James Morton in Tuesday night's final, after baking a ""Heaven and Hell"" chiffon cake. He said the pressure of completing his law degree while taking part in the competition spurred him on to win. ""If I hadn't been in the middle of the degree, I'm not sure I would have won,"" he said. A peak audience of 7.2 million people watched him take the title, making The Great British Bake Off the most-watched show in its timeslot, with 25% of the total TV audience. Each of the three finalists had to create a puff pastry pie called a pithivier, fondant fancies and chiffon sponges. Wigan-born Whaite, who was recently awarded a first-class honours degree from Manchester University told the BBC that baking ""helps me academically"". ""It gives you time to think and it also takes your mind off [studying] for a while,"" he said. ""It was tough though.

"Alison Hammond was the stand-in weather host on Wednesday's programme, but she accidentally pushed a man dressed as a sailor off the map and into the dock. Hosts Phillip and Holly could barely contain themselves after the mishap. ""It's gonna be a little bit wet in Northern Ireland as you can see,"" Alison joked. Hammond had the job of navigating the weather map with the aid of two male models in sailors' hats, who were topless apart from a pair of braces. They had the task of holding on to the presenter as she jumped across the Irish Sea - but she pushed one of them square in the chest, causing him to lose his balance and fall into the water. Back in the studio, Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby looked stunned at what had just unfolded, with Phillip suggesting: ""Put your cape around him!"" Hammond apologised profusely as he hauled himself back onto the map, and as she duly wrapped him up in her multi-coloured cape. The map was made famous by Fred Talbot, who did the weather between 1988 and 2001 but went on to be jailed for indecently assaulting schoolboys. He wasn't mentioned on the anniversary.

"By Steven McIntoshEntertainment reporter And it's an easy show to throw stones at. On the surface it seems pretty superficial - good looking people, wearing bikinis, lying around in the sun, going on nice dates. But the viewers who have been following the events of the villa for the last eight weeks have a ""much deeper connection"" (as the Islanders might say) to the series. Here's where we're at, first of all. There are four couples left in the villa ahead of Monday night's final. Only three of the remaining eight contestants have been in the villa since day one - Amber, Tommy and Curtis. The favourites to win the £50,000 are Tommy Fury and Molly-Mae Hague. Like last year's winners, Jack and Dani, they are the longest-running and seemingly most secure couple in the villa. It's by no means a done deal, however. Amber is widely regarded as having gone on the biggest journey, and Ovie also has a strong fan following. But it barely even matters which couple wins. The prize money will be a fraction of how much the finalists will be able to earn in the next six months from brand deals, sponsored Instagram posts and nightclub appearances. So what has made Love Island so successful? Perhaps most importantly, it's relatable. The show is a microcosm of society, reflecting a contemporary dating culture which resonates with its young audience in particular. ""The dramas they go through, the conflicts they have to navigate, they're things many of us have to navigate ourselves,"" says Lucy Beresford, psychotherapist and author of Happy Relationships. ""So it appeals from an educational point of view, but there's also a bit of schadenfreude - viewers think 'thank goodness we haven't made that much of a mess of some particular situation!' And it's also a brilliant way of seeing what not to do - the gaslighting that has gone on in the last couple of years, that kind of behaviour has been called out immediately."" But unlike previous series of the show, there's less of a focus now on the more physical elements of a relationship. ""Sorry but why is no-one having sex this year?"" some viewers have asked on Twitter, recalling earlier series where some Islanders were seen having sex despite being surrounded by their fellow contestants. In comparison, the bedroom scenes this year have been much more PG. ""I think that's partly to do with the show trying to evolve to become more mainstream,"" says Rose Hill, senior TV writer at the Daily Mirror. ""They want to go for something more family friendly. ""But also I think the Islanders are much more aware of the implications of having sex on TV. In the 2016 series, Zara Holland lost her Miss Great Britain title and she said it ruined her life. And also with Dani Dyer winning last year, she never had sex with Jack on the show, which proved you don't need to do that in order to win."" Fortunately, there are plenty of other things to keep viewers entertained instead. The producers are skilled in the art of coming up with just the kind of tasks that really get inside the Islanders heads. Tasks like The Snogathon or The Sidebar of Shame are designed to make the contestants second guess themselves, destabilise their relationships, or consider how they're coming across to viewers. Such tasks are part of the reason ITV has considerably improved its aftercare package, to make sure the Islanders have the mental health support they need to process not only what they've been through but also their new-found fame. Regulator Ofcom has proposed new rules to ensure that people who take part in television and radio shows are properly looked after by broadcasters. After leaving the villa this year, Amy Hart said she ""couldn't fault the support"" provided by the team. ""I've got 14 months of therapy guaranteed, but if I need it afterwards I can still have it. [The aftercare] is amazing,"" she told Grazia. The dramas and the tasks have helped this series of Love Island reach a consolidated audience of more than six million. The biggest episode of the series, which showed the fallout from Casa Amour, broke ITV2's all-time ratings record. And that doesn't take into account those who watch short clips from the show online. This year's most viewed video was seen by 1.5 million on YouTube alone. So who is watching Love Island? The viewer breakdown for the 3 July episode (the one that broke the ratings record), provided by audiences monitor BARB, offers some clues. In other words, it reaches demographics other shows can't reach - young, underserved, female audiences. And that's hugely valuable to advertisers. Several issues raised this series have kept those viewers coming back night after night. Beresford praises ""the emotional intelligence of the slightly older men this year, like Ovie"", but also highlights ""the issue of the girl code, and whether it gets warped in any way"". ""Early on this series there was a quite unpleasant trio of Amber, Anna and Amy,"" she says. ""And they really ganged up on people in the villa, men and women. But they used the phrase 'girl code' [to excuse it]. And I think it has highlighted the way in which the girl code does work, but also the way it's often misused. ""There's also been some comment about when Anna challenged Jordan. In effect you had six or seven girls haranguing Jordan, and you could never imagine that happening the other way around. So there has been something less than attractive about the girl code that's been presented in this series."" But Beresford welcomes the fact that such issues prompt conversation among viewers. She also applauds the way some Islanders have coped with rejection. ""There was the conversation Curtis had with Francesca - and I thought Francesca handled that very elegantly,"" she recalls. It's going to be quite a ride for the finalists when they leave the villa on Monday night. Most will go on a whirlwind tour of media interviews before deciding which brand deals they want to sign. But now that the show is increasing to two series a year, most will be watching to see whether there's enough audience appetite for double the dating. ""I'm not sure, because you never want too much of something - even Love Island,"" says Hill. ""If there are two series a year I'm not sure people are going to be quite as invested, they may get bored of it. ""Big Brother introduced two series in the Channel 5 years, and the January one was considered the better one, and in the summer people tuned out a bit, so it'll be interesting to see which Love Island has the better viewing figures.""",The people quickest to criticise Love Island are often those who haven't actually watched it.
"The comedy pair reunited for a Little Britain radio special last October, and a new TV series has been rumoured. They haven't revealed which characters they will play on BBC One's The Big Night In on 23 April. The three-hour show will raise funds and ""celebrate the acts of kindness and ""the spirit of hope"" amid lockdown. It will also see Catherine Tate reprise her role as schoolgirl Lauren - now struggling as she is remotely educated by her teacher, played by David Tennant. Peter Kay and Gary Barlow will also appear from home, and the programme will be hosted by Matt Baker, Zoe Ball, Lenny Henry, Davina McCall and Paddy McGuinness. The Big Night is being organised by Children in Need and Comic Relief, and the money raised will be split between the two charities to provide support during the pandemic. Lucas has also been announced as the host of a new Channel 4 show that will celebrate the ability of ""men, women, children, celebrities and possibly even some pets to entertain themselves during some self-enforced downtime"". Reasons To Be Cheerful With Matt Lucas has been written by Harry Hill. Little Britain on Netflix? Meanwhile, the comedian has been part of a fundraising campaign that has raised £1.1m to provide hot meals for NHS workers. He released a new version of his Baked Potato Song for the #FeedNHS fund. He will also replace Sandi Toksvig as co-host of the next series of The Great British Bake-Off. Walliams, meanwhile, is currently at number one in the UK book chart with his latest children's book, Slime. Little Britain originally ran on TV from 2003 to 2008. The show made one final outing on 2009's Comic Relief; while Walliams revisited the characters of Lou Todd and Emily Howard in later charity specials, without Lucas's involvement. Lucas recently told BBC Radio 2 that the pair would ""love"" to bring Little Britain back to TV ""in some way and at some point"", and confirmed the duo had spoken to Netflix. It was also announced on Thursday that other double acts have reunited virtually while in lockdown for a new podcast series. Audible's Locked Together series was released on Thursday and features duos including French and Saunders; Harry Enfield and Paul Whitehouse; Simon Pegg and Nick Frost; and Rob Delaney and Sharon Horgan.

"He has kept a low profile since sexual assault allegations emerged in 2017. The actor resurfaced to recite the poem The Boxer by Gabriele Tinti in Rome. It includes the lines: ""The more you're wounded the greater you are. And the more empty you are. They used me for their entertainment, fed on shoddy stuff. Life was over in a moment."" The appearance at the Palazzo Massimo alle Terme came less than three weeks after prosecutors in the US dropped a criminal case relating to charges of indecent assault and battery. London's Metropolitan Police are still investigating six allegations of sexual assault in the UK between 1996 and 2013. The double Oscar-winner delivered the nine-minute poem next to a Greek sculpture titled The Boxer at Rest at the Palazzo Massimo, which is part of Italy's National Roman Museum. It's written from the perspective of the boxer, who was immortalised in bronze. It reads: ""I shook the country, made the arenas vibrate, tore my opponents to shreds. I lit up the darkness, collected insults, compelled applause. Not everyone knew how to do this. None of you. ""On the other hand, life is not frightening for those who have never taken a risk. Who can understand me? Who can I speak to? ""The spirit is ill. It can no longer be cured. It will disappear off the face of the earth. This is its fate. I know now I am tired and becoming sad. And this is why you have dug me the grave."" Tinti said it was ""an honour to have Kevin Spacey reading my poems"", adding: ""Rome loves you!""

"Her boyfriend, Aaron Armstrong, wrote on Facebook: ""I will never forget that smile I love you so so much baby your my world forever ever and always."" Gradon, who appeared on the 2016 series of the ITV2 dating show, was crowned Miss Newcastle and Miss Great Britain in 2009. An on-screen tribute was paid before Thursday's episode of the show. Love Island presenter Caroline Flack said the news was ""so very sad"". The makers of the programme, which recently began its latest series, also expressed condolences. In a statement, Northumbria Police said: ""At about 8.27pm yesterday (20 June) police attended a property in Medburn, Ponteland, where sadly a 32-year-old woman was found deceased. ""There are not believed to be any suspicious circumstances surrounding her death. A report will now be prepared for the coroner."" Olivia Buckland, who appeared with Gradon on Love Island, described her as a ""beautiful beautiful woman"" with a ""one in a million"" smile. Alex Bowen, a contestant on the 2016 series, said she was ""a beautiful person with a beautiful soul"", while Kady McDermott, another 2016 participant, said she was ""absolutely heartbroken"". Cara de la Hoyde, who won the 2016 series with Nathan Massey, said her ""heart [was] broken"" as well, while Amber Davies, winner of the 2017 series, said she was ""absolutely in shock"". Other reality TV stars have also paid tribute, with Mario Falcone from The Only Way is Essex saying he was left ""speechless"" by the news. The organisers of the Miss Great Britain contest said they were ""sending all our love"" to Gradon's family. Gradon coupled up with Thomas Powell in the Love Island villa and went on to have a relationship with Katie Salmon. In a lengthy message on Twitter, Salmon said her ""smile will be remembered forever"". Gradon, who had more than 400,000 followers on Instagram, took part in a talk earlier this year about the impact of social media on children.

"By Ian YoungsArts & entertainment reporter In a poem titled The Ex-Ministers, she names no names but writes: ""We are nothing to them now; lemmings going over the white cliffs of Dover."" Swearing In, dedicated to inventive insults about the US president, calls him ""thatch-fraud"" and ""news-maggot"". Duffy's official role ends in 2019. Her new collection is titled Sincerity. At its launch at the Manchester Literature Festival on Thursday, she said the political poems were inspired by the ""evil twins of Brexit and Trump"". 'Buttock-faced smarm' In The Ex-Ministers, she writes about politicians who do lucrative commercial deals around the world after leaving office. Another poem, titled A Formal Complaint, is a rage against a breed of ""gatekeepers"" and ""fake patriots"". It includes the line: ""They do not mean us well, these patriots, with their buttock-faced smarm."" In one poem, Gorilla, she recounts her encounter with a gorilla in a zoo, ending with the line: ""With a day's more evolution, it could even be President."" Swearing In consists of four verses of insults about Mr Trump - including ""twitter-rat"", ""tan-faker"" and ""bigot-merchant"" - and ends with the line: ""Mandrake Mymmerkin, welcome to the White House."" ""Mandrake Mymmerkin"" comes from William Dunbar's 16th Century poem The Flyting of Dunbar and Kennedy. Mandrake means an unpleasant and unwanted root or thing, and a mymmerkin is a small person. 'Constant, dutiful Queen' Duffy has been poet laureate since 2009 and has written about topical events as part of her role, but she has rarely done so in such an overtly political way. In 2016 and 17, she worked with the National Theatre on a show titled My Country, taking stock of Britain after the Brexit vote. Her new collection also includes a poem called Britannia, comparing the 2017 Grenfell Tower fire with the 1966 Aberfan disaster, when a slag heap engulfed a Welsh village, killing 116 children and 28 adults. ""I should not connect the two, but I do,"" she writes. While politicians come in for Duffy's ire, she maintains respect for the Queen. The final line of Britannia reads: ""The constant, dutiful Queen"" - a reference to the fact the monarch's reign has spanned the two tragedies, and she visited both sites soon after each. Sincerity, which will be published on 1 November, also pays homage to figures including Queen Victoria, William Shakespeare and Charlotte Bronte. Much of the collection tackles themes of passing time and ageing, such as the death of parents, childhood memories and children growing up and leaving home.

"Early performances of the show at London's Barbican had been criticised for opening with the speech. Kate Maltby of The Times told the BBC: ""You're bringing out your big showbiz number at the beginning and it's hard to take seriously after that."" But theatregoers say the speech now appears in the third act of the play. Several recent performances of the production are believed to have started with a spotlight on Cumberbatch listening to music on a record player - thought to be Nature Boy by Nat King Cole - instead of the famous words. The run is still in its preview period - when it is common for theatre companies to edit texts and make changes. The play does not officially open until 25 August. Kate Maltby came in for criticism herself earlier this month, when she was one of several journalists to publish their reviews before the official press night. Speaking to Radio 4's Today programme, Maltby agreed it was ""very unfair"" to give ""a final verdict on a production on the very first day"". She added: ""I don't think it's fair to judge things like the energy and the pace... on the first night. ""The real problem with this production, which is not going to change, is that because it's such a star vehicle they've decided to take Hamlet's most famous speech, 'to be or not to be', which is his speech about suicide - 'Is it worth living?', 'Should we all just kill ourselves?' - that's normally in the middle of the play and it's his low point. ""They've taken that speech and made it the opening scene and not repeated it, so we never get it again at its appropriate emotional moment."" The production is directed by Lyndsey Turner, whose previous work includes Posh and Chimerica. It is produced by Sonia Friedman Productions. On Wednesday, the company said it would not comment on the preview process, but would let the play speak for itself on opening night.","Benedict Cumberbatch's production of Hamlet appears to have restored the famous ""to be or not to be"" soliloquy back to its usual place in the play."
"Firth, the star of films like The King's Speech and A Single Man, said he would play the marmalade-loving bear with ""a slight Peruvian flavour"". In the original books by Michael Bond, the bear from darkest Peru was named after the London station where he was found by the Brown family. Hugh Bonneville will star as Mr Brown, with Sally Hawkins playing Mrs Brown and Nicole Kidman playing a villain. Firth will also lend his facial expressions to the computer-animated Paddington, he told the Daily Mail. ""Every other character in the film will be real, live human beings,"" he said. ""But the idea is that Paddington will have something of me in his DNA because I'm going to do some sessions wearing one of those helmets with cameras to capture my face muscles, and all that data will somehow be incorporated into Paddington."" Julie Walters has been cast as housekeeper Mrs Bird and Jim Broadbent has joined the cast as antiques shop owner Mr Gruber. Kidman, who will play an evil taxidermist, told the Mail: ""I just had to do the bear film. ""My agent called and said: 'We've got this offer from London for you to be in a film about a Paddington Bear.' And I said: 'You mean the Paddington Bear?!' ""I was read the stories when I was little and I grew up with Paddington. I know all about his adventures and what mischief he got up to."" The film will be made by Harry Potter producer David Heyman and director Paul King, who was behind the British TV comedies Come Fly With Me and The Mighty Boosh. It is expected to be released around Christmas 2014.",Colin Firth is to provide the voice of Paddington Bear in a new film.
"The film, about a group of gay and lesbian activists who supported striking miners in the 1980s, was released in the UK last year. Pink News found the DVD cover wording had changed, removing a reference to ""gay and lesbian activists"". A lesbian and gay banner was also removed from the back cover. The film's synopsis on the back of the US DVD was also changed from referring to ""a London-based group of gay and lesbian activists"" to ""a group of London-based activists"". The banner which was removed had read ""Lesbians & Gays Support The Miners"". CBS Films, which released the DVD alongside Sony Pictures, told Pink News: ""We're looking into this now and our page for the film remains the same as it has for months."" Ben Roberts, director of the BFI film fund, which backed Pride, said: ""I'm not surprised that the US distributors have taken a decision to sell more copies by watering down the gay content. I'm not defending it, it's wrong and outmoded, but I'm not surprised. ""It's an unfortunate commercial reality both here and in the US that distributors have to deal with and consider in getting films onto the shop shelf. LGBT material is largely marginalised outside of rare hits like Brokeback Mountain."" The DVD was released by the US on 23 December and is scheduled for release in the UK in March. Pride was named best film at the British Independent Film Awards last month. It collected three awards in total, with Andrew Scott and Imelda Staunton picking up the best supporting actor and actress prizes for their roles in the film. Writer Stephen Beresford joked at the awards: ""It took 20 years to convince anyone that a film about vegan lesbian activists was a sure-fire hit."" The critically-acclaimed film received standing ovations at both its world premiere at the Cannes Film Festival in May and at the Toronto International Film Festival in September.",CBS Films has said it will look into why references to homosexuality were removed from the DVD cover of the US release of British film Pride.
"By Ian YoungsEntertainment & arts reporter The event, dubbed the Festival of Brexit when it was announced by then-prime minister Theresa May in 2018, now has the working title Festival UK 2022. Chief creative officer Martin Green is looking for ""big ideas"" that can help heal the divisions surrounding the UK's departure from the EU, and showcase British creativity to the world. He will pick 10 - physical or virtual, happening anywhere and anyhow - to form the festival. They could be staged by people in the worlds of science, technology, engineering, the arts, maths, or a combination. ""This project was conceived to happen after our exit from the EU and acknowledges that we have been going through, and are going through, a divisive time,"" Mr Green tells BBC News. ""Creativity has always proven itself brilliant at finding more of what we have in common than what we don't. So the idea that projects can bring people together is a really timely one."" Asked whether such an event can realistically heal divisions that have come to the fore in recent years as a result of political processes, Mr Green replies: ""I would say that I imagine it has a powerful role to play."" Mr Green was the head of ceremonies at the London 2012 Olympic Games and director of Hull's year as UK City of Culture in 2017. Both went down as resounding successes and were, he says, examples of the unifying power of creativity, be that for a country or a city. He also cites the acclaimed World War One centenary events masterminded by artists like Jeremy Deller and Danny Boyle. None of those projects were overtly political. ""And neither is this,"" Mr Green says. ""Creativity, creative acts and big projects can sit to the side, above and below 'Politics with a big P.'"" He adds: ""Remember, coming together and bringing people together isn't about asking people all to think and believe the same thing. It's about understanding each other and appreciating each other's differences and commonalities."" When she announced the festival two years ago, Mrs May said she wanted it to ""celebrate our nation's diversity and talent, and mark this moment of national renewal with a once-in-a-generation celebration"". Opponents questioned whether it was a moment that merited celebration. Nevertheless, Mr Green believes creativity is ""the best asset we have in finding ways forward and understanding the world we live in"". He is reluctant to narrow down what the Festival UK 2022 might look like. Although it was inspired by the Great Exhibition in 1851 and the Festival of Britain in 1951, it will not be a single event at a single venue. ""A project might last a day or a year,"" Mr Green explains. ""It may be one big act or 10 million tiny acts. ""Obviously we've got significant funding in place so we can be big and bold. The three key words are - we want the projects to be open, original and optimistic. And they can be live, they can be digital, but we expect them probably to be both."" Beyond that, potential participants have a blank slate. ""We've said that we want the project to be a showcase of our creativity, we want projects to be big and popular, and engage millions of people, and work right across the UK."" Greater representation The pitching process is deliberately not restricted to established names. ""By doing it as an open call, we make sure that it's not just the usual suspects,"" Mr Green says. ""We're insisting that new talent is platformed, that there's greater representation in the teams. ""So while we fully expect to be working with some of our greatest institutions and creatives, we're also making sure that it's an opportunity to surface new talent."" They don't have very long to come up with their big ideas, though. The deadline for submissions is just over five weeks away, on 16 October. After that, 30 teams will each be given £100,000 to develop their plans before the final 10 are chosen. The call for submissions comes as the UK and EU enter the crunch period to agree a trade deal before the end of the Brexit transition period on 31 December. In recent months, there have been calls for the festival's £120m budget to be diverted to support arts organisations that are on their knees because of the coronavirus pandemic. Mr Green points out that the government has already pledged £1.57bn in emergency funding, and that the festival will help some such organisations. ""While there is sustainability money needed, there is bailout money needed, there's also a dignity of work issue here,"" he says. ""All creatives want to do is make work. That's why we've made sure we get going very quickly. Within a suite of strategies to support creative industries, this is one part."" Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

"In the original programme, broadcast on Wednesday, Attenborough said: ""Some parts of the continent have become 3.5 Celsius hotter in the past 20 years."" However, the BBC admitted the comment was ""disputable"". A decision was taken on Saturday to remove it from the repeat programme and the iPlayer version. The concluding sixth episode in the BBC's flagship nature series, narrated by the veteran broadcaster, asked what the future holds for the world's wildest continent. To explain the pressures many endangered species face from humans, Attenborough came face-to-face with a baby rhinoceros in Kenya, whose horn had been removed to protect him from poachers. 'Detail is disputable' The presenter then commented on the additional challenges presented by climate change, adding that parts of Africa now face higher temperatures. However, a BBC statement, said: ""There is widespread acknowledgement within the scientific community that the climate of Africa has been changing. ""We accept the detail is disputable and the commentary should have reflected that, therefore the line of commentary has been edited out of Sunday's repeat and iPlayer version removed."" The BBC confirmed that the claim came from a 2006 paper by the Working Group on Climate Change. The footnotes included with the report said that the figure was taken from another report by Christian Aid. It added that the research was carried out by a member of the production team, not Attenborough. The BBC removed the piece of commentary after it was contacted by a journalist from the Guardian newspaper. In 2011, the BBC denied misleading viewers of Attenborough's frozen planet series with footage of newborn polar bear cubs filmed in an animal park, rather than in the wild. Episode five of the series featured the cubs in a den with their mother, with many people assuming they were born and filmed in the Arctic. But the cubs were actually in a Dutch animal park, as was revealed in behind-the-scenes footage on the show's website.","The BBC has re-edited the final episode of David Attenborough's nature series, Africa, on BBC One to remove a piece of commentary about climate change."

"His publicist said McPartlin, who spent time in rehab last year, was taking time off ""for the foreseeable future"" and would have further treatment. ITV's Saturday Night Takeaway will not air this weekend and the final two episodes, scheduled for 31 March and 7 April, won't feature McPartlin. The star was involved in a collision in south-west London on Sunday. His decision to step down comes following talks with his presenting partner Declan Donnelly and with ITV. Orlando finale The final episode of ITV's award-winning Saturday Night Takeaway was due to be broadcast live from Universal Orlando Resort in Florida, with 200 fans of the show flying out in a specially-chartered plane. Star guests have also been lined up for the finale. It follows last year's series final, filmed at Disneyworld in Florida. McPartlin's publicist said in a statement: ""Ant has decided to go back into treatment and step down from his current TV commitments. ""He has spoken with Dec and ITV today and asked for time off for the foreseeable future. As such, Saturday Night Takeaway will not be going ahead this Saturday."" McPartlin was driving his Mini in Mortlake on Sunday afternoon when he was involved in a collision involving two other cars. The 42-year-old was arrested after failing a roadside breathalyser test. A child passenger in one of the cars was taken to hospital for a check-up as a precaution, the Metropolitan Police said. A number of people were treated for minor injuries. McPartlin was taken to a south London police station for questioning before being released under investigation on Monday. 'Reviewing options' An ITV spokesman said: ""ITV has taken a joint decision with Ant and Dec's team not to broadcast Saturday Night Takeaway this weekend. ""We will be reviewing options for the last two episodes of the series (March 31 and April 7) which would not feature Ant who is taking time off to seek treatment. ""We very much hope that he gets the help that he needs."" McPartlin, who co-hosts several ITV shows with Donnelly, including I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out of Here and Britain's Got Talent, confirmed in January he was divorcing Lisa Armstrong, his wife of 11 years. The Bafta-winning star spent two months in rehab last year after admitting to a painkiller and alcohol addiction. He said the addiction stemmed from a painful knee operation in 2015. McPartlin said he was clean from drugs and alcohol in August and returned to presenting duties in November on I'm A Celebrity. He and Donnelly have established themselves as one of Britain's most popular TV double acts over the course of their careers and, for the 17th consecutive year, were voted by viewers as TV's best entertainment presenters at the National Television Awards in January.

"By Helen BushbyEntertainment and arts reporter ""Mental health services are going to be on their knees,"" says the actress and Loose Women star, amid the uncertainty of the coronavirus pandemic. ""We're talking about a possible second wave - it's going to include mental health, and undiagnosed mental illnesses of other kinds."" Psychiatrists warned last month of a ""tsunami"" of mental illness from problems stored up during lockdown. Welch, 62, is no stranger to mental illness, calling it her ""unwelcome visitor"". Her first depressive episode was sparked in 1989 by the birth of her son Matthew (now the frontman of The 1975), and she's spoken out about her debilitating mental health struggles and addictions ever since. She's also said she wished there was more information and medical help available during the early years of her illness. Three marriages, two children and one viral video later, she has written a book documenting the pain she's experienced, and how she and her family have survived. The book was prompted by the massive response she got after she ""very impulsively"" tweeted a video of herself during an episode of clinical depression. ""I was overwhelmed, blindsided by the response, because I've talked out about this for 31 years, so it was actually a shock to me that so many people seem to be desperate to hear what I have to say about my illness,"" she tells BBC News. Welch, whose acting roles include Waterloo Road, Coronation Street and Soldier Soldier, admits she's ""somebody who is very sensitive and tends to take on the worries of the world"". She says of the coronavirus pandemic: ""It's been a very frightening time for everybody, and some people have dealt with that better than others."" She's quick to add that ""obviously, I don't come at this as any kind of medical person"", but having chatted with friends, young people and mental health charities, she's seen people with anxiety fall into two camps during lockdown. ""There were people who went into massive anxiety early on because of lockdown - people were unsure about their jobs, but mostly because of health anxiety,"" she says. ""But I was also talking to a lot of young people, and they found a solace in it, because of a lack of status anxiety in lockdown. ""A lot of young people live their lives in a 'compare and despair' world, and [suddenly] that didn't exist."" ""Other people can't work, or they find it very difficult to, so the fact that many people weren't able to work has given some people a little comfort bubble."" ""With lockdown starting to ease a little bit, we're now dealing with massive strains on the mental health service, because those people are now getting anxiety."" She worries for her many friends in the theatre industry, saying: ""They are not just losing their jobs, they're losing their careers. And I've found that I've got a bit overwhelmed by that."" So, given her own history of anxiety and depression, what advice does she offer to people dealing with similar feelings? Denise Welch's mental health survival tips 1. Allow yourself to be overwhelmed ""What I've found that for my own sanity, is that I've had to take some time in the day to allow myself to become overwhelmed with the worries of the world. It's not just the worries about family, it's the whole globe. "" 2. See what you can do to help others ""I do what I can in little bits, whether that's making a video for somebody or just checking in on somebody, or tweeting. There's a hashtag #ExcludedUK on Twitter and it's about all of those freelancers who haven't got any money. ""So if you have got a job, maybe take a little bit of time each day to see what you can do to help others, even if it's just social media awareness."" 3. Be a bit selfish ""I think that we have to protect our own mental health and be a bit selfish ""I have to look after my family and make sure that they're okay... but if I want to go upstairs and take some time out and have three hours watching The Real Housewives of anywhere in the world, I'm not going to feel guilty about it. ""I think that self care and retreating into your little bubble - it's not to be pooh-poohed. That's basically how I've managed to survive."" Welch has also spoken many times on the panel of ITV's Loose Women about mental health, and discussed her post-natal depression on breakfast TV with Lorraine Kelly. She writes in her book: ""Post-natal depression is the cruellest, most unforgiving and isolating condition, because not only are you submerged in a pitch-black nightmare of mental illness, but you also have a totally dependent child who can't survive without you."" She adds that when she first got ill, ""I would have given anything to see a woman come on the television and talk about having my illness. ""Someone who was well, who had a couple of children and could smile and say, 'I've been where you are right now. But look at me now. Yes, I still have it, but in between I live this great life with my two children. You will get better."" But despite having spoken publicly about her condition in the past, it was still a ""big decision"" to write the book, which spares no details on her life. ""Much as I was frightened about writing it, because I knew it would be triggering, I knew I would have to really invest in order to write a really good book, something I was proud of."" She was also wary of press interest in some of the book's revelations, saying: ""Anything to do with alcohol and drug use always creates a tabloid headline dream for them, you know?"" But she went ahead because: ""I wanted to write the book that I needed throughout my illness. ""And that's what I feel that I've written. If I die tomorrow, I feel that this is my legacy and I'm happy with that. ""I honestly feel that this book is the book that I would have given anything to read when I needed it.""

""I think it's important there's different types of people, so for example, people like Stephen Fry and Ruby Wax have done wonders for the mental health world. ""But my audience tends to be a bit more 'Betty from Bolton', who wouldn't necessarily look to people who they see as being Oxford-educated people, because they feel that they wouldn't relate to them. ""So I am more relatable to a certain group of people, because of the type of TV I do, and I'm a Loose Woman. It's important that there's somebody for everybody."" She adds that a chapter in the book is written by ""my husband, my dad, my sister, my sons and my best friends - because the people who live with those with depression are very under-represented"". ""I always used to say that if the shoe had been on the other foot, and I was living with me, I don't know how tolerant I would have been. And so I'm very, very grateful for the people in my life.""

"By Ian YoungsEntertainment reporter, BBC News The Tardis looms over hundreds of tiny identical booths that are laid out in uniform rows, with each booth containing a figure staring intently at a screen. This is not a scenario from an episode of Doctor Who. This is the scene at the BBC Worldwide Showcase, a TV industry event in Liverpool, where global broadcasting executives come to decide which British programmes to buy for their channels. The Tardis is painted on the wall, the figures are TV buyers from all over the world and they are intently watching hours upon hours of British TV. They also attend special screenings and parties with actors and executives, who try to sprinkle some stardust over proceedings in an attempt to persuade the visitors to buy their shows. Steven Moffat may not be an A-list star, but he is one of the most popular people here. He became executive producer and head writer on Doctor Who in 2010, while Sherlock, the updated detective drama he created with Mark Gatiss, seems to be the main name on the buyers' lips at the Showcase. Moffat says he comes across episodes of Doctor Who ""all the time"" while abroad. ""Doctor Who's everywhere,"" he says. ""You can bump in to the Doctor anywhere."" Despite events like the BBC Worldwide Showcase and the sums of money to be made from selling programmes to foreign channels, Moffat says he does not write shows with overseas sales in mind. ""I don't think creatively it makes any sense at all to try to imagine selling your show to the rest of the world. You'd get it wrong anyway. ""Sherlock and Doctor Who are both doing rather well but they couldn't be more definitively British. They're obtusely British. They're about as British as it gets. You shouldn't be afraid of being British because that's what you're selling."" Before (almost) taking over the world with Sherlock and Doctor Who, Moffat earned his spurs in the TV industry with romantic sitcoms Joking Apart and Coupling. Coupling, which was produced by Moffat's wife Sue Vertue and ran in the UK from 2000-2004, was remade widely, from Kenya to Canada. ""Sue and I would always let the rights to Coupling go for a reasonable fee so long as we got foreign travel out of it, to be quite honest,"" Moffat admits. The most high-profile Coupling remake was in the US, where NBC hoped it would provide a replacement for Friends. It lasted for four episodes. Moffat puts part of the blame for its short lifespan on network interference. ""I didn't like any part of that process,"" he recalls. ""I was fairly against doing it at all because we were still making the British version and that just divides your thoughts. ""It wasn't terrible. I saw a cut of their episode three, which I thought was pretty good. Then it went to the network execs and they asked for some changes and it became terrible. So that may have been typical of the process they went through."" Why do British shows need to be remade for the US anyway? Why did NBC not just air the British original? ""We mostly watch shows made by our own country,"" Moffat replies. ""There are no shows from America that are big hits in Britain. They're all minor hits. Your mates may talk about them but no-one's watching them. They're getting squashed by the locally-made shows. Always."" Despite the buzz around the likes of Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones, he is right. The top 10 shows in the UK in 2013 were all home-made. The situation is ""changing a little bit"", however, Moffat continues. Although Doctor Who is a cult hit rather than a prime-time smash in most countries, it is so distinctive that it has become ""unremakeable"", he says. ""Doctor Who's probably penetrated enough that it's no longer regarded as an import, it's just that show."" US network CBS did make its own Sherlock Holmes series titled Elementary, starring Jonny Lee Miller and Lucy Liu. But it was not an official remake of the British series. That is obviously a source of some contention for Moffat. ""CBS approached us to remake our version,"" he explains. ""We declined, saying we weren't ready to do that. Shortly after that, they announced they were making an updated version of Sherlock Holmes. Those are the bald facts. I can't comment on how it turned out or the people that made it because I've never seen it."" At the time, Moffat was quoted as saying he may have to ""take action"" if Elementary turned out to be too similar to the British version. ""We don't own Sherlock Holmes,"" he now says. ""We don't even own the idea of updating Sherlock Holmes. That's been done before, several times actually. So there's no action to be taken."" Have any foreign TV channels ever enquired about making their own version of Doctor Who? ""If anyone were to ask me, I'd say it's an absolutely insane idea,"" the producer replies. ""You couldn't have more than one Doctor Who in the world. It would just be dreadful.""","Doctor Who and Sherlock are Britain's most successful TV exports, being shown in more than 200 territories worldwide. Steven Moffat, the man in charge of both shows, discusses British TV's global appeal and why a foreign Doctor Who remake would be ""insane""."
"The Hollywood Reporter said the China Film Group has stopped paying a share of takings until a dispute over a new 2% tax on foreign films is resolved. A deal agreed last year between the US and China relaxed some restrictions on foreign film releases in China. It put the share of profits enjoyed by foreign studios at 25%. According to the Motion Picture Association of America, China's box office revenues increased by 36% to $2.7bn (£1.8bn) in 2012, making it the world's second-biggest movie market and underscoring its importance as a key market for Hollywood's moviemakers. 'In breach' The boost came after a World Trade Organisation (WTO) deal reached by US Vice-President Joe Biden and China's then Vice-President Xi Jinping, in which China agreed to increase the number of films allowed to be screened in the country to 34. In return, foreign studios would receive a 25% share of box-office takings, up from between 13% and 17%, as per a previous arrangement. The Hollywood Reporter said the state-run China Film Group subsequently added a 2% value-added tax to each film release. ""Chinese authorities agreed that additional payments, including any taxes, would not come out of the 25% split. But late last fall, the China Film Group informed studios that it intended to pass along the tax after all,"" said the magazine. So far, Hollywood has refused to pay, saying it is in breach of the WTO deal. The ongoing dispute means overseas studios have not received any share in profits from China for some of this year's biggest films. As part of Hollywood's attempt to woo Chinese audiences, Disney released a special version of Iron Man 3, with an extra scene featuring a new character and storyline. The Marvel Comics-based movie in which Robert Downey Jr. continues his success as superhero Tony Stark, earned a record-breaking $65m in China its first weekend.","China has not paid Hollywood its share of the profits from some of this year's big box office films, according to US media reports."
"Oscar-winning director Kevin Macdonald is in charge of the project, which was originally conceived as a film. ""We've decided to turn it into TV, as is the way of the moment,"" Macdonald is quoted as telling the industry journal. Channel 4 would not confirm the project - to be written by Scottish playwright David Harrower - had been commissioned. The Pan Am flight from London to New York exploded 31,000 feet over Lockerbie, 38 minutes after take-off from London on 21 December 1988. The 259 people on board the Boeing 747 were killed, along with 11 people on the ground. Abdelbaset al-Megrahi was jailed for 27 years in 2001 after being found guilty of Britain's worst act of terrorism. The Libyan intelligence officer died of prostate cancer in 2012 after being released on compassionate grounds in 2009. According to the Hollywood Reporter, Macdonald's series will dramatise the bombing and the various conspiracy theories surrounding it. Last year he described the Lockerbie bombing as ""one of those huge events that sort of casts a shadow over Scottish life"".

"By Ian YoungsArts reporter, BBC News The show, which starred Connie Fisher, was the first collaboration between the Halle Orchestra and Lowry and Royal Exchange theatres. It was named best production and also won best design. Other winners included Maxine Peake, who was named best actress for her role in Miss Julie at the Royal Exchange. The awards are billed as the largest of their kind outside London. A new version of Terence Rattigan's The Winslow Boy at the Bolton Octagon claimed two awards - best actor for Christopher Ravenscroft and best supporting actor for Christopher Villiers. The best supporting actress trophy went to Natalie Grady for her role in the Library Theatre's production of DH Lawrence's The Daughter-in-Law. There were two prizes for Black Roses, the Royal Exchange's adaptation of a hard-hitting radio play about 20-year-old Sophie Lancaster, who was murdered in a Lancashire park in 2007 for being a goth. Combining poet Simon Armitage's script with verbatim lines from Lancaster's mother, it was named best studio production, while Coronation Street actress Julie Hesmondhalgh picked up best performance in a studio production. Two Oldham Coliseum shows were honoured - Snookered by taxi driver-turned-writer Ishy Din won best new play, and the special entertainment accolade went to Star Cross'd, an open-air re-telling of Romeo and Juliet with the Montagues and Capulets split by racial as well as family divisions. The Lion King was named best musical, while Opera North's Don Giovanni triumphed in the opera category. There were also two awards for the Royal Shakespeare Company's Julius Caesar - best visiting production and best actor in a visiting production for Ray Fearon.

"By Ian YoungsArts reporter, BBC News Tower Hamlets Council said it would sell Draped Seated Woman after ""unprecedented"" budget cuts. The work has not yet been valued but a Moore sold for £17m earlier this year. The council said the rising threat of metal theft and vandalism made it too expensive to insure if it was on show. The sculpture was bought by the former London County Council for £6,000 in 1960. The bronze sculpture, nicknamed Old Flo, was installed on the Stifford council estate in 1962 but was vandalised and moved to the Yorkshire Sculpture Park in 1997. A council spokesperson said: ""With unprecedented cuts to council budgets, the council finds itself in a difficult situation and being forced to make hard decisions. ""As the borough does not have the funds required to insure or maintain the upkeep of the work, releasing these necessary funds will enable the council to support front-line services."" Tower Hamlets mayor Lutfur Rahman added: ""It is with great regret that I take this decision but we are faced with a stark choice in these times of recession."" The sculpture is expected to be auctioned by Christie's in February. No valuation has been made but Tower Hamlets said estimates had ranged from £4m-£17m. The council is having to make cuts of £100m per year over the next three years. Richard Calvocoressi, director of the Henry Moore Foundation, said he sympathised with the council's position but added that it would be ""very sad"" if the sculpture was no longer on public display. Metal theft has become a major problem in recent years. In 2005, a large Moore work was taken from the foundation in Hertfordshire, while a sundial by the artist was removed from the same location this July. Last December, a bronze work by Barbara Hepworth was stolen from Dulwich Park in south London. Tower Hamlets Council had considered moving Draped Seated Woman to private land in Canary Wharf but has instead chosen to ""explore options"" for a sale. The auction of council artworks to meet budget shortfalls is normally frowned upon in the art world. The last significant case was in 2006, when Bury Council was expelled from the Museums Association for selling an LS Lowry painting for £1.4m. The Museums Association said it could not act in this instance because Draped Seated Woman was an individual piece of public art and not part of a museum collection.",A major Henry Moore sculpture is to be sold by a London council to pay for front-line services after it was decided that it could not be safely displayed on council land.
"Titled Inferno, it will be the fourth novel in the crime series following Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon. Brown said he was influenced by Italian poet Dante's classic work, Inferno, while researching in Florence. Set in Italy, the book will see Langdon drawn into ""a harrowing world centred on one of history's most enduring and mysterious literary masterpieces"". ""Although I studied Dante's Inferno as a student, it wasn't until recently that I came to appreciate the enduring influence of Dante's work on the modern world,"" Brown said. ""With this new novel, I am excited to take readers on a journey deep into this mysterious realm…a landscape of codes, symbols, and more than a few secret passageways."" The book's title was revealed via posts on social media sites including Twitter and Facebook. Every time fans mentioned the novel, a piece of a mosaic was unlocked which eventually revealed the name. The image appears to show The Basilica of Saint Mary of the Flower - otherwise better known as the Duomo - in Florence. It is not the first time puzzles have featured as part of the marketing campaign for Brown's novels. A number of codes, puzzles and teasers were released to coincide with the launch of his last novel, The Lost Symbol. Brown's Langdon novels have sold millions of copies worldwide. The Da Vinci Code is the best selling novel in the UK, in terms of print sales, and has been translated into 51 languages.

"By Ian YoungsEntertainment reporter, BBC News Our Price, Tower Records, Virgin Megastores, Zavvi, MVC, Music Zone, Andy's, Border's and Woolworths - these are some of the national music-selling firms that have disappeared from high streets over the last 10 years. HMV is the last chain standing - but with some stores closing and profits falling, it is struggling. Meanwhile, 90% of independent record shops have shut in the last 25 years. They have all been fighting ferocious onslaughts on several fronts. The internet has brought cheaper rivals like Amazon, Play and iTunes, not to mention illegal downloading. Supermarkets have also muscled in, while the recession has hit high street spending. The remaining shops are starting to fight back by staging Record Store Day on Saturday, offering exclusive releases and in-store gigs in an attempt to pull in the punters. But at this time of struggle, a new chain is hoping to prove that music shops are not dead. That's Entertainment has branches in 12 towns, from Burton-upon-Trent in Staffordshire to North Shields in North Tyneside, and is hoping to double in size by opening another dozen shops this year. Like HMV, it sells CDs, DVDs and games. But unlike the other chains, most of its albums are second-hand. Founder Steve Oliver prefers the term ""replay"", insisting that the thorough refurbishment process - cases are replaced, discs are repaired and polished - makes them nearly new. Crucially, they are much cheaper than the brand new versions, at between 99p and £3.99, and Mr Oliver believes people are more worried about price than whether an album is in a cellophane wrapper. ""People are watching the pounds,"" he says. ""The value stores such as Poundland provide great value offers that are still succeeding on the high street. And we're bringing entertainment very much into that category."" Although his shops do sell some spanking new albums, the ""replay"" sales are more profitable, he says. Most come from sister company Music Magpie, which buys fans' unwanted albums, films and games. For example, Music Magpie will pay you 30p for a copy of Madonna's American Life or Take That's The Circus, which are then sold through That's Entertainment for £1.99. Mr Oliver, who previously ran the Music Zone chain, believes the price will be the key to the chain's fortunes. ""You and I will still go into a pub on a Friday night and put £1 in a jukebox to listen to a song once,"" he says. ""So our price is a very low decision-making price point. It's almost a can of pop and sweets."" That's Entertainment's bargain basement offer is an example of how much music shopping has changed in recent years. In 2010, there were more than 6,500 shops selling music in the UK - but only 8% of those were specialist shops, with the rest being supermarkets, petrol stations and department stores, which mainly stock chart releases or a few cheap compilations. Independent record shops have taken a particular hit in recent years. There were 2,600 in the mid-1980s, according to Graham Jones, a former record sales rep and author of Last Shop Standing: Whatever Happened to Record Shops? Last year there were 281. But that is a rise of 12 from 2009, the first increase for years. ""The situation in the independent sector is better than it's been for a long time,"" Mr Jones says. ""You reach a point when the only shops open are great record shops. You've got to be good to have survived."" He believes the number of stores will remain steady over the next five years - as long as the Chancellor follows through on a promise to clamp down on online retailers that ship CDs and DVDs from the Channel Islands without charging VAT. ""That has been the silent killer of record shops - that's what has closed record shops over the last five years,"" he says. Entertainment Retailers' Association chairman Paul Quirk, who ran four record shops in Merseyside and Lancashire before moving online, says the best record shops have had to adapt to survive. ""At one time you could just stand behind the counter,"" he says. ""The people that did that have got to morph into something different. ""They're selling tickets, they're putting gigs on, they're putting bands on in store, they're opening coffee shops in store, they're online as well - all the things that you need to do these days to make a living."" HMV, meanwhile, has adapted by selling more DVDs, games, books, gadgets and merchandise as well as music. That has not prevented the company, which also owns the Waterstones book shops, from issuing three profits warnings this year and announcing plans to close 60 stores. ""HMV had a great opportunity to be the best record store in the world, and they moved away from that,"" Mr Jones believes. ""It's more an entertainment centre now, it's not a record shop. ""It just tends to have the classic back catalogue or chart CDs - a lot of the stuff you can get cheaper from the supermarket or online."" 'Increasingly niche' Eighty-five per cent of albums are still sold on CD and most observers accept that HMV's presence on high streets is crucial for the survival of record shopping as we know it. But there does not seem to be a lot of real affection for the old dog - in contrast to the loyalty felt towards the best independent shops. Tim Robinson, a music fan who has set up the Recordshopcity website to promote Greater Manchester's 25 independent record shops, says such stores will continue to cater to a dedicated group of connoisseurs for the foreseeable future. ""If HMV disappeared off the high street, that's the not the end of it,"" he says. ""It would reflect the fact that buying music on a physical format is increasingly a niche activity. But I don't think it will disappear completely.""","Record shops have become an endangered species in the last decade, but a new chain is attempting to buck the downward trend. So can music retailers avoid extinction?"

"The youngest on the shortlist, Marten uses sculpture, screen printing and writing to create her work. The prestigious prize is awarded to a British artist, under the age of 50, considered to have put on the best exhibition of the past year. It is the second prize in a month for Marten, who also won the inaugural Hepworth Prize. The 31-year-old painter and sculptor brings together a range of handmade and recognisable objects from everyday life in her installations. A collection of her work on display at Tate Britain in London as part of the Turner Prize exhibition include works made from cotton buds, marbles, snooker chalk and bicycle chains. Accepting her prize from poet Ben Okri, Marten said she ""wasn't expecting"" to win and that she could not think of ""a more brilliant and exciting shortlist of artists to be part of"". The London-based artist, who is from Macclesfield, faced competition from Anthea Hamilton, Michael Dean and Josephine Pryde for the prize, the aim of which is to ""promote public debate around new developments in contemporary art"". The runners-up each receive £5,000. Marten was nominated for projects including Lunar Nibs at the 56th Venice Biennale and her solo exhibition Eucalyptus Let Us In at Greene Naftali in New York. In November, as she won the Hepworth Prize for sculpture, she announced she intended to share the £30,000 money with her four fellow nominees. She told the BBC she also planned to share the Turner Prize money. Addressing the ceremony, Sir Nicholas Serota, outgoing director of the Tate galleries, said: ""At a time when there are fears that we in the UK may be becoming more insular and more inward-looking as a nation, the Turner Prize reminds us that art opens us to new ideas. ""We need to encourage such openness in a society that faces many challenges."" He stressed arts and humanities need to play a central role in the UK education system and should not be ""pushed to the margin"", adding the arts were ""part of our DNA as a nation"". The prize's jury was chaired by Alex Farquharson, director of Tate Britain, who described Marten as a ""kind of poet"". The jury said her work ""is outstanding for its extraordinary range of materials and form"". ""It doesn't present you with an easy, simple, static view of itself,"" Farquharson added. ""The work is like reading very rich, very enjoyable, very elusive, quite enigmatic poetry - rather than a very clear report on what happened in a newspaper. ""I think the thing is to enjoy it for its visual qualities, its physical qualities, and get lost in the game of meaning and games of composition that it offers up."" Analysis by Will Gompertz, BBC arts editor For someone who says she would prefer her work to do the talking, Helen Marten is spending a lot of time in the limelight. Last month she made national news as the winner of the inaugural Hepworth Prize for sculpture, to which she has now added one of the world's highest profile art accolades, the Turner Prize. At 31 years old, she was the youngest artist on the shortlist - and, also, the most difficult to fathom in terms of her work. Her hybrid sculptures, made out of materials both found and fabricated, form a complex tableau of ideas and associations. They are poetic puzzles that question meaning and assumption, and require an almost archaeological mind-set to solve. She wants to jolt you, provoke you, throw you off balance.

"It was all a bit unexpected. I suppose when you get stuck in a lift, it always is. We were coming down in David Hockney's hotel next to the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam so we could find a quiet spot for an interview. He wanted to have a smoke outside: he usually does. A little crowd packed into the lift: a correspondent from the New York Times, a Dutch artist with a TV cameraman in tow, a few others. Nine of us. It jerked to a halt. There was a suspicious silence. We knew we were stuck. We pressed the alarm a few times. Nothing. Nobody's mobile phone could get a signal. There was a bit of feeble shouting and we shuffled around, wondering if the lift would be tricked into moving again. But it only wobbled. We didn't know whether we were in the basement, between floors, or whether we'd somehow gone up by mistake. Someone suggested pushing on the ceiling, because that's what happened in the movies when people climbed out by scrambling up the metal wires. Somehow, that didn't seem very realistic to us. Eventually there were shouts from outside. Of all people, the editor of The Daily Mail, Geordie Greig, a very old friend of Hockney's, was waiting for us in the lobby... and we realised where we were. Geordie went into super boy scout mode and began to reassure us: the general manager of the hotel had been summoned, with his chief engineer. So had the Amsterdam fire department. By this time, we'd prised the door open three inches and or so and we could see light. Someone started to pass bottles of water through the gap. Then Geordie got someone to find a folding stool that was slipped through so that Hockney - 81, after all - could sit down. I thought the community singing was going to start soon. People were making jokes, but realised that the fun would only last for so long. ""Get a crowbar,"" said Hockney (there was a pithy adjective attached). We'd been there for getting on for half an hour. Then feet on the roof of the lift, the sound of clanking - some heavy tools were on the scene - lights from torches, the glimpse of a fireman's uniform. Much heaving and groaning. The New York Times correspondent said she'd spent her whole life in that city - a place built on elevators - and this had never happened to her before. That wasn't much help. We exchanged stories. I thought of Tony Hancock's sketch, from half a century ago, about what happened when a bunch of strangers got marooned in a lift. This seemed more like a Pinter play. I'm afraid I was worried most about whether after all this we'd get our interview. But the cranking and heaving was helping. Eventually, with a creak and a bang, the door was wrenched back, light poured in, and we climbed out, to cheers from the crowd that had gathered in the lobby. It hadn't been exactly life-threatening; more a bit of weird fun. Afterwards, the firemen crowded round. They wanted a picture with Hockney. It was Amsterdam, after all. A very civilised city.

"The 58-year-old funnyman is to realise a long-held ambition of having a role in ITV's Coronation Street. Reeves - real name Jim Moir - will play a TV presenter called Colin who comes to Weatherfield to film. Vic, known for his partnership with Bob Mortimer, said it was ""a real thrill to be part of a British institution."" ""I've been a life-long fan of Corrie,"" he said in a statement. ""In fact, I think I saw the very first one. I try not to miss any episodes."" Best known for such BBC comedy shows as Shooting Stars and House of Fools, Reeves has made occasional acting appearances in such dramas as Marple and Inspector George Gently. Kieran Roberts, Coronation Street's executive producer, said the show was ""thrilled"" to be welcoming ""such a well-loved entertainer and a brilliant actor"". Reeves' role will see him interact with regular characters Norris Cole and Mary Taylor after they are chosen to make an appearance on Colin's show. He will begin filming a three-month stint in July and will appear on screen from late summer onwards. In 2015 Reeves told the Radio Times it ""would make his life complete"" to have a role on the long-running soap. Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

"The BBC dance show, which aired from 18:30-20:15 GMT, pulled in an average of 9.8m viewers - while X Factor drew an average of 7.8m. It marks Strictly's biggest lead over X Factor in six years, although there was no direct overlap in broadcast times. X Factor, which aired from 20:20-22:05, was also down 2m on the same 2011 show.

"Moss won best actress in a drama series for The Handmaid's Tale on Sunday. But what no-one noticed was the message written on the bottom of her shoes. Stylist Karla Welch posted a photo of one shoe with ""Off"" written on the sole. ""You'll have to guess what the other shoe says."" she wrote. ""Our note to the patriarchy #teamresistance."" That's partly a reference to the dystopian drama for which Moss won her award, in which handmaids are slaves forced to bear children for powerful families. They are given names combining ""Of"" with the first name of their male custodian - so the name of Moss's character is Offred. But most people have assumed the other shoe may have borne a word to send a message to a real-world patriarchy in Hollywood and beyond. Speaking after her win, she said it was important for stories to be led by and made by women. ""It's my bread and butter, it's what I'm most interested in as a woman, shows that are about women,"" she said. Moss also said there's ""still a lot of work to be done"", adding: ""There are still meetings you walk into and you wonder if they say 'no' because it's a show or film led by a woman."" Moss paired the customised Olgana Paris heels with a pale pink Prabal Gurung gown. She also used the awards ceremony to send a more overt message to two women - firstly her mother, whom she credited in her acceptance speech with being ""brave and strong and smart"". Then the actress posted a message to author Margaret Atwood, whose 1985 novel The Handmaid's Tale was adapted for TV. Moss wrote: ""She has provided a voice to so many who could not use their own, she has given us her heart and soul as readers, she has asked us to wake up and not only look around but to act and resist. ""She is a champion, a heroine, a rebel, and a fighter for freedom and equality."" Meanwhile, hot on those heels, it was reported that Moss has signed to star in a film about an underground suburban network of women who provided safe abortions in the 1960s. The actress will play a married Chicago woman who becomes pregnant in Call Jane, based on the true story of a 1960s movement called the Jane Collective, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

After one follower suggested ""Newt Scamander only meant to stay in New York for a few hours"", she replied: ""YES!!!!!!!!!!!! People, we have a winner!"" Newt Scamander was the fictional author of a textbook on magical animals that featured in the Harry Potter novels.

Rowling is currently working on the screenplay for the first film, which is expected to be set in 1920s New York after Scamander was commissioned to travel the world and compile a guide to magical beasts. Rowling later tweeted that the anagram was ""the first sentence of a synopsis of Newt's story"", adding: ""It isn't part of the script, but sets the scene.""

"The actor, who also had a recurring role in the 1990s series Murder, She Wrote, died aged 82, of complications from pneumonia. Rogers became a household name after playing Trapper, despite only staying with the show for the first three of 11 seasons. He continued to act, and was latterly hailed for his talent as an investor. Born in Alabama, Rogers was a Princeton graduate and Navy veteran before finding fame as an actor. His early career saw him appear in numerous TV westerns, as well as small roles in the movies such as Cool Hand Luke and The Glory Guys. But it was his on-screen partnership in Mash with fellow surgeon Hawkeye Pierce, played by Alan Alda, which propelled him into the limelight, as one half of one of TV's most beloved duos. Chat show host Larry King tweeted: ""Saddened about #MASH star Wayne Rogers' passing. A Navy vet, terrific actor, helluva businessman & a great guest! "" The TV series Mash was set in a fictional mobile army hospital during the 1950-53 Korean war. It was based on Robert Altman's 1970 film of the same name, which saw Elliot Gould play Trapper opposite Donald Sutherland's cynical Hawkeye. Rogers had initially intended to audition for the role of Hawkeye, but ultimately opted to play the sunnier Trapper. The mischievous surgeons began the show as equals, but after a couple of seasons Rogers became unhappy as the scripts began to champion Alda's character over his own. He left the show, in 1975, after just three years, following a contractual dispute. Rogers said the producers wanted to impose one that included, among other things, ""an old-fashioned morals clause"". ""It said that, in the eyes of the studio, if you behaved in an immoral fashion, they have the right to suspend you. Well, nobody defined an 'immoral fashion,' as it were - so it was at the whim of whoever ran the studio,"" Rogers said, in a 2012 radio interview. Mash went on to run for a further 8 seasons, until 1983, with Mike Farrell replacing Rogers as Hawkeye's new cohort, Captain BJ Hunnicut. Rogers later said that had he realised Mash would last so long, he might have ""kept my mouth shut and stayed put"". He continued to act for another 30 years, earning a Golden Globe nomination for his role as another surgeon, Dr Charley Michaels, in TV comedy House Calls in 1981. The actor also became known for his financial acumen after considerable success in property investment. He wrote the self-help book Make Your Own Rules and served as a regular panellist on Fox TV's Cashin' In. He was awarded a star on Hollywood's Walk of Fame in 2005.","Mash star Wayne Rogers, who played US army surgeon 'Trapper' John McIntyre in the cult 1970s TV series, has died."
"By Ian YoungsArts reporter ""I'm not that interested in costume drama,"" says James Brining, artistic director of the West Yorkshire Playhouse in Leeds, discussing the theatre's Bronte season. You might think being interested in costume drama would be an essential requirement for putting on a season dedicated to the Bronte sisters, whose stage and screen adaptations are rarely without a full set of bodices and bonnets. But Brining says he wants to ""look at the Brontes from as many different perspectives as possible"" to explore what they and their stories mean today. So, in that spirit, a futuristic stage adaptation of Charlotte's final novel Villette catapults the action from 1853 to circa 2216, with the heroine Lucy Snowe depicted as a clone. Meanwhile, a rock musical about the Brontes, composed by one of the people behind the Olivier Award-winning Showstopper!, is being staged in Leeds as a work in progress. And there is an audio drama, intended to be listened to outside the former family home in Haworth, 20 miles away, about an estate agent who has fled London after an affair to seek solace in Bronte country. The season is being staged to mark the 200th anniversary of Charlotte's birth. One hundred and sixty three years ago, Charlotte published Villette, about a solitary young woman trying to find her place in the world, who gives away little of her intense inner self. 'A story worth telling now' ""It is about a woman who is invisible,"" says writer Linda Marshall Griffiths, who has adapted it for the stage. ""A Victorian, unmarried woman, who is thought to be useless in society, and yet she had this vibrant imagination, a fierce mind and an extraordinary voice. And that seemed to be a story that's worth telling now."" In the new West Yorkshire Playhouse version, Lucy is no longer an unassuming Victorian woman - she is a clone who has survived a viral pandemic. ""We could have done bonnets,"" Marshall Griffiths says. ""But when you're adapting or reimagining something, it's worth thinking about how this book can speak to us. Sometimes if you jump into the future it can speak back to us about who we are now."" On Thursday, the West Yorkshire Playhouse will host a debate about which is Charlotte's greatest work - Villette or her more famous debut novel Jane Eyre. Marshall Griffiths, unsurprisingly, votes Villette. ""I think Jane Eyre is all there in Villette, but there's no part of her heart or guts that aren't in Villette,"" she says. ""Also the extraordinary language - it's really potent, deep, poetic, really brilliant stuff. ""It's a harder read but you've got to stick with it. It's such a deep book and there's so much that it's so rich and surprising. It makes my hair stand up when I read it sometimes. It's electrifying."" 'Coming back into life' Charlotte Bronte wrote Villette in the wake of the deaths of her sisters Emily and Anne and brother Branwell. A sense of loneliness and loss hangs over the central character, but Charlotte was advised against explaining the absence of Lucy Snowe's family because it was thought to have been too autobiographical. But in the stage version, Lucy is given two sisters - also clones, naturally, named Esme and Ash - who were killed by the virus. ""They haunt the whole play, in the way I think Emily and Anne haunt Villette,"" Marshall Griffiths says. ""At the heart of Villette it's about someone moving from being totally and utterly devastated back into life. ""It speaks so much about where we're at now because it speaks about what it means to be an outsider - and that for women and for all those people who are outsiders, the journey back in is possible."" The Bronte musical, titled Wasted, is a very different sort of show - but it too tackles Charlotte's reaction to the deaths of her siblings. Wasted will be set in the 19th Century, will tell the story of the family themselves - and will feature actors in bonnets. But it is far from a traditional period retelling. One song sees Charlotte howling over a grungy guitar: ""Why go on writing words in books when the truth is - everybody dies?"" The music is composed by Carl Miller and Christopher Ash, founding member of improvised musical Showstopper!. ""They had really quite difficult lives and there's a lot of strife and struggle going on in their story,"" Ash says. ""The first song that we wrote was called Everybody Dies for Charlotte because she outlives the other three. All of this pain - that's a place to sing rock from."" The show already has one influential fan - it has won the musical theatre award and a £10,000 grant from the Kevin Spacey Foundation. Although there will be bonnets, the volume of ""passion and energy"" in the Brontes' lives means it will not seem out of place when the sisters open their mouths and rock anthems come out, Ash believes. The show's musical style has an ""experimental edge"" in an attempt to do justice to the sisters' groundbreaking work, he adds. ""There's straight rock but also really extreme grindcore, synth-pop and jazz-rock with interesting time signatures. ""There are some nods to more traditional musical theatre things, but when people come and see it, we really want them to feel like they're at some level at a gig. We really want to mix those worlds."" Fans of gentle costume drama have been warned. Villette is at the West Yorkshire Playhouse until 15 October. Wasted is on from 20-22 October.

The judges said the book ""takes us into the hearts and minds of the Welsh Guards in a way that is both interesting and visceral"".

"By Mark SavageBBC Music reporter Headliners include Kendrick Lamar and Fall Out Boy, alongside the likes of Dua Lipa, rapper J Hus and Wolf Alice. Some ticket-holders complained that the bill strayed too far from the event's rock roots. ""The key thing about any festival is that you don't stand still,"" Melvin Benn said. ""I'm very clear on that."" He told BBC News: ""You can't keep drumming up the same acts and expect people to continue to come and see them. ""Festivals have to be a reflection of what the public are listening to."" A second wave of artists was announced on Friday, featuring a higher volume of guitar bands, including Slaves, The Horrors, The Vaccines and The Kooks, alongside the likes of Kate Nash and hip-hop star Travis Scott. Kings of Leon are the third headliners, while other confirmed acts include Skepta, Wolf Alice and Courteeners. Some said the new line-up additions were an improvement. Benn shrugged off the criticism, saying: ""The ticket sales tell me that we're doing the right thing."" The 62-year-old, who also oversees events like Latitude, Wireless and the V Festival, also addressed the issue of gender balance at UK festivals. The topic has been a cause for concern for the music industry since 2015, when a blogger created an embarrassing mock-up of the Reading and Leeds up poster with all the male performers removed. Only nine female acts remained. On Monday, the PRS Foundation will announce that 45 festivals have pledged to work toward achieving a 50/50 gender balance by 2022 - covering music line-ups, conferences and commissions. Benn, whose festivals have yet to sign up to the initiative, expressed doubts about the plan. ""Is that the right way to go about it - to say it's got to be 50/50? I don't know that it is,"" he said. Instead, he has launched a project called ReBalance, which will provide 36 female artists with one week's studio recording time over the next three years. The aim is to ""create a bigger pool of female acts"" so that festivals have a ""greater choice"" when it comes to booking their line-ups. ""So actually, I do support the principle of it [gender equality]. I've chosen a slightly different way to go about it, but with the same principal aim."" The line-up for Reading and Leeds seems pretty diverse. What was the thinking behind that? Melvin Benn: I don't think I'm very far away from what the essence of Reading and Leeds has always been, which is that it's a rock 'n' roll festival. But I guess my interpretation of rock 'n' roll might extend a little beyond guitar music - and that's the key here. The fact that people are slightly surprised at Kendrick headlining is a bit of a shock to me. Especially after Eminem headlined last year. And Public Enemy were a headliner in the '90s. We've had Cypress Hill, too. It's always been the case that we've had that along with the old rock stars. I think people were a little shocked [about Kendrick] to start with and now they're realising it's an incredible booking. What does his booking say about the future of the festival? For me, it's just a clear demonstration that we are a reflection of what people are listening to. I was looking at, for instance, the Official Streaming Top 50 and the Official UK Radio Play Top 50, and there isn't a single guitar band in any one of those. But actually, a significant amount of those songs have got songwriting skill and attitude at the heart of what they're writing and performing. And that's what rock 'n' roll is - it's songwriting and attitude. One of the other criticisms was that acts like Fall Out Boy and Kings Of Leon could have headlined Reading 10 years ago. Are there any newer acts coming through who could take those slots? It is a poisoned chalice, in a way, but I'd absolutely love to see Wolf Alice come through. And there's no reason they won't - because four or five albums in, I'd have thought Wolf Alice would be at that point. Are they at that point after two albums? Not quite, but they're certainly strong enough to headline the Radio 1 stage. In four or five years' time, they'll be knocking at the door. There were strong rumours that Arctic Monkeys would headline one of the nights. Were they ever in contention? Not really. The Arctic Monkeys have headlined Reading and Leeds twice before so they're an act we're always talking to. Was it ever likely for this year? No, it wasn't. They've got their own plans. You sort of know when someone's around and wanting to play, and it wasn't clear to us that they wanted to play, so we didn't push too hard. Who are you most looking forward to on the line-up? Kings Of Leon are one of my favourite guitar bands. I adore them. And I don't want to feed the frenzy of the nay-sayers but it'd be difficult for me not to talk about Travis Scott. As a live act, this guy's incredible. He's was penultimate at Wireless last year - and there's no point in me pretending anything other, it was one of the most rock 'n' roll sets I've ever seen in my entire life. So Travis is very high on my list. Courteeners at Benicassim last year was one of the most intense sets I've ever seen. They weren't headlining, but it was a headlining show that they put on. From that point on, I was like, these guys have got to be high up at Reading and Leeds. Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

"The movie, which stars Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller, took $34m (£22m) during the three-day period, ahead of the Coen Brothers' True Grit. Gulliver's Travels took $7.2m (£4.6m) over two days in fewer cinemas, landing in a modest seventh spot. US box office takings have slid 45% compared to last Christmas. Over the same period in 2009, record-breaking blockbuster Avatar was in its second week of release and box office hit Sherlock Holmes had just opened. Snowstorms on the US east coast and Christmas Eve falling on Friday - one of the main evenings for movie-going in North America - did not help box office performance, analysts say. Hollywood.com's Paul Dergarabedian added that it is a relatively weak Christmas for blockbusting movie openings, allowing smaller films with Oscar potential to do relatively well. Science fiction sequel Tron: Legacy, which at one point commanded the box office chart, eventually fell to number three with less than half the takings of last week. Little Fockers was able to do well with film fans despite a number of unfavourable reviews. The third film failed to capture a better opening than 2004 sequel Meet The Fockers, but performed more favourably that the comedy's original outing Meet The Parents.","The third film in the Fockers franchise has made its debut at number one in the North America office over the Christmas period, studio estimates show."

Outside of North America Rob Marshall's film took $256.3m (£158.3m) in its first three days on release. Its earnings saw it record the highest-grossing international opening of all time, beating 2009's Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. Paul Dergarabedian, of box office tracker Hollywood.com, said the record ""proves the importance of the global marketplace"". Disney's head of distribution Chuck Viane, meanwhile, said the figures showed audiences loved ""the rebooted attitude"" of the film - the first in the series not to feature Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom. However, the film did fall short of the North American openings of the previous two Pirate outings. Dead Man's Chest took $135.6 million (£84m) in 2006, while At World's End took $114.7m (£71m) a year later. The first film in the franchise, The Curse of the Black Pearl, took a relatively modest $46.6m (£28.8m) in its first weekend in 2003. On Stranger Tides beat raunchy comedy Bridesmaids in the US and Canada, the latter taking $21m (£13m) in its second weekend in cinemas. Thor, last week's number one film, slipped down to three with weekend takings of $15.5m (£9.6m).","The new Pirates of the Caribbean film had the biggest opening weekend of the year in the US and Canada, taking $90.1m (£55.6m), estimates suggest."
"Mueller, 30, plays the central role in Beautiful, which charts the early life and career of King - whose hits include A Natural Woman and It's Too Late. The Hollywood Reporter said the show, at the Stephen Sondheim Theatre, was a ""tremendous showcase"" for her talents. But a lukewarm Associated Press review called the show ""insipid"". ""None of this is the fault of Jessie Mueller, the rising Broadway star who plays King with genuine feeling and a lovely voice,"" it added. ""This paint-by-numbers show would have been a whole lot better if it was just turned into a concert with Mueller singing King hits."" King, along with her then-husband Gerry Goffin, wrote hits for some of the biggest pop artists of the 1960s. Their tracks include Will You Love Me Tomorrow?, The Loco-Motion, Take Good Care of My Baby and I'm into Something Good. King's solo album Tapestry was one of the biggest hits of the 1970s, with such songs as It's Too Late and You've Got a Friend. In its review, Broadway World said Beautiful might have ""greater emotional impact if bookwriter Douglas McGrath focused more on how the songs of her 1971 Grammy-winning album reflected King's experiences and emotions while falling in love, getting married and becoming a mother as a teenager, only to be divorced by her mid-20s."" The shows follows in the footsteps of such hit jukebox musicals as Dreamgirls and The Jersey Boys. The New York Times' Ben Brantley wrote: ""Originality is clearly not this show's strong suit. With one very important exception. ""That's Ms Mueller, a Broadway star in waiting for several years, who here steps confidently into the VIP room of musical headliners."" The opening night show attracted stars including Phil Collins and comedian Jerry Seinfeld. 'Awkward and beatific' USA Today's Elysa Gardner echoed the praise for Mueller, calling her performance ""by turns awkward and beatific"". ""If only those qualities were shared by the show as a whole,"" she continued. ""Instead, as is often the case with such projects, Beautiful seems less concerned with exploring King's story than with using it to string together familiar tunes."" Variety's Marilyn Stasio said ""The early life and career of legendary singer-songwriter Carole King surely deserves more imaginative treatment than the corny chronological storytelling."" But she added: ""All is forgotten, even momentarily forgiven, whenever Jessie Mueller, in the modest person of Carole King, sits down at the piano and pours heart and soul into familiar favourites from the composer's songbook.""","Jessie Mueller, the actress who plays singer-songwriter Carole King in a new Broadway musical, has earned rave reviews for her performance."

"By Ellie DavisBBC News entertainment reporter When Marvel launched the international promotional campaign for Iron Man 3 earlier this month, it did not choose Hollywood or London's Leicester Square, but Beijing's Forbidden City. It was the first time a Hollywood film had ever been celebrated inside the Chinese capital's Imperial Palace. Leading man Robert Downey Jr even did his part to charm the Chinese press by calling out to fans in the local Chinese dialect. ""I'm interested in all things Chinese and I live a very Chinese life in America,"" he told the press conference. It was all part of Hollywood's attempt to woo Chinese audiences and authorities. And little wonder. China recently overtook Japan as the world's second-biggest cinema market, as box office revenues surged 30% to $2.7bn (£1.8bn). Since James Cameron's Avatar took $222m (£145m) in China in 2010, Hollywood has been desperate to crack the Chinese market. Marvel has found a way through some of the red tape by co-producing Iron Man 3 in China with DMG Entertainment, a Beijing-based production company. ""The concept of what people want to see and what the government doesn't want to be seen isn't understood very well,"" says DMG's chief executive officer Dan Mintz. Chinese authorities allow 34 foreign films to be screened in the country each year and often request changes to remove sexually explicit scenes, violence and other topics deemed inappropriate for the home audience. ""Everyone is trying to figure out the loopholes,"" says Mintz. ""The pressure is immense to crack this market and to understand it."" Marvel has even created a special Chinese version of the action film with an extra scene featuring a new character and storyline. The additional eight-minute scene stars Chinese actress and singer Fan Bingbing and A-lister Wang Xueqi. ""It takes a fundamental character from our movie who isn't in it as much and extrapolates out his story,"" says British co-writer Drew Pearce. ""People didn't grow up with Marvel in China,"" says Mintz, who set up his advertising and production company 20 years ago. ""Awareness needed to be built."" Mintz says China has ""crept up"" on Hollywood, explaining: ""Five years ago, it didn't matter if you took it seriously, but that was the time they should have been figuring out their strategy."" Iron Man 3 is far from the only film to take aim at the Chinese market. The next Transformers movie is to be partly made in the country, and James Cameron announced a joint venture with two Chinese firms last year. Iron Man 3's main cast members did not film in China. But Don Cheadle, who plays US Air Force colonel James Rhodes, says he is keen to be a success in Asia. ""If I become a big Chinese star, you can guarantee I'll be shooting a movie in China,"" he says. Cheadle stars alongside Iron Man 3's enigmatic new villain, played by the Oscar-winning British actor Sir Ben Kingsley. Sir Ben's character, The Mandarin, first appeared in Marvel comics in 1964 during the height of the Vietnam War. But Sir Ben's Mandarin is a ""contemporary"" villain for ""present-day audiences"", says executive producer Stephen Broussard. Now the head of terrorist group The Ten Rings, The Mandarin is a stereotyped terrorist who broadcasts threatening video messages across the world. ""I think his ethnicity is chosen to illustrate the man and the mask, rather than making a political statement,"" says Sir Ben. Iron Man 3, which opens in UK cinemas on 25 April, is set to storm box offices in many countries in its first weekend of release. The efforts from Marvel and DMG have paid off as they recently secured a release date in China - 3 May, the same day the film comes out in the US. Mintz is convinced that the Chinese market will continue to grow and says it may one day challenge Hollywood for supremacy in the global movie market. ""There's always been a number two, but this is the first time anyone is challenging for number one,"" he says.",Iron Man 3 arrives in cinemas this week. But can Marvel win the ultimate battle - to break China's growing movie market with a special Chinese version of the film?

"By Mark SavageBBC Music reporter Titled Sign Of The Times, the majestic ballad is his first material since One Direction declared a hiatus in January 2016. Here's everything we know about the song... It's about the end of... something What's it about? To be honest, we're not sure. The lyrics are a bit of a riddle. ""Just stop your crying, it's a sign of the times,"" sings Harry as the song opens. ""Welcome to the final show, hope you're wearing your best clothes."" It's about the end of something, then. But what? A relationship? A boyband? An episode of Sherlock? Harry's not telling. But he offers some hope towards the end: ""We could meet again somewhere, somewhere far away from here."" It sounds a bit like David Bowie Honestly, we're not making this up. Although it begins with a series of sombre piano chords (Harry's been practising in private for years), the chorus soars like a miniature Life On Mars, replete with slide guitar riffs and impassioned vocals. It threatens to collapse under the weight of its ambition towards the end, though, piling on more bells and whistles than a clown convention. Seriously, was that choir necessary? It's not the Prince song It might share the same name as Prince's three-decade-old classic, but that's where the similarity ends. Although Harry received a bit of flak from Prince fans, Sheena Easton, who duetted with the star on U Got the Look, says the Purple maestro would have approved. ""I'm sure he doesn't mind,"" the Scottish-born singer told the BBC. ""Prince was such a giving, loving person, I'm sure he's up there saying 'go for it'."" Prince might not be so happy that the final 30 seconds are a carbon copy of Purple Rain, though. He's feeling a bit nervous about the whole thing He told Radio 1's Nick Grimshaw: ""It's a bit weird. I feel like I've been hibernating for so long... and now it's time to give birth ""It's the song I'm most proud of writing."" You can hear it now Shortly after the song premiered on Nick Grimshaw's Radio 1 show at 08:00 BST, Harry helpfully uploaded it to Spotify, Apple and YouTube... All five minutes and 40 seconds of it. That makes it a full 70 seconds longer than anything One Direction ever recorded. It links Harry Styles to Kanye West Harry's co-conspirator on this track is Jeff Bhasker. You might not have heard of him but, since connecting with Kanye West on 2008's moody 808s and Heartbreaks album, he's become one of the industry's most in-demand writers and producers. He co-wrote Uptown Funk with Mark Ronson and Bruno Mars, and his other credits include Jay-Z's Run This Town, Fun's We Are Young and Lana Del Rey's National Anthem - itself a clear influence on Sign Of The Times. Speaking to GQ in 2013, Jeff explained his theory of pop: ""You have to have substance. The best art and music comes from a combination of vulnerability and confidence, where you're opening yourself up. The artists know who they are, and when they deliver that song, people believe them."" He's the only person who can dethrone Ed Sheeran in the charts Ed Sheeran is on course to score his 13th week at number one with Shape Of You later today - but he should savour his last taste of the top, because Harry is almost undoubtedly going to unseat him next week. Bookmakers have given Harry odds of 1/1 of scoring the number one next week - and 10/1 for having the best-selling single of the year. He risked his life for the video Harry was seen dangling from a helicopter off the coast of Skye as he filmed the video earlier this week. It seems likely the clip will continue the watery theme of the single's artwork, which sees Harry wading through the sea towards a ghostly, submerged figure (Please, please let it be Leonardo Di Caprio). The video was directed by French film-maker and musician Yoann Lemoine, who previously made promos for Katy Perry's Teenage Dream and Drake's Take Care. Harry's been working on this material for five years Long before One Direction called it a day (temporarily), Harry was in the studio writing with future collaborators. In 2013, we spoke to Snow Patrol frontman Gary Lightbody, who'd recently spent a week in the studio with Harry and U2 producer Jacknife Lee. ""Harry loves Frightened Rabbit, so his music taste is very varied, it's not just pop,"" said Gary. ""We did four tracks together and hopefully some of them will see the light of day, because they're great tracks. He's got a great voice, he's the real deal."" He got the seal of approval from Ed Sheeran ""I played [Ed] a few songs after the album was finished,"" Harry told Radio 1. ""He didn't say that he didn't like any - but he did like one song that isn't on the album. So I did have a bit of a minute of, like, 'hmmm…'"" He will perform the song for the first time next weekend US fans can tune into Saturday Night Live on 15 April to see him in action, while UK fans can catch him on the Graham Norton Show on BBC One on 21 April.

"In an online interview, the Anchorman creator said he had submitted a script during the sitcom's first season. The script, he added, saw Homer Simpson hypnotised into thinking he was 10. After speaking about his submission recently, he said he had received a call from the team behind the show saying it would be animated in 2013. ""I got a call from The Simpsons saying 'We're going to shoot that episode next year',"" Apatow told Conan O'Brien on his Serious Jibber-Jabber internet show. ""Now I can retire,"" the 44-year-old went on to joke, adding that the ""spec"" - short for speculative - script was ""the first thing [he] ever wrote"". Apatow is currently promoting This Is 40, a comedy built around two of the supporting characters from his 2007 success Knocked Up. More than 500 episodes of The Simpsons have been broadcast since the animated comedy began its first season in December 1989.","A script Judd Apatow wrote for The Simpsons 22 years ago is to finally make it to air, the screenwriter, director and producer has revealed."
"By Paul GlynnEntertainment & arts reporter Nearly four years on, the band are hoping to help remember the 72 lives lost that day - including those of photographer Khadija Saye and her mother Mary Mendy, Smith notes - with their new power-pop single, Why Must a Building Burn? He believes, without wanting to come across as ""too preachy"", that music, poetry and art can be used to ""celebrate life"" and to ""ask questions"". ""I think we often overlook the personalities and the human aspect of it and focus on the kind of facts and figures,"" the frontman tells the BBC. ""I really wanted to get into that idea that these people were here and lived a life and believed in things and they may have been left behind - a lot of people in the country feel left behind. ""I feel like songs that include tragic things are about commemorating and showing some sort of humanity and solidarity with that person and saying, 'These things can live on in a song', and can maybe make people angry about it and say, 'Let's keep the pressure on, let's find out exactly what the chain of events were' as well. ""People in power often disguise their actions in order to continue to profit from the situation, whatever that might be, it could be business, it could be politics or whatever,"" he says. At the time, the music world mobilised quickly to help the families of the victims and the hundreds who were left homeless. Artists for Grenfell - which included Stormzy, Robbie Williams and Rita Ora - released a chart-topping charity reworking of Simon & Garfunkel's Bridge Over Troubled Water. Stormzy and Adele later joined Grenfell survivors in calling on the government to remove ""dangerous cladding"" from buildings, ahead of a public inquiry. In Why Must a Building Burn? Smith allows his thoughts and lyrics to wander from Grenfell to an earlier tragic event that had affected the band in a much more direct manner. Their friend and merchandise man, Nick Alexander, was killed while working at the Bataclan concert venue during the 2015 Paris terrorist attacks that killed 130 people in total. The singer was reminded of seeing his face flash up on the news, in a similar manner to those who died in the west London fire, and the gut-wrenching feeling that followed. He sings: ""I saw a picture / Beamed right through me / I was stunned to recognise your smiling face. ""A family photo / One of many / I was stunned to recognise your smiling face. ""I was hoping for a message to tell me you were here."" A year on from the attack, Maximo Park were joined by the likes of Frank Turner, Gaz Coombes and Fran Healy in putting on A Peaceful Noise - a tribute gig, incidentally hosted just a mile or so from Grenfell. It was intended to honour the dead, many of whom were music lovers like Mr Alexander, and to send out a message of defiance. 'I can't believe this has happened' ""I can't say that I knew Nick really well but we all knew him and travelled alongside him and had conversations on the bus after you've had a few drinks at night and you move on to the next place,"" says Smith. ""It's all a bit of a whirlwind on tour."" ""You sort of say, 'I can't believe this has happened'. Somewhere along the line you wish that somebody would tell you that it wasn't true. ""So extending that to the victims of the Grenfell fire, loads of people would have pinned up pictures in the area, hoping that somebody would come up with some information about this person who wasn't coming back in all probability."" Looking for answers, Smith found himself inspired by the work of British poets Jay Bernard and Roger Robinson. In Surge, Bernard wrote about the 1981 New Cross fire which killed 13 black young people, sparking riots (as depicted on screen last year in Sir Steve McQueen's Small Axe series). Robinson wrote ""really eloquently"" too, he says, about Grenfell in his collection, A Portable Paradise. ""He gives you the kind of full horror of it in a kind of poetic sense, and it's still very lyrical, but it's quite straightforward as well,"" says Smith. ""It mentioned those pictures fluttering around in the wind and tied to a lamppost. To me it's kind of putting images out there so it takes away from where it's come from, and people can kind of relate to it. ""But yeah, in this case [his own song], it's from personal experience."" 'Perfect fodder' With Maximo Park, you get the sense that the personal is, and always has been, political. Last year, the alt-rockers joined a campaign to prevent the demolition of a defunct steelworks in Redcar. Why Must a Building Burn? features on their seventh album, Nature Always Wins - the follow-up to 2017's Risk to Exist, which discussed ""migrants and the idea of empathy"". This time around marks the first time that all three - Smith, drummer Tom English and guitarist Duncan Lloyd have made music together as dads. Not dad rock, per se, but hook-laden high-energy indie-pop made by men with young children. Lead single, Baby, Sleep, finds Smith struggling to get his daughter to sleep (expect a follow-up on home schooling next time). ""I was looking at my parenthood experiences and thinking, 'OK, there's loads of really quite intense highs and lows here, and that is perfect fodder for a pop song,"" says the 41-year-old. ""It's not seen as a very cool or hip subject matter, and also pop music is undoubtedly driven by youth in terms of how people market it. It's not necessarily what you might expect in a pop song so I had to find interesting ways of making something about sleep deprivation!"" The pandemic, it turns out, brought another first for the group, as they were all forced to record their own parts in separate locations, with Smith singing up in his attic in Newcastle as he's done for some of his solo work. Their planned trip to Atlanta, Georgia, to see M.I.A. and Gnarls Barkley producer Ben Allen in the flesh had to be taken online. The album's title, Smith admits, is a nod to how easily the best-laid plans of mice and men and indie bands can all change in an instant. ""Watching the news feels so out of control, I do feel quite helpless,"" he says. ""I feel quite humble, in terms of the bigger picture. At the moment nature has humbled the world. ""It just goes to show that we are kind of connected, a lot more than we think."" Nature Always Wins by Maximo Park is out now. Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

"Trinidadian-born British writer Monique Roffey beat four other contenders with her sixth novel to scoop the £30,000 prize. Judges said the book was ""utterly original... and feels like a classic in the making"". A ""delighted"" Roffey said her win was a vote for Caribbean literature. ""A huge thank you to the judges for exposing my book to a wide readership. I'll be pinching myself for weeks to come,"" she added. Based on a Taino legend of a beautiful woman transformed into a mermaid, the story is set in the Caribbean village of St Constance. David, a fisherman, unexpectedly attracts the attention of Aycayia, a mermaid who is drawn to his singing. When she is captured from the sea during an annual fishing competition, he does all he can to save her, with dramatic consequences. Professor Suzannah Lipscomb, chair of judges, said: ""The Mermaid of Black Conch is an extraordinary, beautifully written, captivating, visceral book - full of mythic energy and unforgettable characters, including some tremendously transgressive women."" Analysis from Rebecca Jones, BBC Arts correspondent The Costa Book Awards have a reputation for picking popular reads: books you would recommend to a friend. And I would definitely recommend The Mermaid of Black Conch. At first, the novel might sound a bit odd. Set on a Caribbean island in the 1970s, it is a bittersweet love story between a beautiful young woman cursed to live as a mermaid and a fisherman. Based on a legend passed down by the indigenous people of the Caribbean, the Taino, there are touches of magic and snippets of poetry. The book was also shortlisted for the Goldsmiths Prize last year, which rewards fiction that breaks the mould or extends the possibilities of the novel. But while it is unusual it is also a joy to read, brimming with memorable characters and vivid descriptions. We see the mermaid's ""hair flying like a nest of cables"" while we are told ""sea moss trailed from her shoulders like slithers of beard"" and ""barnacles speckled the swell of her hips."" For me, this was a hugely entertaining and thought-provoking novel and a worthy winner. Caribbean representation Roffey, a senior lecturer in creative writing at Manchester Metropolitan University, secured her publishing deal through Peepal Tree Press, an independent publisher supporting Caribbean writers. She then crowd-funded her publicity campaign with the support of fellow authors. Roffey's entry was also named Costa's Novel of the Year earlier this month, alongside winners from four other categories: The Mermaid of Black Conch is the thirteenth novel to take the overall prize. Days Without End by Sebastian Barry was the last novel to be named Costa Book of the Year in 2016. Tuesday's virtual ceremony also saw London-based writer Tessa Sheridan receive the 2020 Costa Short Story Award. Sheridan won the public vote and £3,500 for her story, The Person Who Serves, Serves Again. The Costa Book Awards, formerly the Whitbread Book Awards, were established in 1971 to encourage, promote and celebrate the best contemporary British writing. It is open to UK and Irish authors.

But the numbers have fallen back since and, in England, the screening rates are at their lowest for two decades, with Public Health England figures for 2017 showing about three million women failing to have a smear test for at least three-and-half-years.

"The presenter, who first rose to prominence as a contestant on The Apprentice in 2007, joined LBC last April. Hopkins is known for her controversial opinions and regularly attracts criticism for her views. She has continued tweeting since LBC's announcement but has not yet referred to her own departure. Hopkins is also a Mail Online columnist and appeared in Celebrity Big Brother in 2015, finishing in second place. Both LBC and Hopkins declined to comment further when contacted by the BBC. Her two-hour programme was broadcast every Sunday morning and saw her review the week's news and take calls from listeners. This week, she caused anger with when she tweeted that there must be a ""final solution"" in dealing with terrorists following the Manchester terror attack. Some followers questioned her use of the phrase ""final solution"" - a term used by the Nazis to refer to the Holocaust - but later Hopkins altered it to ""true solution"", describing the earlier version as a ""mis-type"". But some Twitter users drew the comments to the attention of the Metropolitan Police, claiming they could incite racial or religious hatred. The Metropolitan Police confirmed the matter was being ""reviewed and assessed by specialist officers"". After Hopkins made the comments, another LBC presenter, James O'Brien, described on air the ""shame"" he felt about sharing a platform with her. He called Hopkins ""a monstrous self-publicist"" who ""employs the most vile of thoughts and language in a desperate attempt to stay relevant and get noticed"". Earlier this year, food writer Jack Monroe won £24,000 in damages, plus £107,000 in legal costs, in a libel action against Hopkins after a row over two tweets, which Monroe said caused ""serious harm"" to her reputation. Hopkins was later told she could not appeal against the ruling. In December, she apologised to a Muslim family she accused of being extremists after they were refused entry to the US for a Disneyland trip.

"Chanel's creative director accused Streep of rejecting one of his dresses because she found a different designer who was willing to pay her. He has since said he ""misunderstood"" - but that has not calmed Streep's ire. ""I do not take this lightly, and Mr Lagerfeld's generic 'statement' of regret for this 'controversy' was not an apology,"" she said. She also criticised fashion website WWD, which originally reported his quotes. ""He lied, they printed the lie, and I am still waiting,"" she said in a statement. The dispute began when WWD published an interview in which Lagerfeld said he had started work on a dress for Streep to wear to Sunday's Academy Awards. But he claimed he was then told by one of the actress's representatives: ""Don't continue the dress. We found somebody who will pay us."" Referring to Streep, he said: ""A genius actress, but cheapness also, no?"" The designer later issued a statement admitting he had ""misunderstood that Ms Streep may have chosen another designer due to remuneration"" and said he regretted the controversy. However, Streep, who has her 20th Oscar nomination this year for Florence Foster Jenkins, hit back. She said Lagerfeld ""defamed me, my stylist and the illustrious designer whose dress I chose to wear, in an important industry publication"". Her statement added: ""The story was picked up globally, and continues, globally, to overwhelm my appearance at the Oscars, on the occasion of my record-breaking 20th nomination, and to eclipse this honour in the eyes of the media, my colleagues and the audience.""

Born in 1887, Laurence Stephen Lowry was renowned for his seemingly simple depictions of working-class life. The record price for one of his works was set in 2011 when his 1949 landscape The Football Match sold for £5.6m. Father and Two Sons was previously owned by Monty Bloom, a key patron of Lowry's, before being bought by collector Frank Cohen in the late 1990s.

"Michael Crawford, Lynda Bellingham, Katherine Jenkins, Ruth Jones and Nicholas Parsons are among other showbiz names receiving titles. Keith said of her damehood: ""It's a recognition for not only my 54 years being an actress but also for all the charities with which I'm associated and I think they'll be thrilled."" The 73-year-old actress, famous for playing women with impeccable cut-glass accents, was honoured for services to the arts and to charity. Keith joined the Royal Shakespeare Company in her early 20s and played minor TV roles before becoming a familiar face as snobby Margot Leadbetter in The Good Life and the upper crust Lady Audrey fforbes-Hamilton in To The Manor Born. She said Margot and Audrey would have been ""chuffed"" by the honour. Knighthoods have gone to sculptor Antony Gormley, creator of the Angel of the North; and film and theatre producer Michael Codron. Gormley, 63, who won the Turner Prize in 1994 and was made an OBE in 1997, said he was ""happy"" to accept the honour. He said: ""I think it's a good thing for sculpture and a recognition of the aspect of sculpture that is about a collective vision."" Also made dames were actress Angela Lansbury and Gillian Lynne, whose choreography credits include Cats and The Phantom of The Opera. Lansbury, most famous for her role as Jessica Fletcher in the television series Murder, She Wrote, told the BBC: ""I'm joining a marvellous group of women I greatly admire like Judi Dench and Maggie Smith. ""It's a lovely thing to be given that nod of approval by your own country and I really cherish it."" Lansbury, 88, was born in East London and has enjoyed a long acting career in film, television and theatre. She returns to the West End in 2014 to play Madame Arcati in a new production of Noel Coward's Blithe Spirit. She admitted that when when she received a call from the British consulate about her honour, she thought it was about her work permit to work on the London stage. Gillian Lynne, 87, whose dance career spans seven decades, said she was ""deeply humbled"" by her DBE. ""Passion for my art has been the motivating factor throughout my career, but for Her Majesty the Queen and the Cabinet Office to deem what I have done to be worthy of this accolade is an honour."" Her long-time collaborator Lord Lloyd Webber said: ""I am thrilled that the grand lady of British musical theatre has got the recognition she deserves. Gillie was already a legend when I was at school! Without Gillie my Cats would never have seen the stage."" Composer and conductor Sir Peter Maxwell Davies, who is Master of the Queen's Music, has become a companion of honour. Among those who received CBEs were actor Michael Crawford, who played Frank Spencer in 1970s sitcom Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em; and TV and radio personality Nicholas Parsons, both for charitable work. Parsons, best known for presenting TV quiz Sale Of The Century and for his role as host of Radio 4's Just A Minute, said he was ""flattered and delighted"". He added: ""I think honours are a wonderful thing to receive if you have worked hard and that is recognised. I don't understand these people who are pompous and say they don't want it."" Parsons, 90, received an OBE for services to drama and broadcasting a decade ago. CBEs have also gone to dancer Carlos Acosta, for services to ballet; former Royal Court artistic director Dominic Cooke, for services to drama; Peter Bennett-Jones, for services to the entertainment industry and to charity, particularly through Comic Relief; and The Apprentice's Karren Brady, for services to entrepreneurship and to women in business. Actress and TV presenter Lynda Bellingham said that being appointed an OBE for her charity work was ""a fantastic way to move forward"" following a ""tough year"". The 65-year-old Loose Women panellist, who became familiar to millions for her long-running role in the Oxo TV adverts, announced earlier this year that she had been diagnosed with cancer. ""I am absolutely delighted and proud to receive this OBE,"" she said. ""It has been a long and tough year but this award is just a fantastic way to move forward. I feel honoured and inspired and very grateful."" Welsh singer Katherine Jenkins said she was ""incredibly humbled"" by her OBE for her contribution to music and services to charity. The Neath-born mezzo-soprano has released 10 albums since making her recording debut in 2004, and has twice won the best album prize at the Classic Brits. Jenkins, 33, said: ""To accept such an award after only a decade of service to music and charity, comes as a wonderful surprise. I share this award with the charitable bodies I am so privileged to work with, especially to those brave service men and women who risk so much for us all on a daily basis."" Sandi Toksvig, who presents BBC Radio 4's The News Quiz, said she was ""honoured"" to be recognised with an OBE for her services to broadcasting. ""Broadcasting is a team effort and I would like to pay tribute to all the writers, production and technical staff I've worked with over the years,"" she added. OBEs also went to best-selling author and screenwriter Anthony Horowitz for services to literature; BBC cameraman Darren Conway for services to British broadcast journalism; Geraint Talfan Davies, for services to culture, broadcasting and charity; and Vanessa Whitburn, former editor of BBC Radio 4's The Archers, for services to radio drama. Whitburn retired earlier this year after 22 years at the helm. Chris Corbould, a special effects supervisor who has worked on many James Bond films and won an Oscar for his work on Inception, received an OBE for services to film. The Order of Merit - which is restricted to 24 living individuals - has gone to orchestra conductor Sir Simon Rattle. Previous recipients include Florence Nightingale and Sir Winston Churchill.

"By Mark SavageBBC Music reporter The clip soon caught the attention of Beyonce herself, who shared it on her Facebook page, adding the caption: ""So amazingly talented!!"" After learning they were unsigned, she contacted the sisters at their home in Atlanta, Georgia - taking them under her wing and signing them to her Parkwood Entertainment label. A few years later, they have uprooted from Atlanta to Los Angeles, released an award-nominated debut album, landed roles in TV show Grown-ish (for which they wrote the theme song), and are currently opening for Beyonce and Jay-Z on their On The Road II stadium tour. ""We're having such a blast,"" says Chloe, on the phone from New York. ""Just building our craft and being really happy and making memories."" It's a pretty safe bet, however, that the duo would have succeeded even without Beyonce's endorsement. They wrote and produced their debut album themselves, concocting an ethereal take on R&B infused with trap beats and intricately-woven harmonies. ""Pretty much the whole album we did in our living room,"" says Halle who, at 18, is the younger of the two sisters. ""It's so funny because that's the family area where we watch TV, then our studio's off in a little corner of the room. So whenever we're recording it's like a game where we're like, 'OK everybody, be quiet!' ""Our little brother's bedroom is right next door so he always has to tiptoe by when we're recording!"" They prefer the homemade approach, turning down the A-list collaborators Beyonce could easily have supplied so they could forge their own musical identity. ""Our mum and dad instilled in us that we can do amazing things, we can learn to do whatever we want,"" says Halle. ""So we were like, 'Instead of getting a big-time producer and having to wait four weeks for a meeting, why don't we just try to create it ourselves?'"" The creative freedom enabled them to cultivate a unique style that blends Halle's languid, jazz-inflected vocals with Chloe's darkly twisted R&B grooves. ""It's super-cool how such a small person can make such hard beats,"" enthuses Halle. ""Whenever my sister and I create, we feel as if we're vessels of a greater power,"" adds Chloe. ""There's a feeling that overcomes us... We'll just hear these sounds and melodies in our heads and we just lay 'em out and see what sticks."" Of course, the idea of two young artists writing and recording on their own shouldn't be remarkable - but in the current pop climate, it's still a rarity. Chloe and Halle's independence stems from their parents Courtney, a recruitment officer, and Doug, a former stockbroker who's now their full-time manager. It was Doug who taught the girls the basics of songwriting when they were 10 and eight years old, and who encourages them to take the lead in business meetings, making their own deals rather than relying on his input. Their confidence is reflected in lyrics that convey the hopes, concerns and self-assuredness of the upcoming generation. ""Do it while you young/Don't let them turn you numb,"" they sing on their album's title track The Kids Are Alright, a manifesto for the youth who want to fix the world. ""A lot of crazy, crazy things are happening right now from a political stance but what I love about our generation is we're learning to come together and we are raising our voices on things we believe in,"" says Chloe. ""We've been to the women's march, we've been on gun control marches,"" adds her sister. ""We find that we need to be there, to be a part of this monumental time in history. We want to say to our children when we're older, 'Yep, we were fighting for this cause. This is something we believed in - and you can fight for what you believe in as well. All you have to do is stand up.'"" ""People say we're too naive but I feel that we're more aware than anybody else,"" says Chloe of her peer group. ""Yes, they may have years of experience on us, but we have heart."" On their new single, Happy Without Me, the duo turn their attention inwards, exploring the peculiar mix of emotions you experience when you see your ex with someone new. ""You thought you were fine - but then you see they're actually doing pretty good without you, and it kind of tugs at your heart,"" says Chloe. Hi Lo, meanwhile, is a ""love letter to ourselves"", says the 20-year-old, which focuses on finding strength in their flaws - from the ""scar up on my thigh"" to a tendency to ""fall in love just way too easy"". Chloe says: ""What we're mentioning in the verses, those are what we used to think of as flaws, and things we didn't necessarily like about ourselves but now we love them. ""There are days when I'm sad and I'll even play that song to myself. ""I think it's important for people of all ages to understand that they're not alone in feeling this way, and it's OK and it's natural - and it's all about how you get back up."" You can hear the impact of Beyonce's musical message in her protégés' songs - continuing her celebration of female power and highlighting the importance of self-worth. ""What I love about Beyonce is she gives us the creative freedom to be what we want to be,"" says Halle. ""We would send songs to her when we felt like they were at a good place and she would give wonderful notes. ""We're just so happy to have her around us. She's just so humble and beautiful and an amazing soul, all in all."" But the sisters' ultimate sounding board is each other. ""We are total opposites but at the same time we work together,"" says Halle. ""I'm definitely a bit more reserved and calm and my sister is very energetic and out there. But we're best friends, so we tell each other all our secrets, we're like each others' diaries."" And that, more than anything, keeps them honest and authentic when they're writing songs. ""Absolutely,"" laughs Chloe. ""Yes, absolutely. We're like, 'Girl, tell the truth!'"" Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

"In the letter, Eliot said he had fallen in love with drama teacher Emily Hale in 1912 but had realised, 35 years later, he did not actually love her. Eliot wrote hundreds of letters to Hale while he was married to his first wife, Vivienne Haigh-Wood. The letters were unsealed this week at Princeton University in New Jersey. Letters in sealed boxes Their unsealing prompted the publication of Eliot's letter, which he had said should only be released when his letters to Hale were made public. The 1,131 letters in the collection have been kept in sealed boxes at Princeton for more than 60 years. Hale donated them in 1956 to the US university's library on condition they were not opened until 50 years after their deaths. Hale died in 1969, four years after Eliot's demise in 1965 at the age of 76. The two had met in Cambridge, Massachusetts, when Eliot attended Harvard. The letters, which date from between 1930 and 1956, are expected to reveal intimate details about their relationship and his creative life. Yet Eliot did not want the letters to be published and ordered the letters he had received from Hale to be destroyed. In a letter released on Thursday by his executors, Eliot said Hale ""would have killed the poet in him"" had they married. ""In retrospect, the nightmare agony of my 17 years with Vivienne seems to me preferable to the dull misery of the mediocre teacher of philosophy which would have been the alternative,"" he wrote. His marriage to Vivienne brought the state of mind, he said, from which came one of his most famous poems, The Waste Land He went on: ""From 1947 on, I realised more and more how little Emily Hale and I had in common,"" accusing her of ""insensitiveness and bad taste"". Eliot's marriages ""I came to see that my love for Emily was the love of a ghost for a ghost, and that the letters I had been writing to her were the letters of an hallucinated man."" Matthew Hollis, Faber's poetry editor, thinks the letter shows Eliot's true feelings about the letters being published. ""I thought it was a letter by a man in pain, who was hurting and clearly felt that his privacy had been invaded and he seems angry at the invasion .. and his reaction is sharp edged and cutting,"" he told BBC arts correspondent Rebecca Jones. The poet and essayist, who was born Thomas Stearns Eliot in 1888, said the pair had never had sexual relations. Eliot is best-known for such poems as The Love Song of J Alfred Prufrock and plays like Murder in the Cathedral. His 1939 collection Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats formed the basis of the musical Cats, recently filmed by director Tom Hooper. Eliot married Vivienne Haigh-Wood in 1915. The union was not a happy one and she died in an asylum in 1947. His second wife, Valerie Eliot, died in 2012, having guarded her husband's literary legacy for more than 40 years.

"By Mark SavageBBC Music reporter From January resellers will need to be certified by Google before they use its AdWords service, which allows people to pay for prominent listings in its search results. The sellers must also disclose that the prices they charge may be higher than the face value. Google said the changes were intended ""to protect customers from scams"". They will target fraudsters who set up temporary websites selling non-existent tickets and who pay for a prominent slot on Google before disappearing with fans' money. But the rules also tighten up restrictions on secondary ticketing websites - who are often listed on Google ahead of official sellers, even when the original event isn't sold out. This has often caused confusion for consumers, with Swiss-based firm Viagogo coming in for particular criticism after posing as an ""official"" outlet in search listings - despite selling second-hand tickets. Google's updated policy says sites like Viagogo, as well as StubHub, Get Me In and Seatwave, must make it clear they are resellers, rather than primary agents. From March 2018, the company will also require certified resellers to post the face value of the tickets along with the reseller's price. In the UK, this is currently a requirement under the Consumer Rights Act - but many companies have struggled, or been unwilling, to comply with the rules. Campaign group FanFair Alliance, which calls for greater regulation of the secondary ticketing market, welcomed Google's clampdown. ""This is a hugely welcome move, with potential to make the ticket-buying process far less complex for consumers,"" it said in a statement. The group said recent research showed ""a significant proportion of would-be ticket buyers use Google to find tickets"", a fact that secondary ticketing sites exploit by paying for higher search rankings. ""At best, such marketing practices could be construed as misleading - with music fans systematically directed towards dedicated ticket touts listing above-face value tickets, even when primary inventory is still available from authorised sellers."" Google's move comes three months after MPs criticised the search engine for promoting touts through its AdWords services. ""This throws up an important issue for Google - they are making money out of this process,"" said Damian Collins, chair of the culture, media and sport committee. ""They must act against ticket touts, it's a clear breach of their guidelines."" Ed Sheeran's tour promoter also criticised Google after adverts pointed fans towards Viagogo, where tickets for the singer's tour were being sold at inflated prices. ""Google needs to bow to pressure and stop taking money for tickets which are sold on the secondary market,"" he told Radio 4 earlier this year.

"Will GompertzArts editor@WillGompertzBBCon Twitter What's more, my seat was uncomfortable and the noise from the nearby kitchen, palpable. Still, one should be thankful for small mercies, at least there wasn't an unfeasibly tall bloke with a large hat sitting in front of me obscuring the view, nor was there any coughing to distract one's attention. This was an opening night, Covid-style. At home, in front of a computer screen, in a tiny study (the kids had command of the TV in the living room) sitting on a wooden chair waiting for the countdown clock in the corner of my monitor to reach 00:00, which it did at 8pm precisely. There was no curtain to go up, just face masks to remove as the actors made their way onto the stage to be welcomed by an eerie silence, four cameras, and an invisible audience of 1400 online punters (along with any friends they'd invited along to watch the show) who had paid £15 a ticket or more, if they chose to add a voluntary donation. The cost to the Almeida of producing and live-streaming the 90-minute play was not cheap, but at least it didn't have a cast of thousands. Or hundreds. Or tens. Just two, in fact: Adrian Lester (Hustle) who plays Gil, and Danny Sapani (Killing Eve) as his soon-to-be new best buddy, Benny. The show opens with Benny upstage, railing against life while being comforted by a bottle of liquor. Gil is at the back sitting behind a piano. He plays the opening chords of Bill Withers' Lean On Me. He stops, comes forward, and delivers a eulogy at his father's funeral. Now it is Benny hanging around at the back. When the unseen mourners disperse the two 50-year-old men are left alone together. They have an awkward conversation in which the self-confident Gil is highly suspicious of the more introspective Benny's claim that they have a recently deceased father in common. ""He's not even cold yet!"", says Gil in response to what he suspects is a rank piece of opportunism by this unknown fella. And so begins Hymn, Lolita Chakrabarti's tale of an unlikely bromance between the gregarious Gil and the circumspect Benny. A classic case of opposites attracting, as each finds in the other an admirable quality they feel they lack in themselves. Gil is optimistic and adventurous. He has ambition. Benny is steady and cautious. He has 10 grand. He's spent years saving it up for a rainy day but Gil has other ideas for it… Chakrabarti (Red Velvet) said she wanted to write a play about a burgeoning love between two men which was not sexual but was deeply emotional. It is a subject that has fascinated her for some time having observed male friends, relatives and her husband (Adrian Lester) over the years. An intimate male relationship under the female gaze (the play is directed by Blanche McIntyre) is not something she recalls having seen on stage before. Hymn is the summation of what she has witnessed: a play in which Gil and Benny discover that together they strike a chord, or, in a story that that rings true from the first note to the last, sing from the same hymn sheet. Lester and Sapani bring a sweaty physicality to their increasingly intense relationship. They are constantly sparring with one another - either physically or verbally: cajoling, ingratiating and dreaming of a better life together. It is a good piece of work in all respects, although it might err on the dramatically predictable for some tastes. But the writing is crisp and witty, while the directing - both on stage and the live-mixing on camera - keeps the story moving along. The regular jumps in time and space are mostly successful, although once or twice the opportunity to flesh out the motivations behind the deepening relationship between Gil and Benny is missed in favour of cracking on to the next scene. Lester and Sapani are outstanding. Only at the very beginning do you get any sense that you are watching a play being filmed in an empty auditorium, not a bespoke piece of content designed for television. In the early exchanges the speech patterns and pauses actors use when on stage - as opposed to a more naturalistic style on telly - feel a little mannered (Lester said ""the quality of silence changes"" in a full auditorium, which, when absent, makes performing ""nerve-wracking""). But you soon adjust, or they do, or both - after which you are immersed in a wonderful theatrical pas de deux that draws you in like a blazing fire on a freezing night. It is a joy to see live theatre back up and running, albeit in compromised circumstances. Rupert Goold, the Almeida's artistic director, deserves a lot of credit for making this excellent show available to the public. It was a bold pivot to go from a play programmed for a theatre audience to a highly convincing on-screen drama in the space of a few weeks. To do it under social distancing rules when the actors can't convey feeling with a hug or high five and rarely get within two metres of each other is an extraordinary achievement by all involved. And then there's the constant threat of Covid coming to spoil the party, which it very nearly did when Chakrabarti and Lester tested positive a few weeks ago. All in all, Hymn is a triumph of creativity over adversity and thoroughly deserves a standing ovation. Hymn at the Almeida Theatre is being streamed live on Saturday and Sunday and a recording of the show will be made available online in due course. Recent reviews by Will Gompertz: Follow Will Gompertz on Twitter","To be honest, the opening night of Hymn - Lolita Chakrabarti's new play at the Almeida Theatre - was the dullest I'd ever attended.

"Debra Cartwright illustrated the cover for Angie Thomas's young adult novel, which was published in February 2017. Hunger Games star Amandla Stenberg was cast in the lead role in the film, which will be released later this year. But some fans were unhappy with her casting as she has a lighter complexion than the character in the book. The Hate U Give tells the story of a 16-year-old girl who is the only witness to the fatal shooting of her unarmed best friend by a police officer. ""I was hoping it would be a very brown-skinned actress, because there's so little opportunities in these big movies for darker-skinned actresses,"" Cartwright told Vulture. She added that when initially deciding what the protagonist would look like for the book cover, she ""literally just followed exactly what they said in the book"". Whilst she believes Stenberg is a ""great actress"" and thinks the film is going to be ""wonderful"", Cartwright thinks the film's adaptation could affect fans of the book. ""To see that the actress is not that description, that would annoy me as a reader, especially if I was a teen. If I saw that, as a teen, it would be very disheartening, a little damaging,"" she added. When news of the film's casting hit Twitter, people weren't too impressed and it sparked a debate about colourism. The book's author, Angie Thomas also hit back at critics, tweeting that she's just glad the book was published in the first place. Last month, Thomas said she always imagined the protagonist as Stenberg. ""Amandla was cast as Starr before there was a cover. When I was writing the book, I imagined Amandla,"" she said. Thomas also said she didn't have control over the cover. ""We have a long way to go in publishing as far as representation matching what the author says sometimes. ""But with me, Amandla is Starr. She embodied that character in so many ways, and I can't see anyone else playing this role,"" she added. Amandla has also spoken out about the controversy in an Instagram post. ""I want those who are worried to know they are seen and heard,"" she wrote. ""The lack of diversity within the black girl representation we're finally getting is apparent and it's NOT ENOUGH."" ""And I understand my role in the quest for onscreen diversity and the sensitivity I must have towards the colourism that I do not experience.""

"The share of attendances for plays last year was 26.2% - up 0.7% from 2009, the Society of London Theatre (SOLT) said. It was already up 4.3% from 2008. The share for musicals was 59.5% - down 1.2% from 2009. It fell 4.4% from 2008 to 2009. Total attendances topped 14m. Figures refuted ""claims that musicals are taking over"", the SOLT said. Plays also achieved a record attendance total of 3,702,031, while the musicals attendance total was down 3% to 8,423,430. In its box office data report, the SOLT states that ""the big driver"" behind business in 2010 was major name actors in plays. They included Knightley and Damian Lewis in The Misanthrope, as well as Sex and the City actress Kim Cattrall and Matthew Macfadyen in Private Lives. Other stars of the screen who trod the West End boards included David Suchet and Zoe Wanamaker, in All My Sons, and Sherlock star Martin Freeman in Clybourne Park. The overall attendances, at 14,152,230 were 0.8% down on 2009's record figure.

"He was well known for playing Willie Tanner, the adoptive father of an alien, in the hit 1980s sitcom ALF. However, Friends fans may remember him better as the pre-Gunther, original sour-faced manager of coffee house Central Perk. Wright played Rachel's boss Terry 'The Jerk' in the first two seasons, while she worked there as a waitress. He famously banned Phoebe from playing live music for customers because her songs were so terrible. ""Rachel, it's not that your friend is bad, it's that she's so bad she makes me want to put my finger through my eye into my brain and swirl it around,"" he said when explaining to Jennifer Aniston's character why Phoebe could no longer play. However, Terry only appeared in the first two seasons of Friends, before Gunther, played by James Michael Taylor, took over as the main character who worked at Central Perk. Wright's biggest hit, Alf, aired from 1986 to 1990, and saw the late Michu Meszaros wearing a full-body suit to portray the titular character. The sitcom followed the friendly alien who crash-landed in the garage of a suburban middle-class family in America. Wright's acting career began in 1974, and he had more than 60 acting credits to his name. He also starred in 26 episodes of Buffalo Bill, and had small roles in Mad About You, Open All Night, Cheers and Murder, She Wrote. However, he has not appeared on screen since 2005. Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane led the tributes to Wright on social media, tweeting: ""RIP Max Wright - a hilarious and talented actor. Sad news to hear of his passing. Who will keep Alf in check now?"" ""I grew up watching [Alf]. Thanks for the laughs, Max Wright,"" tweeted US blogger Perez Hilton. Wright was diagnosed with Lymphoma in 1995, but later went into remission. He died at home in Hermosa Beach, California and is survived by his two children, Ben and Daisy.

"By Tim MastersEntertainment and arts correspondent, BBC News The once-a-decade list often proves controversial, but has a strong track record of elevating relatively unknown novelists into the literary spotlight. Two authors named in 2013 - Zadie Smith and Adam Thirlwell - appeared on the previous Granta Best of Young British Novelists list in 2003. The list was announced at the British Council in London on Monday night. The 2013 Granta list is notable for its multicultural mix, and for being the first to feature a majority of female writers. It features six debut novelists. The names are: Naomi Alderman, Tahmima Anam, Ned Beauman, Jenni Fagan, Adam Foulds, Xiaolu Guo, Sarah Hall, Steven Hall, Joanna Kavenna, Benjamin Markovits, Nadifa Mohamed, Helen Oyeyemi, Ross Raisin, Sunjeev Sahota, Taiye Selasi, Kamila Shamsie, Zadie Smith, David Szalay, Adam Thirlwell and Evie Wyld. ""From satirists to humorists to sweeping epic-spinners, these writers have a command of language and their form which is simply astonishing. They show that the novel has a bold, brilliant future in Britain,"" said Granta editor John Freeman. Beauman, 27, the youngest on the list, was longlisted for the Man Booker Prize last year with his second novel The Teleportation Accident. Several others on the list also have a Man Booker track record. Adam Foulds' The Quickening Maze was shortlisted in 2009, while Sarah Hall's The Electric Michelangelo was shortlisted in 2004 and How to Paint a Dead Man was longlisted in 2009. Zadie Smith's On Beauty was shortlisted in 2005, and went on to win the Orange Prize for Fiction the following year. Jonathan Ruppin, web editor for Foyles, said the Granta list gave a ""fascinating snapshot"" of the state of British literary fiction. ""It's the first time that female writers have formed a majority, which perhaps reflects the fact that women's greater interest in reading fiction has inevitably led to more of them writing it,"" he said. ""A comparison with the first list in 1983 also reflects how multicultural Britain has become in the intervening decades, with writers from a far wider range of ethnic backgrounds making their mark. ""The British publishing industry is often criticised for being parochial, middle-class, white or London-centric and while this may have been true in the past, I think this list shows how much our horizons have broadened."" Some authors on the list illustrate how publishing and technology has changed since the 2003 list. As well as her novels, Naomi Alderman has co-created Zombies, Run! - a fitness game and audio app for smartphones. She was also the lead writer on Bafta-shortlisted alternate reality game Perplex City. The first-time novelists on the 2013 list include Steven Hall, author of The Raw Shark Texts, and also lead writer on recently-released first person shooter video game Crysis 3. Other debut novelists are Jenni Fagan (The Panopticon) Nadifa Mohamed (Black Mamba Boy), Sunjeev Sahota (Ours are the Streets), Taiye Selasi (Ghana Must Go - published last month), and Evie Wyld (After the Fire, A Still Small Voice). Wyld not only writes books but sells them too, running a small independent bookshop called Review, in Peckham, south-east London. She told the BBC: ""Publishing has changed so much in the last couple of decades that you do need a bit of a push with your first book. I certainly wouldn't have got where I am today without other lists and prizes. On the difficulties faced by writers in 2013, she said: ""It's a case of don't give up your day job... I certainly don't do it for the money. Anyone who gets into thinking it's a way to make easy cash is deluded."" Granta's first list of 20 writers aged under 40 was published in 1983. Many of the class of '83 have become household names, such as Martin Amis, William Boyd, Kazuo Ishiguro, Salman Rushdie, Julian Barnes, Pat Barker, Ian McEwan and Rose Tremain. The 1993 list included Iain Banks, Louis de Bernieres, Alan Hollinghurst, Hanif Kureishi, Ben Okri, Will Self and Jeanette Winterson. As well as Zadie Smith and Adam Thirlwell, the Granta list in 2003 included Brick Lane author Monica Ali, Rachel Cusk, AL Kennedy, David Mitchell, and Sarah Waters. Unlike most literary prizes, inclusion on the Granta list is not pegged to a particular book and focuses on existing and emerging talents. The judges for 2013 were Granta editor John Freeman, deputy editor Ellah Allfrey, author Romesh Gunesekera, Stuart Kelly, literary editor of Scotland on Sunday, author and comedian AL Kennedy, Granta publisher Sigrid Rausing and Gaby Wood, head of books at the Telegraph. Kennedy appeared on the Granta Best of Young British Novelist list in 1993 and again in 2003. BBC Radio 4's Book at Bedtime will air readings of five short stories from the Granta authors this week.",A list of Britain's 20 brightest young writers has been unveiled by literary magazine Granta.
"The actor previously played the time-travelling Doctor himself in 2003, in the online animated series Scream of the Shalka. Grant also played an unofficial ""Tenth Doctor"", aka ""The Quite Handsome Doctor"", in a 1996 Comic Relief sketch. The 55-year-old said he was ""honoured"" to be in the Christmas special, which starts filming this week. No details have been released of his role in the show, although it is rumoured he will play the villain. He will be joined by Tom Ward who, until recently, has played Harry Cunningham in BBC One's Silent Witness. The Christmas special is also expected to see the debut of Matt Smith's new companion, played by Jenna-Louise Coleman. Grant, who was born in Swaziland, has starred in films including The Player, Gosford Park and Spiceworld. For Comic Relief's Doctor Who spoof he was cast alongside Rowan Atkinson, Hugh Grant and Jim Broadbent. His incarnation of the Doctor described himself as ""cute, sexy and lick-the-mirror handsome"". The sketch - Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death - was written by Steven Moffat, who now oversees the long-running BBC One series. Last week the BBC issued new artwork for the series ahead of its return to TV screens later this month. The image shows the Doctor, surrounded by Daleks from various eras of the sci-fi show, carrying a seemingly injured Amy Pond, played by Karen Gillan.","Withnail and I star Richard E Grant is to star in the Christmas edition of Doctor Who, the BBC has announced."
"By Mark SavageBBC music reporter Whether it results in the bruised desperation of Sinead O'Connor's Nothing Compares 2U, or the righteous fury of Adele's Rolling In The Deep, nothing lights the spark of creativity faster than the flames of love flickering out. At this point, there aren't many fresh approaches to the topic - but Dolly Parton's Jolene takes a more unusual approach. Instead of shedding tears or vowing revenge, Parton's song is about two women: The mistress who holds the power, and the wife who is begging her to relinquish it. The song's been covered more than 30 times, including a fantastically messy version by The White Stripes, but the storyline has rarely been imitated... until now. Last year, pop singer Raye found herself in the same situation as Parton and the red-headed bank clerk who flirted with her husband in the 1960s. There was just one difference: The Queen of Country got her man back. Raye wasn't so lucky. ""Somebody came along and whisked him away from my grasp,"" she tells the BBC. ""My heart was broken for a hot little second."" Heading into the studio, she tried to capture ""that feeling of panic you have when you know you're losing someone"" in a song. The result is Natalie Don't - a funky, modern successor to Parton's classic. Jolene even gets a namecheck in the bridge, while the music makes subtle nods to I Will Survive and Unbreak My Heart. Despite the subject matter, Raye is buzzing about the single. ""This is the reason I love music - because every negative thing becomes something beautiful,"" she says. ""Making the song I just remember jumping around the studio like a kangaroo on Red Bull. ""It's really light and fluffy. A sad concept over a really funky bassline. I feel I've stumbled on a sound."" That last statement is surprising, because Raye isn't exactly short on hits. The singer, born Rachel Keen in 1997, scored her first top five single in 2016 with You Don't Know Me, and has gone on to work with everyone from Stormzy and David Guetta to Beyoncé. Last year, she won a prestigious songwriting honour at the BMI Awards; and she's currently in the top 10 with the Regard collaboration Secrets. But the 22-year-old has been on a steep learning curve since her first EP came out six years ago. In an early interview, she told BBC 1Xtra that she ""had to evolve and compromise in order to find an audience"" - but that meant straying from the Lauryn Hill and Jill Scott albums that inspired her towards a more club-orientated sound. As a ""young, vulnerable, inexperienced woman"" in the music industry, she says, ""you are guided by everyone around you, maybe unintentionally, to look at everything that is successful and be like it"". ""People are scared behind the scenes to do something different. Because it's a business, risk is negative. And I was swayed left and right trying to keep those people happy. ""I went through a lot of different hairstyles, a lot of different clothes, a lot of different stylists going, 'I don't know what I am. Where do I fit in?' ""My label said I needed to have a look, I needed to have something consistent. And then I found it. It's just me."" You can not only hear the transformation in her music - which now combines her love of dance music with those classic soul influences - but you see it in her appearance. Over the last year, Raye has ditched the hoodies and bleached curls that characterised her early press shots, in favour of vintage dresses and short brown hair that's swept back into Hollywood waves. ""I feel like I'm ready and the music's ready,"" she smiles. ""It's been a long time coming."" The singer's confidence comes from a position of power. After six years, she's written enough hits (for herself and others) to shun bad advice. She's also using her influence to change the dynamic in writing rooms and recording sessions - which, she says, are still predominantly ""male-oriented"". 'He tried to put his hand between my legs' Recently, she's teamed up with a recording engineer called Jenna Felsenthal, who she met while working on Beyoncé's Lion King album, and now accompanies her on every job. ""Jenna's super-talented and we really clicked,"" enthuses the singer. ""So I said, 'Would you be down to engineer for me when you have off days?' And she said, 'I'm down to do it full time'. ""I just love getting women involved, especially in roles where they're not predominant - like the tech side and the engineering side. It's really important to be employing women in these positions as much as possible."" Distressingly, she has first-hand experience of what can happen when young women are abandoned in studios with male collaborators. When she was just 17, Raye was flown to Los Angeles to work with an A-list producer who started acting ""weird"" and ""erratic"". ""I'm thinking; 'What the hell have I walked into?'"" she told the i Newspaper in 2018. ""Next thing I know... he tries to put his hands in between my legs. ""I called my manager and left straight away. Then I cried and cancelled my session the next day. But this happens to girls in studios all the time. All the time."" Those experiences inspired another song, Ice Cream, which - aside from a few live performances - remains unreleased. ""He should have been arrested, goddamn,"" sings Raye over simple piano chords. ""Everything he did left me in a ruin."" ""Every time I perform that song, I cry my eyes out,"" says the singer. ""Not only for me, but for the injustice. Almost every woman I know, every girl I know, has encountered some sort of sexual abuse, ""I've seen people thriving, getting straight As, who go to being unable to turn up to school. It's so messed up."" As with Natalie Don't, Raye used the song to turn an ""ugly and horrible"" situation into a positive. The chorus is defiant and resilient: ""I'm a brave, strong woman - and I'll be damned if I let a man ruin how I walk, how I talk, how I do it"". ""It took me a long time to be able to be strong enough to write that,"" says Raye. ""It's hard to talk about - but if we don't talk about it, then people aren't becoming aware. It's the same thing that's happening with Black Lives Matter."" 'Light skin privilege' Indeed, the singer has been equally vocal about the resurgent civil rights movement in recent weeks, directing scathing messages towards people who utter the phrase ""all lives matter"", and discussing her experiences as a light-skinned woman of Ghanaian-Swiss-English heritage. The issue of ""light skin privilege"" isn't one that receives a lot of attention in the mainstream media - and Raye felt it was important to address how it affected her while growing up in Croydon in South London. ""I used to have really thick, curly black hair at primary school, and I used to feel un-pretty because the boys would fancy the girls with blonde hair and blue eyes,"" she says. ""I actually dyed my hair blonde because of that, which is kind of crazy. ""But then I went to high school and they'd call us 'lighties'. I'd hear boys saying to my friends, 'You're pretty for a black girl,' but because I had lighter skin I would experience a privilege that my black friends did not. ""So it would be easy for me to sit there and be like, 'Black Lives Matter and I'm black,' because I do identify with my black heritage. My grandma raised me, she's black African with a thick accent, speaks Twi around the house, cooks Jollof rice. I really identify with my black culture. ""However, it would be unfair of me to not acknowledge that, although I've had a lot of unfortunate things happen to me because of the colour of my skin, it's nowhere near as bad as what I've seen my black family and my black friends experience."" Prejudice towards lighter skin is still rife in the music industry, she adds. ""There are only a very, very few dark-skinned women in positions of real influence like SZA and Nao and Normani,"" she says. ""So when a black woman is rising, we have to do everything to support them and champion them and give them platforms to be huge."" Such messages of feminism and empowerment have underpinned several of Raye's singles - ""Time is money, so don't mess with mine,"" she sings on You Don't Know Me - but her next EP will be focusing solely on affairs of the heart. ""It is basically a seven-track project about the seven stages of loss,"" she says. ""It's called Her Heart Beats in 4/4 - and I am very excited about it."" The EP opens with Love Again, a prototypical break-up song written about her ex-partner while she was on tour with US R&B star Khalid last year. ""I was literally crying my eyes out once a week going, 'I wish he was here seeing this, I miss him so much!' It was so pathetic."" The EP moves from that initial shock to denial, guilt and bargaining (Natalie Don't appears here), before entering the final stretch of depression, reconstruction and acceptance, on a song called Walk On By. ""I've been heartbroken for two years and I'm finally out the other side and happy and single,"" beams the singer. ""It feels amazing."" Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

"We have taken the judges' scores for all the contestants every week for all 14 series of the programme, largely from the fan-site Ultimate Strictly, and looked at whether you can predict the outcome using statistics. The Strictly team does not give out the results of the public vote, even to us, so we'll have to go on what the judges said and which couples were ejected from the competition each week. This is what we discovered. Has there been points inflation? At first glance it looks as if the number of points the couples get from the judges has been increasing, especially in the first six series. In this chart, we've looked at the average number of points given by the judges in each series. If you've really been concentrating, you'll know that in the 14 series there were a total of four weeks when they had five judges - we've adjusted for that. But if you look further into the numbers, it turns out that there is a more important factor than points inflation. The first series of Strictly ran for eight weeks with eight celebrities - series 14 had 15 couples and 13 weeks of competition. It means that the finalists in the last series had almost twice as many programmes to hone their skills as the ones in the first - so no wonder they were getting 40s by the end, while the average score in the final in 2004 was 28. Who is the toughest judge? It will be no surprise to regular viewers of the show that the toughest judge to please is Craig. On average, he is about a point tougher on contestants than the other judges are. In the first 14 series, Craig Revel Horwood, Bruno Tonioli and Len Goodman served as three of the four judges, with occasional help from guest judges. The fourth spot was taken by Arlene Philips for six series, Alesha Dixon for three and Darcey Bussell for five. But while it is harder to impress Craig, if you get a 10 from him you are almost certain to make it to the last three in the competition. It should be said though that he doesn't give 10s early in the competition. Ali Bastian and Brian Fortuna in episode eight of series seven, and Danny Mac and Oti Mabuse in episode nine of series 14 were his earliest. Does the dance make a difference? There are all sorts of perceptions about easy and difficult dances, with some striking fear into the heart of competitors. Some dances do appear to be harder than others - but the effect is small. Each of the samba, rumba, cha-cha-cha and jive has resulted in scores that were 1.5 points lower on average than for other dances (that is, 1.5 points out of 40), which is probably not enough to send a would-be winner to the dance-off. And in case you were wondering, there is no significant impact from where you appear in the show - going first or last won't affect your chances. Can you predict the winner? Viewers may be pleased to hear that you can't predict the winner or the finalists completely reliably. If you look at the situation half way through the competition, it is possible to make predictions of who the last three couples in the competition will be that were about 70% accurate for the 14 series so far. The most important determinant at that stage is how many points the couples get from the judges that week. Whether they have yet been involved in a dance-off makes surprisingly little difference. There is evidence that the judges tend to give slightly higher scores to female celebrities, but it's not enough to influence who gets to the dance-off or indeed who wins the competition, which has been won eight times by men and six times by women. And it's important to stress that it's still all to play for - if a couple reaches the half-way stage, then there is nothing they can have done so far that means they definitely won't get into the final. But that's not to say there isn't a reliable indicator out there that we haven't tested. Could shoe size be the key indicator? Or the number of rhinestones on the costume? Or what the judges had for breakfast? Strictly-obsessed statisticians - we lay down the gauntlet to you.

Twain's album Now is her first since 2002, and comes after a period where she struggled with debilitating vocal problems. US rock star Tom Petty also returned to the chart this week, after his sudden death on Monday at the age of 66. His 1993 greatest hits album, which features songs like Free Fallin', American Girl and Refugee, re-entered the Top 40 at number 14. Other new entries this week came from pop acts Demi Lovato (number five), Miley Cyrus (eight) and Hurts (21). The long build-up to Christmas also started to exert its influence, with compilations by David Bowie, Michael Jackson and Feeder entering the chart, alongside a live album from Pink Floyd star David Gilmour. Twain's chart battle with Wolf Alice came with a side-helping of celebrity endorsements, with Jeremy Corbyn petitioning his supporters to buy the London indie band's latest record, Visions Of A Life. ""After helping Labour beat the odds in the election, it's great to see @WolfAliceMusic doing the same in the charts,"" he wrote on Twitter, along with a link to their online store. Twain, on the other hand, won the support of former One Direction star (and labelmate at Virgin EMI) Niall Horan. In the singles chart, Sam Smith was knocked off the number one spot by US rapper Post Malone. His song, Rockstar, swapped places with Smith's ballad Too Good At Goodbyes, which dropped to number two. Love Island stars Chris and Kem scored the week's biggest new entry with Little Bit Leave It. Despite hopes it could top the chart earlier this week, its sales tailed off and the duo ended up at number 15. Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

"Cox told TV host Jimmy Kimmel she remembered very little about the hit sitcom in which she played Monica for a decade. ""People love the show so much, I decided to binge watch Friends... it's really good!"" she said via video link. ""I don't remember even being on the show, I have such a bad memory."" She added: ""I remember obviously loving everybody there and having fun and I remember certain times of my life I was there, but I don't remember episodes."" The hugely successful show notched up 236 instalments and has enjoyed a recent resurgence among a new generation on Netflix. Cox was chatting with Kimmel on his YouTube Quarantine Minilogue, which he began after his late-night talk show was taken off air as a result of the pandemic. The actress said she had bought the entire Friends box set on Amazon Prime after it was taken off Netflix in the US in anticipation of the HBO Max streaming service launching in May. All 10 series are still available on Netflix in the UK and episodes also run on Channel 5 and Comedy Central. Due to her foggy recollection, Cox said she gets stressed out when people ask her to answer questions about Friends. That was a red rag to a bull for Kimmel, who decided to test her knowledge in a head-to-head with his cousin, a huge fan of the show. Despite the questions all being Monica-related, Cox lost 5-0. Questions she did not know the answers to included who Monica shared her first kiss with, and who peed on her leg in season four episode The One With The Jellyfish. Reunion delayed Cox used her appearance on Kimmel's stream to ask viewers to make a donation to the Meals On Wheels charity. She also confirmed that filming for the long-awaited Friends reunion special, which was announced in February, has been postponed due to the coronavirus crisis. Cox said she and former co-stars Jennifer Aniston, Lisa Kudrow, Matthew Perry, Matt LeBlanc and David Schwimmer had been supposed to film the programme on Monday and Tuesday. The unscripted special will see the cast reminiscing about their time on the series - if they can remember it. The special is expected to be available on HBO Max, but no firm date has been given.

"By Ben HunteBBC LGBT correspondent In 1993, Channel 4 produced the first TV adaptation of the well-loved stories (Maupin has written 10) which follow a group of San Franciscans over several months in the 1970s. The stories have interwoven plots and interrelated characters, some of whom are LGBT. The original series caused a stir when it eventually aired in the United States on PBS later that year because of its LGBT characters, scenes showing nudity and drug taking. PBS was flooded with calls from the public, both before and after Tales of the City was screened, with many demanding the show be cancelled. And as the argument rumbled on there was a bomb threat in Chattanooga, Tennessee. ""When Tales of the City appeared in America in 1994, it was the first time Americans had seen two men kissing on broadcast television. It caused an uproar with certain right wing groups who petitioned Congress. They shut it down, essentially,"" says Maupin. PBS went on to screen two versions of the show, one as produced and one edited to remove scenes such as two men in bed together. But it didn't stop the protests from groups promoting family values who called it ""gay propaganda"" and ""anti-family, anti-religious"". The debate also went to the Senate in some states. The series was nonetheless a huge ratings hit for PBS, and also won a legion of fans and much critical praise. PBS was spooked though and shied away from making the sequel, leading Maupin to say PBS had ""caved"" in. Netflix's release will be the fourth TV adaptation of Maupin's books. Each series has taken up a different stage in Maupin's series. But this latest venture is its most diverse yet. The actors chosen to play the iconic roles were this time very important to the author, one of the leading names in queer literature. ""I just think that a gay actor can bring something special to the role from their own experience. I've always wanted a gay man to play Michael Tolliver, for instance, he's sort of my alter ego,"" says Maupin. Michael's character is played by Murray Bartlett. Other cast members include Laura Linney, who has played the central character of Mary Ann Singleton in all series, and Olympia Dukakis (also in the show from the start) as Anna Madrigal. Ellen Page, Paul Gross and Josiah Victoria Garcia and Zosia Mamet also feature. There is currently a heated debate within Hollywood about whether non-LGBT actors should be playing LGBT roles, especially when there is so much queer acting talent available to represent themselves. According to industry insiders, several of these performers will be out of work, whilst their straight and cisgendered (meaning they identify with their birth sex)colleagues go to great lengths to perform their potentially perfect queer castings. Maupin believes that many LGBT performers will stay silent about their sexuality, hoping to not get typecast or overlooked. ""We've got many more 'out' actors now, but not enough. There's still huge lies being told across the board, because agents demand that if they're gay actors, there's still an idea in Hollywood that the big stars can't be gay. ""And we do have four or five really big stars who are gay, and they've gone to great lengths to cover it up, getting wives and girlfriends. ""When you see Murray Bartlett, or Ellen Page, who plays Shauna Hawkins, you can you can feel the truth of what they're doing… In a way that you wouldn't if a straight actor was busy trying to distance himself or herself."" It isn't just diverse sexualities and genders that audiences can expect on their screens - the author also pushed for racial diversity too. ""When I wrote Tales of the City, 40 years ago, I was a little white boy straight out of the South and so too many of the people were white. For several of the characters in Tales, we've changed their racial component, because we wanted more black people in the show."" Younger generations of LGBT people may not be aware of Tales of the City existing prior to this Netflix series launching, but Maupin has been widely thanked by several generations of queer people for bringing their lives to the mainstream. They thank him for making wider society aware of the community's existence and importance when not many others would. ""This has been a long struggle. There's still plenty of people that need to hear it, because they believe their church or their parents, or their repressive country about who they are. ""To know that I've told a story that has endured and people want to keep knowing about these people, that's the best a writer can ask for."" Tales of the City is on Netflix now.

"Police say 80 people are currently presumed dead after the fire at the west London tower block on 14 June. Adele encouraged fans at the show to donate money to help the victims of the blaze. She said Wembley's prices were ""extortionate"" and asked the crowd to donate rather than waste the money on ""overpriced wine"". ""It's been two weeks since the fire, and still the people who were affected by it are homeless,"" Adele said in a video message before the show. ""I promise that the money we raise together will go directly to the people who are living in that block."" Later in the show, on she said on stage: ""Usually I ask everyone to get their phone out and put their lights on. But before I do that I want you to donate. ""Did anyone see the video before I came on? I've been down to Grenfell tower. ""I can't tell you how out of control and how chaotic it still is down there, it's been two weeks since this happened... it's atrocious that we can't get answers. She added: ""It's our job as human beings to be compassionate... You'll be hearing a lot more from me about [Grenfell] in the days and weeks and probably years to come."" She dedicated her song Hometown Glory to the victims of the fire and encouraged them to give money to Unite for Grenfell. The concert was attended by 98,000 fans - a stadium record for a UK music event. She has three further dates at Wembley this week - the final one on Sunday. ""I wanted my final shows to be in London because I don't know if I'll ever tour again,"" she said in a message printed in the programmes. ""I've done 119 shows and these last four will take me up to 123, it has been hard out an absolute thrill and pleasure to have done."" Analysis: Alex Stanger, entertainment reporter Adele: great voice, that's a given, but the best bits of last night's gig were actually in between the songs. After starting the show with, not surprisingly, Hello, Adele told the audience she was extremely nervous about playing Wembley for the first time. But she shouldn't have been. Her banter alone had the audience in the palm of her hand. From complaining that her dress was too tight to admitting that she will be marking the end of her epic world tour on Sunday with fags and whisky, Adele showed she may be the world's biggest singing star but she's still one of us. And she struck the right note when talking about Grenfell Tower. The building's burnt out remains featured in the video which accompanied Hometown Glory, a song which already induces goosebumps. She asked the crowd, the biggest ever at a gig at Wembley, to donate to the victims of Grenfell and promised she would be back on the ground, helping those families displaced by the fire, as soon as the Wembley run finishes. To be able to talk about something so horrific, but then pick her audience back up again to enjoy the rest of the show, proved Adele's deft hand at performing.

"Steve Coogan has gone from playing the hapless Norfolk-based TV and radio host to playing one half of legendary comedy duo Laurel and Hardy in a new film. The first photo has been released of Coogan as Laurel alongside Guardians of the Galaxy actor John C Reilly, who plays Oliver Hardy in Stan & Ollie. The film, which follows the pair on their farewell tour, will close the BFI London Film Festival on 21 October. That will be its world premiere, ahead of its cinema release next January. Laurel and Hardy earned their places as all-time comedy greats by starring in more than 100 films together from the 1920s to the 1950s. Stan & Ollie is described as a ""heart-warming story"" that follows the pair on their ""triumphant"" final tour of UK and Ireland in 1953. It has been penned by Jeff Pope, who wrote 2013's Oscar-nominated Philomena with Coogan. Director Jon S Baird said: ""Stan & Ollie, at its heart, is a love story between old friends who just happen to be two of the most iconic comedic characters in Hollywood's history.""

"Will GompertzArts editor@WillGompertzBBCon Twitter Their creative juices were flowing all right, but the client wasn't buying any of their fancy-pants puns or arty references. He wanted something more direct, less hyperbolic. Saying it was ""Simply the Best"" accompanied by Tina Turner belting out her 1989 hit obviously wasn't going to do the trick. So instead they settled on: ""Ronseal Woodstain - it does exactly what it says on the tin."" It was hardly Shakespearian but it worked. Which you could also say about The Tina Turner Musical, a West End jukebox show that does exactly what it says… Except. And this is a major exception. Except for the titular performance given by Adrienne Warren. The American actress is not unlike the chap in the Ronseal ads, in that she is not a household name. Yet. She will be though. And that's because very few performers have the ability to transform the ordinary into extraordinary in the way she does with this show. Warren is a 24-carat, all singing, all dancing, bona fide star. She starts slow and a little tentative; reflecting the early steps Anna-Mae Bullock was taking on her journey to becoming Tina Turner. At 17, Anna-Mae meets Ike Turner (Kobna Holdbrook-Smith) who schmoozes her mother (Zelma Bullock) and then abuses her gifted daughter. For 16 years. The early Ike and Tina scenes see him forcibly shaping his musical protegee. Cymbals fly and a menacing finger is wagged in what feels like a direct lift from J.K. Simmons's merciless jazz teacher in Damien Chazelle's Oscar-winning movie Whiplash. The show stutters at this point but then bursts into sonic life when we first hear Warren give full vent to her voice. It is as if she's drawing up the sound from deep within the earth and releasing it in a controlled eruption with a Janis Joplin-meets-Tina-Turner growl. She is, Ike tells us, ""spitting fire"". The hits - 23 in all - are rolled out in a reasonably subtle manner (not always the case with this type of fare), woven, as they are, into the chronology of her life story, which is told through Katori Hall's rather disappointingly two-dimensional script. I say disappointing, because Hall is generally a very good writer and you'd have thought Tina Turner's tumultuous life story would have provided a feast of opportunities into which she could sink her playwriting teeth. What we have is a serviceable script elegantly staged by the experienced and astute Phyllida Lloyd (Mamma Mia!), who uses an uncluttered, layered, geometric set to good effect. She has had to overcome one of the trickier aspects of staging a musical production, which is to figure out a workable plan for getting actors and objects on and off stage in a seamless manner. It is a technical problem that is exacerbated in this production by the frequency and speed of the costume changes Warren is required to make. There are a couple of occasions where Lloyd appears to have been so flummoxed by the logistics of it all that she's given up, leaving the unfortunate Warren to strip to her underwear and perform an awkward costume change in front of the audience. There are other moments though, when you sit back and enjoy the intelligence and wit of her direction. Most memorably in a scene in which Phil Spector (Tom Godwin) takes over from Ike as Tina's producer and has her sing River Deep Mountain High with such intensity and ferocity that there is absolutely nothing left of the song when she's finally done. If this show had premiered on Broadway and not the West End, the audience would have risen as one and given her a standing ovation at this point. But this is low-key London not noisy New York, so we sat still. Until, that is, Warren donned her big 1980s Tina wig and started to belt out The Best. Nobody could resist that. Up we all went with a gentle side-to-side sway and the occasional self-conscious shoulder inflection. I turned round and saw the lady herself three rows back beaming from ear-to-ear. She'd enjoyed the show. Everyone seemed to be enjoying the show. OK, it's not Hamilton, but then, nothing is Hamilton. But it is a decent alternative for fans of the musical genre who can't get tickets to Lin-Manuel Miranda's blockbuster and are in need of a fix. You never know, The Tina Turner Musical might just run as long as those Ronseal ads.","Back in 1994, when Tina Turner was moving into her new home in Switzerland, a couple of advertising copywriters in London were having a terrible time trying to come up with a strapline for a wood varnish product."
"By Ian YoungsEntertainment & arts reporter ""That's probably as many people as would normally look at my Twitter,"" the Little Britain star says. But the video for his revised Baked Potato Song has now had three million views, and he is about to release it to raise funds for his FeedNHS campaign. ""When the idea was put to me, it was a no brainer,"" he tells BBC News. Lucas first duetted with a baked potato on madcap comedy quiz Shooting Stars, where the singing vegetable delivered some sensible life lessons - from ""Do be early, don't be late"" to ""Always eat what's on your plate"". ""Sometimes people write to me about that song because it appeared on Shooting Stars about 20 years ago, and it's something that people still remember,"" Lucas says. He was inspired to revisit it after seeing footage of people socialising last Tuesday, when he was already in isolation. ""I was just trying to think of a way of helping to spread the message rather than the virus, and I thought, if I can connect with kids, then maybe the kids can tell their parents,"" he says. ""I was sat at my piano and I just remembered the baked potato song."" In its new incarnation, the baked potato instructs people to wash their hands, stay indoors and not touch their faces. ""I watched over the next 48 hours as it went viral, and three million people have viewed it on Twitter,"" says Lucas. ""And then people started doing their own versions and their own animations. And kids were filming themselves singing it and sending it to me, and it sort of took on a life of its own."" As that was happening, Lucas was speaking to actors Damian Lewis and Helen McCrory, as well as the boss of food chain Leon, to set up a campaign that would provide hot meals to NHS workers. FeedNHS is aiming to take food from the thousands of cafes, restaurants and canteens that have been forced to shut down and send it to hospitals. A fundraising page has already raised almost £600,000. ""I have an aunt who's in hospital at the moment with the virus. I know two people who've passed away from it,"" Lucas explains. ""People message me on social media to say they work in the NHS and they're completely oversubscribed. So it was pretty plain and simple to all of us that we should try and get them at least one hot meal a day, and it's good quality food as well."" So a singing baked potato will be helping to feed doctors and nurses. Lucas is about to become the new co-host of The Great British Bake Off and is rumoured to be working on new Little Britain material with David Walliams. But he says he's not using the time afforded by isolation to work on comedy scripts. ""The only creative thing I've done in the last two and a half weeks is rewrite the lyrics to this song,"" he says. ""I've only been focused on this charity, my family and my friends. ""I want to be able to look back and think that I tried to do something to help some people during this particular crisis. I have asthma so I have to isolate. But many people are literally risking their lives to help people."" Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

"By Lauren TurnerEntertainment reporter When Gone Girl became a best-seller, some people were taken aback by its protagonist Amy, played by Rosamund Pike in the film. The problem was, she just wasn't... nice. And that's exactly the way Gillian Flynn, who wrote the book on which the 2014 film was based, wanted it. It wasn't the author's first rodeo either, having set out her stall creating dark, complex female lead characters with her 2006 debut Sharp Objects. That novel has now also been adapted the screen. It stars Amy Adams as Camille, a journalist with a troubled past who is sent to her hometown to report on a young girl's murder. So why did Flynn decide to write such disturbed, and at times disturbing, characters? Well, you can blame so-called ""chick lit"". 'Get the guy, get the shoes' ""I wanted to write about a dark, damaged, screwed-up, troubled female protagonist,"" she tells BBC News. ""Those male characters were everywhere you looked - and have been for hundreds of years in literature. That's just been the archetype. ""I just didn't see enough of that anywhere, so I just thought 'I'll write it'. At that time, it was the very height of chick lit, with books like Bridget Jones's Diary. ""They're all great books and all fun - get the guy, get the right shoes and live happily ever after. It was driving me slowly insane. ""I sat down to write the opposite. I mean, you never hear Camille talking about her shoe-wear."" That's putting it mildly. The Camille we see in the series is battling demons from her past - including her fraught relationship with her mother Adora, played by Patricia Clarkson - and bearing the scars of self-harm. Flynn, who has written three episodes and is a producer on the HBO series, admits things have changed since her debut, with dark, complex characters now ""much more common"". But, she says, ""I've written them ever since. I just can't seem to stop. I remember writing the second one, thinking: 'I'd better not write another troubled, dark narrator'. ""But it's what I'm interested in. The more types of women we see is what's important."" Flynn admits that Gone Girl ""opened the door"" to a wider variety of female characters. ""And it made a lot of money!"" she laughs. ""Anything that makes a lot of money will make publishers say 'we want more of that'. ""It's really important that it's talked about - let's see more of every kind of woman. That's why I wrote her in the first place. There are women in pain, screwing up, struggling and yet managing to keep their heads above water. ""For any woman out there thinking there's a person they're not seeing in literature, just write it! That, to me, was the whole point."" 'No cardboard cut-outs' So how does Flynn answer the criticism she's received from some quarters that she's been ""misogynistic"" in her portrayal of women? ""I think it's misogynist to say it's misogynist to write about bad women,"" she says. ""Anytime you tell a woman what she can and can't write about, that's misogyny. ""I mostly ignore it. It's such an insane thing to say, as if you're too delicate to bear the idea of a negative portrayal of a woman."" Literature has moved to represent women in a way that films and TV often haven't, Flynn muses. ""I think they have a long way to go,"" she adds. ""It's important to be able to look on a screen, and turn pages, and see a recognisable human woman, rather than a cardboard cut-out."" Not that there's any chance of Adams being described by anyone in such a way. Flynn singles the Arrival star out for praise. ""She has this incredibly unique combination of vulnerability, but also steeliness,"" she enthuses. ""You see her being able to show empathy on screen but also, you don't worry about her too much - you worry about her just the right amount. ""You don't think she's ever going to break; she has this unbreakable quality. Camille is a very damaged human being, but you're not so concerned that you can't bear it. ""You have a realisation this is a woman who has been through a lot."" 'Hooking the umbilical cord in' The mother-daughter relationship at the centre of Sharp Objects was ""very important"", says Flynn. ""It's something else that I wasn't seeing enough of in literature. I think there can be something about that relationship that's really toxic, and symbiotic in a very odd way. ""Camille has stayed away, and now she's hooking the umbilical cord back in, into that sick place. And she has to do it to figure out what's going on."" Seeing Adams and Clarkson together were ""some of the most disturbing and hard-to-watch scenes"", the author admits. ""Because Camille was so young when things happened and things were going wrong, she's never really been able to process it or confront it - because the truth is so horrifying,"" says Flynn. ""She's buried it, but that pain wants to bear witness. I've certainly gone through periods of deep psychological pain. ""That feeling when you're in such terrible pain and you can still manage to walk around and slap on a smile. It's a horrifying and frightening thing. ""You want to scream - 'can't you see how much pain I'm in? Is no-one seeing this?' For Camille she was cutting, because she wanted that pain to be seen, to be witnessed."" 'Echoes of myself' Flynn admits that much has changed for her since she wrote Sharp Objects 12 years ago - and says the process of bringing it to the screen was much longer than was the case for Gone Girl. ""I wrote it in my late '20s, early '30s, and I was living in a different city,"" she explains. ""I hadn't even met my husband. I can hear the echoes of myself in there, from a different time period."" The author admits she hasn't read the book since then, saying she tends not to read her own work once it's finished. ""So to revisit it and see those characters come to life again... it's like a carnival, being put on in front of your eyes,"" she smiles. Sharp Objects is available on Sky Atlantic and Now TV.

"Amol RajanMedia editor@amolrajanon Twitter These four internets are, broadly: the open, universalist version envisioned by the web's pioneers; the current, largely Californian internet dominated by a few tech giants (Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook); a more regulated, European internet; and an authoritarian, walled-garden approach, of the kind seen in China, which has its own tech giants (Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent). Most of the stories that I end up covering for BBC News chronicle various attempts to navigate from the second (Californian) internet to the third (European, regulated). What you might call 'the Southampton argument' is based on an irresistible and irrefutable claim: that there is no one internet, applicable to all humanity, and arising in all places; rather there are several iterations of this revolutionary technology, of which the four articulated by our friends in Southampton are simply the most prominent. As our species grapples with the unprecedented disruption, life-improving possibilities, and terrifying potential harms of digital technology, a battle is raging to shape the future of the internet. According to the best estimates, last year was the moment that - for the first time - more people were online than off-line. That means almost half of humanity is still up for grabs. What kind of internet will these people, around three billion of them, come into? In the past year, several articles, such as this Economist briefing, have noted that the companies which dominate the internet today are desperately battling for the attention of those three billion future users. This is the context in which Sir Nick Clegg is speaking in Berlin on Monday. Europe's leading role In his first speech and interview since joining Facebook, Sir Nick chose Brussels as his location. On Monday, he chose the German capital. It isn't mere Europhilia dictating his travel plans, as if the former trade negotiator were trying to relive his youth. It is, in fact, cold, hard commercial need. Facebook knows regulation is coming. It has noticed that most of the smart thinking on regulation is coming from Europe. It wants to shape that regulation before that regulation shapes Facebook. Mark Zuckerberg hired Sir Nick to explain Facebook to Europe and Europe to Facebook. In the past two years, we have seen what amounts to quite radical shifts in the relationship between technology companies and the law, emanating principally from Brussels. GDPR, the name for new data rules, is generally thought to have shifted power back to consumers (albeit at the price of constantly clicking on pop-up boxes on various websites). The most powerful blow to Google's dominance of various sectors has come from the Competition Commissioner in Brussels. And Britain's Online Harms White Paper, which boasts of implementing the toughest internet laws in the world, was cooked up between the Home Office and Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport in Whitehall. This amounts to an onslaught. Sir Nick is being paid to deal with it on behalf of the tech giant. The opening line of his speech will assert that Facebook actively seeks regulation. It wants new rules on privacy, electoral law, hate speech and data portability. And it is quite happy for those rules to be devised in Europe. Why? Culture, mainly. I have written at length on this blog about the tech-lash, a phrase Sir Nick is using today, and the clash between the world views of Silicon Valley and Europe. A libertarian culture that prizes autonomy over order and is profoundly sceptical of government is often ill-suited to devising smart new legislation of a quickly evolving sector. China, meanwhile, has a completely different set of norms about what the citizen's experience of the internet should be. But in much of Europe, not least Brussels and Berlin, there is a presumption that effective legislation is possible, plausible, and totally necessary. So Facebook is quite relaxed about these new rules coming from Europe rather than, say, the White House of a President they fear is temperamental. Shaping the future Or indeed from China, which Facebook understands less well and has yet to penetrate commercially in the way it would like. Plus, the social media giant is an also-ran when compared with the Chinese tech giants of Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent. Though it has yet to seep into public consciousness, and escape the land of policy wonks, a Cold War is already underway between the US and China, with trade and technology being the two main fronts. How technology companies are being mobilised by the American and Chinese governments as part of this war is not fully clear. That said, in America, the tech giants are fiercely independent of, and yet in political friction with, the government. In China, they are in the lap of government. Europe, which lacks a tech giant, and has that culture of favouring regulation, is therefore unusually well placed to plan the future of the internet. That future is one where the new users - those transitioning from off-line to online - are generally poorer than today's users; much less likely to speak English; and almost certain to be mobile-first (as opposed to laptop or tablet). Though they have less money, they are a juicy commercial proposition for American corporate behemoths who are thinking long-term, as is their wont. Sceptics might point out that with the political heat turned up to maximum in Washington and parts of Europe, Facebook and Sir Nick are trying to grasp the initiative so that they are not broken up: a prospect that is being threatened with ever greater frequency. Hyper-alert to such threats, conditioned by a long-term, even epochal, mindset, and concerned about the authoritarian turn in Asia, Facebook is determined that the future of the internet is shaped more in Brussels and Berlin than Beijing. Though they cast themselves as a global community above mere politics, Sir Nick's second consecutive speech in Europe, and his accommodating approach to new laws, shows a company evolving from a libertarian to a liberal disposition. Facebook is not an apolitical entity championing universal human values. It is an unprecedentedly powerful corporation, born of and conditioned by specific historical circumstances, and led by liberals with their own particular experiences and affiliations. Sir Nick's fondness for Europe just happens to be highly expedient.","In recent months I have been influenced by a paper on The Geopolitics of Digital Governance by two University of Southampton academics, Kieron O'Hara and Dame Wendy Hall.

"She-Hulk has superhuman strength and speed and is one of the most formidable hand-to-hand combatants in the Marvel world. Like Hulk, not only does she have physical power, she's also completely green. Yet, on a 1991 comic book cover, she is shown in a seductive pose, wearing a G-string bikini, with her curves sharply accentuated. Indian artist Shreya Arora was shocked when she saw the image. ""For Hulk, the visual representation focuses on his strength. For She-Hulk, all we see is an emphasis on sexuality,"" says Arora, who grew up reading comic books. The 21-year-old graphic designer decided she wanted to flip the narrative. Her artwork draws inspiration from comic book covers but parodies the male superheroes using body language typically associated with women. The result - covers with familiar characters, such as Superman and Batman, in strikingly unusual poses and outfits. A scantily-clad Spiderman is pictured in only a thong, a coy Hulk covers himself with a newspaper, while an Iron Man with prominent buttocks crawls on a ledge. ""The way female heroines are drawn would never be applied to men,"" Arora tells BBC 100 Women. Marvel, DC and other publishers in the comic world have been accused of sexism before. But Arora, who is in her third year at the National Institute of Design in Ahmedabad, says she only noticed the issue while she was studying in France. ""Maybe seeing comics with text in a language I wasn't familiar with, made me focus more on the visuals,"" she says. Part of the problem is that ""comic books are very often drawn by men, for men to enjoy"", she argues. ""The current depiction of superheroines exists because of this vicious cycle. Companies decide on a specific target market and then use that demographic as a reason to continue the same problematic process of content creation. ""I wish comic book publishers would see that there is definitely a market for more inclusive comics."" Her project has been criticised for not acknowledging that comics show not only female characters with unrealistic body shapes and poses, but male ones too. Arora maintains the comics are misogynistic, particularly on the front covers. ""Body standards for men, with huge biceps and rock-hard abs, exist to make them look strong and powerful, which superheroes are known for,"" she says. ""The body standards for women are tweaked to make them look sexy. ""People deem the body types of real-life athletic, strong women, like Serena Williams, 'too masculine'. ""If creators wanted to make superheroines look strong, they have plenty of real life inspiration to choose from."" Arora is working on other projects that look at sexist representations of the female body and gender imbalance in media. She is behind a bogus magazine ad showing a woman with zipped-up lips, unable to speak out against domestic abuse. Her image of a magazine cover has the headline, ""Why getting sexually assaulted is your fault"" - a prompt to start a conversation about victim-blaming. ""While there are a lot of young, passionate artists currently working on social issues and starting important conversations, even these conversations have a privilege bar - people with access to the internet, fluent in English, and to an extent, visually literate,"" says Arora. ""But there are people in India and other countries, who do not fit these criteria. I want to bridge the gap between all this good intent, and the lack of impact at a grass-roots level"".

"By Steve HoldenNewsbeat Reporter Any 90's TV fan will remember Richard O'Brien's famous catchphrase from one of the decade's most popular shows - The Crystal Maze. Now, 25 years after it first aired on Channel 4, plans are under way to bring the show back as a live immersive theatrical experience. It means fans of the show may finally get the chance to take part in a fully-realised replica set in London. If you're over the age of 30 and you never saw it (and quite frankly... where were you?) the scale of The Crystal Maze was epic. Filmed at a huge air hangar in Essex, teams of six would complete a series of mental and physical challenges in different themed zones (Aztec, Industrial, Medieval, Futuristic and, later, Ocean). The aim was to collect crystals in order to determine how long they would spend within a crystal dome - inside which they would try and grab golden tickets - in the show's finale. It first aired in February 1990 and regularly attracted five to six million viewers per episode, running for six series. Bringing it back I was one of the lucky few to actually be a contestant on the show, appearing on a children's special in 1992. It was just as much fun as you'd expect. So, at a studio in east London, I meet the three producers hoping to make the new Crystal Maze a reality. To realise the dream of bringing back The Crystal Maze, they're turning to the public for help, via a crowdfunding project. There may be a long way to go, but they are boosted by the fact that ... yes... original host Richard O'Brien is involved. ""He (Richard) took a bit of tracking down as he now lives in New Zealand,"" says Ben Hodges. ""He took a bit of persuading. We had to pitch the idea and he had very high standards but eventually he came on board."" Hodges, along with co-producers Tom Lionetti-Maguire and Dean Rodgers, make up Little Lion Entertainment - the team behind the project. O'Brien's exact role is being kept secret though it's unlikely he'll be taking recruits around any newly constructed maze, playing his harmonica or introducing contestants to his 'Mumsie'. He does, however, appear in the video to launch the project. ""We've calculated we need a minimum of £500,000 to make something we're happy with,"" says Hodges. ""The appetite to take part would be great."" Wearing customised Crystal Maze bomber jackets, it's clear the Little Lion team are all massive fans of the show. ""My biggest memory was just how incredibly extravagant it was. It was crazy, it was over the top,"" says Lionetti-Maguire. ""The idea is simple. We're keeping the show as it was but opening it up to everyone to go and experience,"" says Hodges. ""It's such a great show so there's no real need to change it."" The producers point to the recent successes of Puzzle Rooms, where people pay to spend 60 minutes in a locked room attempting to find enough clues to escape, as proof audiences are hungry for the kind of immersive experience the Crystal Maze show will offer. ""It taps into the right level of trend surrounding the puzzle room experiences currently out there,"" says Dean. ""The people who watched The Crystal Maze when they were kids are the ones going to these puzzle rooms. ""It's the best marrying of ideas and is about capturing the zeitgeist."" The plan is to allow teams of six to take part in a series of games and finish inside a replica crystal dome, complete with working fans which are used to toughen the challenge of grabbing as many golden leaflets as possible. The producers say they've got a ""bible of games"" from the show's original creator Malcolm Hayworth, who is also on board. As well as raising the capital, they still have to find an exact location in London that's large enough to build the set - originally the size of two football pitches. A couple of sites are being earmarked, is all the producers will say. Fans can now register their interest to take part in the experience and, if everything goes to plan, the immersive Crystal Maze will launch in late 2015.","""Will you start the fans please!"""
"Petty ""suffered from many serious ailments...most significantly a fractured hip"", the statement said. Family members say they believe he was overusing prescription pain medication when he died in October aged 66. Petty found fame as the lead singer of Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers, with hits like American Girl and Breakdown. He was also a co-founder of the Traveling Wilburys group in the late 1980s, recording albums with Bob Dylan, Roy Orbison, Jeff Lynne and George Harrison. Petty was found unconscious, not breathing and in full cardiac arrest at his Malibu home on 2 October. He was taken to hospital, but could not be revived and died later that evening. Petty's family met with a medical examiner on Friday morning and updated his fans on Facebook. ""On the day he died he was informed his hip had graduated to a full on break and it is our feeling that the pain was simply unbearable and was the cause for his over use of medication"", the statement said. ""We knew before the report was shared with us that he was prescribed various pain medications for a multitude of issues including Fentanyl patches and we feel confident that this was, as the coroner found, an unfortunate accident."" They added that his death ""may spark a further discussion on the opioid crisis and we feel that is a necessary and healthy discussion"". The Los Angeles coroner's office attributed his death to ""multisystem organ failure"" due to a ""mixed toxicity"" of seven medications. They are fentanyl, oxycodone, emazepam, alprazolam, citalopram, acetyl fentanyl, and despropionyl fentanyl. Years of over-prescription of opioid painkillers in the US has created a nationwide addiction crisis, with patients turning to heroin and other street drugs when their prescriptions stop. In 2016, opioid-related overdoses increased by 28%, killing 42,249 people.","US musician Tom Petty died of an accidental overdose after taking various painkillers, according to a statement issued by his family."
"Latest TV - based in Sussex - and Lincolnshire Living for Grimsby will be broadcast on Freeview and have been awarded 12-year licences. In total, Ofcom received 57 bids to run the new US-style local TV stations across the UK. It said further licences would be awarded in the coming months and hoped the channels would be on air next year. The media regulator initially invited operators to submit their applications covering 21 areas in May, however as no bidders came forward in Swansea or Plymouth, only 19 licences will be awarded. They will be based on a set of criteria including the provision of local news and current affairs, programme proposals, launch date and commercial viability. Brighton and Grimsby were the first to be announced as both areas only attracted one bid and there were no competing bids to consider. Lincolnshire Living is an extension of the Grimsby-based Channel 7 local TV service which has been broadcasting on Virgin Media for the past 15 years as Seven. Executive producer Lia Nici told the BBC the channel was ""over the moon"" to be awarded the licence. ""We're one successful model of local TV in the UK so now we can continue to extend our service and be available to a wider audience,"" she said. ""We intend to make sure programming is either locally relevant or locally produced.""

"The singer, who died suddenly on 15 January aged 46, was found submerged in the bath in her room at London's Park Lane Hilton hotel. O'Riordan died as a result of a ""tragic accident"", the coroner said. She had no injuries or evidence of self harm, and had drunk an excessive amount of alcohol, expert witnesses said. She had been in the Park Lane Hilton hotel as part of a recording trip ahead of a 2018 tour. PC Natalie Smart, who attended the scene, told the inquest: ""I saw Mrs O'Riordan submerged in the bath with her nose and mouth fully under the water."" The inquest heard that there were empty bottles in the room - five miniature bottles and a bottle of champagne - as well as containers of prescription drugs with a quantity of tablets in each container. Toxicology tests showed only ""therapeutic"" amounts of medication in O'Riordan's blood, but showed up 330mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood - meaning she was more than four times over the 80mg legal limit for driving. The inquest was attended by O'Riordan's mother, brother and sister-in-law. She split from her husband of 20 years, Don Burton, in 2014. She and Burton, who is the former tour manager of Duran Duran, have three children together. The inquest heard that the singer checked into the hotel on 14 January. She was in touch with room service at around midnight and phoned her mother at around 03:00 GMT. She was later found unresponsive in the bathroom and confirmed dead at 09:16. The inquest heard that O'Riordan had bipolar disorder but responded well to treatment. The hearing was also told that she went through periods of abstention and periods of excessive drinking. She had spoken to psychiatrist Dr Seamus O Ceallaigh on 9 January and was in ""good spirits"". The inquest coincided with the day that would have been O'Riordan's 47th birthday. In a statement issued after the hearing, The Cranberries said: ""Dolores will live on eternally in her music."" The band's statement in full: On January 15th 2018 we lost our dear friend and band mate Dolores O'Riordan. ""Today we continue to struggle to come to terms with what happened. ""Our heartfelt condolences go out to Dolores' children and her family and our thoughts are with them today. ""Dolores will live on eternally in her music. To see how much of a positive impact she had on people's lives has been a source of great comfort to us. ""We'd like to say thank you to all of our fans for the outpouring of messages and their continued support during this very difficult time. ""We request, please, for our privacy to be respected at this time."" During the 90s, the Irish musician led the band to international success and their hit singles including Linger and Zombie. The band embarked on a UK and European tour in 2017, but it had to be cancelled in May as a result of O'Riordan's health issues. The official Cranberries website cited ""medical reasons associated with a back problem"" that prevented O'Riordan from performing. But just before Christmas, the singer had posted on Facebook saying she was ""feeling good"" and had done her ""first bit of gigging in months"", leading fans to believe she would soon be on tour again.

"In a rare public work, she has written an inscription for a stone that will be placed near the Brontes' home. Bush said being asked to pen a passage about Emily was ""an honour and, in a way, a chance to say thank you to her"". She's one of four artists who have written messages about the sisters. Poet laureate Carol Ann Duffy has crafted a passage for a stone dedicated to Charlotte Bronte, fellow poet Jackie Kay has created a tribute to Anne, and the fourth inscription, by author Jeanette Winterson, will reflect on the Bronte legacy as a whole. The four stones will form a trail between the family home in Haworth and the sisters' birthplace seven miles away in Thornton. They will be unveiled as part of Bradford Literature Festival on 7 July. In a statement, Bush said: ""I am delighted to be involved in this project. Each sister being remembered by a stone in the enigmatic landscape where they lived and worked is a striking idea. ""Emily only wrote the one novel - an extraordinary work of art that has truly left its mark. To be asked to write a piece for Emily's stone is an honour and, in a way, a chance to say thank you to her."" The musician and songwriter seldom takes part in public projects and has been out of the spotlight since performing 22 shows in London in 2014 and releasing an accompanying live album two years later.

""We felt that Kate would be a great person to write about Emily Bronte,"" she told BBC News. ""She's such an icon and so much of her work references literature, so it felt like she would be the perfect person to respond to Emily and write something for the stone. ""We weren't sure whether she would do it but we were absolutely delighted when she said yes. It was one of those - we won't know unless we ask. So we asked, and she said yes, and we were tremendously excited. ""This is the only public thing she's doing about the fact that it's the 40th anniversary of Wuthering Heights.

The first edition ran fairly smoothly, although there was a slightly sticky moment when the weather presenter referred viewers to the Daybreak website during the 07:45 update. Good Morning Britain's main exclusive was with Paul O'Grady - giving his first interview since he was in hospital late last year with recurring heart problems. Digital Spy's Fletcher wrote: ""The first 'big guest' on Good Morning Britain is Paul O'Grady talking about his recovery from his latest heart attack. It's not exactly A-list and it's a strange shift from the fast-paced hard news style of the rest of the show. However, Ben and Susanna are more adept at switching between the desk and the sofa than any of the Daybreak hosts ever were."" Yahoo News said the programme had a ""shaky start"" and listed ""teething issues"" that included distracting graphics and quick camera cuts. Reviewer Rachel MacGregor was particularly unimpressed with the opening sequence, noting: ""Reid, Shephard, Fletcher and Hawkins each read a news story directly to the camera before the next presenter jumped in with another headline. The frequent handovers meant that we saw little interaction between the hosts to begin with, so any mention of their 'chemistry' seemed very forced."" However, she added, ""as time went on the presenters seemed to become more comfortable with each other"". Stateside comparisons ITV This Morning presenter, Holly Willoughby, was impressed, tweeting: ""Good Morning Britain is looking rather lovely... Good morning y'all!"" Regular viewers on Twitter had mixed feelings, with one writing: ""#Good Morning Britain looks like loose women crossed with Nintendo Wii's version of Sky Sports News."" But former BBC Three and BBC London television presenter, Matt Cooke tweeted: ""Very slick, fresh US look for @GMB - seems to have far fewer ads than usual ITV morning shows. And @andipeters is back too - hurrah!"" Another viewer, Andrew Trythall, tweeted: ""#GoodMorningBritain was a great looking show, fast-paced, fresh and engaging. Great directing @errongordon. Well done to the whole team."" And Helena Cauldon also praised the programme on Twitter: ""Loved the new-look Good Morning Britain today - great launch."" Kaine Milner wrote: ""I'm definitely a fan of this new ""#GoodMorningBritain show @GMB, faster paced news, less adverts and just generally better than dreary BBC."" But Patricia O'Neill wasn't impressed, tweeting: ""Thought I was watching the wrong channel!! Bring back the sofa with Kate and Aled!!"" And Margaret Oliver tweeted: ""@GMB sorry doesn't do it for me. Bring back Daybreak."" Several commentators likened the look of the new programme to ABC's long-running breakfast show Good Morning America. ""Good Morning Amer... sorry, Britain! Yes, with its four-strong team of presenters - the women clad in primary colours - seated around a big glass desk, and a weather expert who gets to add her two cents to the chat, ITV's new breakfast news show owes a lot to its stateside counterpart,"" wrote Paul Jones in his Radio Times review. The Daily Mail, however, was not a fan of the desk, complaining it hid Reid's legs from view. ""Later on the show, however, Susanna moved from behind the desk, giving viewers the chance to catch a glimpse of her enviable pins,"" it reported. Good Morning Britain replaces ITV's previous breakfast show, Daybreak, which launched to great fanfare in 2010. The show, fronted by former One Show hosts Adrian Chiles and Christine Bleakley, saw a temporary boost in viewing figures, but they soon settled back to previous levels and the presenters were sidelined. The show ran through four editors in its brief lifespan. The name Good Morning Britain was previously used by ITV from 1983 to 1992, and is chiefly associated with Anne Diamond and Nick Owen. Louise Minchin has been presenting BBC Breakfast alongside Bill Turnbull since Reid left - an announcement about a permanent replacement is expected in the autumn.","Critics and viewers have delivered their verdict on ITV's latest breakfast programme, fronted by Susanna Reid."
"The 82-year-old told the CBS This Morning show he was diagnosed three-and-a-half years ago but had only decided to speak about it now. ""The reason I want to talk about it in public is... I've had a full life since then,"" he said. ""You still have things you can do,"" he went on, revealing he was ""taking boxing lessons three times a week."" Parkinson's is a progressive condition in which the brain becomes damaged. It can lead to tremors, difficulty moving, speech changes and eventually memory problems. Alda is best known for playing Captain Benjamin Franklin ""Hawkeye"" Pierce in the TV series M*A*S*H from 1972 to 1983. He went on to play presidential candidate Arnold Vinick in The West Wing and was Oscar nominated in 2005 for The Aviator. Alda said he had noticed during recent interviews to promote his new podcast that he ""could see [his] thumb twitch in some shots"". ""I thought, it's probably only a matter of time before somebody does a story about this from a sad point of view but that's not where I am,"" he continued. Alda said he had gone to his doctor to ask for a scan because he suspected he might have the disease. ""I read an article by Jane Brody in the New York Times that indicated that if you act out your dreams, there's a good chance that might be a very early symptom where nothing else shows,"" he explained. ""I was having a dream that someone was attacking me and I threw a sack of potatoes at them, but what I was really doing was throwing a pillow at my wife."" He continued: ""This is not to short-change people who are suffering with really severe symptoms. Symptoms can get very bad, and their families can suffer. ""But in the very beginning, to be immobilised by fear and think the worst thing has happened to you... you still have things you can do."" What is Parkinson's? Parkinson's disease is a condition in which parts of the brain become progressively damaged over many years. The three main symptoms of Parkinson's disease are involuntary shaking of particular parts of the body, slow movement and stiff and inflexible muscles. A person with Parkinson's disease can also experience a wide range of other physical and psychological symptoms, including depression and anxiety, balance problems, loss of sense of smell, difficulty sleeping and memory problems. Source: NHS Steve Ford, CEO of Parkinson's UK, praised Alda's revelation, saying it would help to ""shine a light on a condition that affects 145,000 people in the UK and more than 10 million worldwide"". ""The more Parkinson's is discussed the more understanding there will be, along with the vital need to drive forward research."" Actor Michael J Fox was diagnosed with young-onset Parkinson's disease in 1991, when he was 30 years old. He later set up a foundation to fund research and help find a cure. Other celebrities to suffer from the disease include comedian Billy Connolly, who was diagnosed in 2014, and singer Neil Diamond, who announced earlier this year he would retire from touring after a recent diagnosis.

"By Mark SavageBBC Music reporter Singer Robert Plant, guitarist Jimmy Page and Warner Music argue that the claimants have failed to make their case after three days of testimony. US District Judge R Gary Klausner is expected to hear arguments on the motion when the trial resumes later. The band are accused of basing Stairway on the 1968 Spirit song, Taurus. The case was brought by Michael Skidmore, who runs the estate of Spirit's late guitarist, Randy Wolfe. In court, Skidmore's lawyer, Francis Malofiy played both songs and attempted to establish that Page heard the song prior to writing Stairway to Heaven. The guitarist testified that he had not heard the Spirit track until a few years ago, and said the chord sequence was also similar to the Mary Poppins song Chim Chim Cher-ee. However, musicologist Dr Alexander Stewart told the court that the chord progressions in Taurus and Stairway ""both skip the E before resolving on an A note in an unusual way"". The claimants rested their case on Friday, and lawyers for Led Zeppelin filed to have the case dismissed on Monday. The defendants argue that Malofiy failed to put the copyright registration of Taurus into evidence; that the Wolfe Trustee does not own that copyright; and that he failed to establish that Led Zeppelin had heard Taurus before writing Stairway to Heaven. If the judge rules against the motion, the defence will start their case on Tuesday, with Robert Plant and bassist John Paul Jones expected to testify.",Lawyers for Led Zeppelin have asked a judge to throw out a case accusing the band of stealing the riff for Stairway to Heaven.
"By Tim MastersEntertainment correspondent The Ukrainian star, who shocked the dance world in 2012 when he quit the Royal Ballet, has branched out into film acting. He's made a spy thriller with Jennifer Lawrence, and appears in Sir Kenneth Branagh's forthcoming Murder on the Orient Express. ""I feel like I'm a kid again,"" the 27-year-old told the BBC of his time working on the Lawrence film. ""It's an amazing industry and it was really one of the best times of my life."" 'Surreal experience' Polunin hopes to make it a full-time career. ""I would love to. It's really good. It was the happiest time. I was excited to wake up. I still did a ballet class before, and then went to [work on] the movie."" He said that he learned a lot working with Lawrence on Red Sparrow. ""One moment she's very relaxed, and then in a second goes into the character. In a strong scene, she really goes for it."" The Orient Express film sees Polunin in the role of Count Andrenyi opposite Dame Judi Dench, Michelle Pfeiffer, Johnny Depp and Willem Dafoe. ""It was a very surreal experience,"" Polunin admitted. ""I thought: 'Am I supposed to be here? Am I good enough?' These were legends. I have paintings of these people!"" Polunin's relationship with ballet has been turbulent to say the least. A child prodigy, he left Ukraine at the age of 13 and came to the UK where he shone at the Royal Ballet School. At the age of 19 he became the Royal Ballet's youngest ever male principal. But two years later he sensationally walked out, amid reports of drug use and hard partying, earning himself the ""bad boy of ballet"" moniker. He later told the BBC that he was no fan of rehearsals, saying that it was only when performing that he enjoyed dancing. The story of his life in ballet is told in Dancer, a new cinema documentary by Steve Cantor. Polunin will perform at the film's premiere at the London Palladium later on Thursday. 'Imperfection is good' At the film's centre is the unforgettable 2015 YouTube video of Polunin's dance to Hozier's Take Me to Church. Shot in Hawaii by photographer David LaChapelle, Polunin's bare-chested ballet routine almost melted the internet when it went viral. It's since notched up more than 18 million views. As he explains in the documentary, Polunin had intended it to be his swan song. But the positive global reaction changed his mind. Later this month, the star unveils his latest dance production - Project Polunin - at Sadler's Wells. It includes the world premiere of Narcissus & Echo, a piece composed by Ilan Eshkeri with visuals by LaChapelle. Even with his promising film career, Polunin admits he may never shake off the ""bad boy"" tag. ""Two years ago we tried to change this image, but I don't think you can,"" he said, referring to the YouTube video. ""But the image of being not perfect - I like that. ""Our world isn't perfect - it's good to have some kind of imperfection."" Dancer is released on 10 March. Project Polunin is at Sadler's Wells from 14-18 March.

"Great British Bake Off winner Nadiya Hussain agrees: ""It's the hardest job I've ever done."" So are they talking about fame, acting, presenting? No, actually, they're talking about being a mum. The pair spoke to BBC Radio 5 Live for its #mumtakeover event, along with Loose Women panellist Stacey Solomon, who said she was ""fed a fairytale"". The frank videos posted on BBC Radio 5 Live website are part of the radio station's discussion on motherhood and mental health. Headey, a mother of two who suffered from postnatal depression after giving birth to her first child, said: ""You're last to get a shower. You come last in everything in the nicest possible way. But it isn't all doom and gloom. ""Relationships deepen everywhere because of it. Every day is funny,"" Headey, who plays Cersei Lannister in Game of Thrones, said. And her advice? ""Trust yourself and ask for help."" Hussain, a mother of three, said: ""The best thing I've learned about being a mum is not listening to anyone, I've got my instinct."" She also advised to ""just kind of take each day as it comes"". But the TV presenter warned: ""Someone gave me advice once - it gets easier. The truth is, it doesn't. Every phase, every year comes with its own challenges."" Solomon, who first found fame on X Factor, spoke of her struggles with post-natal depression following the birth of her first child.

"The band said they were ""humbled"" to beat Anne-Marie, Arctic Monkeys and George Ezra to win the top prize. Singer Matty Healy also used the best group acceptance speech to address misogyny in the music industry. However, some viewers found out about the band's big night in advance, after a rogue TV advert announced their win ahead of the ceremony. It is unclear whether the band knew they had won in advance, and they did not acknowledge the mix-up during the awards show. Other winners on the night included George Ezra and Jorja Smith, who won best male and female respectively. Ezra, who performed his number one single Shotgun at the event, said ""There's a not a day goes by where I don't count myself very lucky and this is the icing on the cake."" Calvin Harris bagged his first two Brit awards - from a total of 16 career nominations - for music producer of the year and best single, for One Kiss with Dua Lipa. He said on stage at London's O2: ""I've been coming here for a few years and never had the opportunity to say anything. ""I want to thank anyone that's bought a tune, streamed a tune, come to a show, listened to the song by accident on the radio and gone 'what's this?'. ""It means a lot."" One Kiss, his collaboration with Dua Lipa, spent eight weeks at number one and was the best-selling single of 2018, with more than 1.5million combined sales, streams and downloads. The pair now have five Brit awards between them - Lipa won best female and British breakthrough act at last year's show. Pop star Anne-Marie was this year's Craig David: Leaving empty-handed after going into the ceremony with four nominations. 'No shame' The show was packed with performances from some of the biggest British artists, including The 1975, Jess Glynne and Jorja Smith. Hugh Jackman opened the show with the theme song to the hit film The Greatest Showman, with his performance featuring hundreds of dancers, acrobats and fire-breathing extras. The movie soundtrack, which was not nominated for any awards, was the UK's best-selling album of 2018. Little Mix won best video for Woman Like Me, which they performed on the night, and admitted they had ""absolutely no shame in asking fans to vote for it every day"". This year's international winners were noticeably absent, with best male and female winners Drake and Ariana Grande sending in pre-recorded acceptance speeches. The Carters - aka Beyonce and Jay Z - won international group, and restaged the famous video for Ape****, which was shot in the Louvre, in their acceptance video. However, instead of posing in front of the Mona Lisa, the couple stood next to a portrait of the Duchess of Sussex. Pink took home the outstanding contribution to music award, before taking to the stage to perform a 10-minute medley of her greatest hits. After performing her new single, Walk Me Home, backstage, the star appeared in the roof of the O2 Arena, descending to the ground in a ring of fire, before playing Try in the middle of a screen of cascading water. She said in her acceptance speech: ""To be considered in the same category as David Bowie and The Beatles and Sir Elton and Sir Paul and Fleetwood Mac is beyond anything I can comprehend. ""It's been an awesome journey from busking... to playing Wembley Stadium this summer. It's really exciting! ""Thank you for having me here. it's been an awesome 20 years. Here's to 20 more."" The 1975 emerged as the night's big winners, thanks to their their outrageous, ambitious and confessional third album A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships. Singer Matty Healy, who last year caused controversy by claiming misogyny ""no longer existed in rock and roll"", used the acceptance speech for best group to modify his comments. ""Male misogynist acts are examined for nuance and defended as traits of 'difficult' artists, [while] women and those who call them out are treated as hysterics who don't understand art,"" he said, quoting a 2015 article by The Guardian's Laura Snapes, which gained renewed attention after allegations about US star Ryan Adams emerged last week. Analysis - Mark Savage, BBC Music Reporter Let's be honest, most of us have wondered whether award show winners get tipped off before the ceremony. Sometimes it seems painfully obvious: If you watched last week's Grammy Awards, you'll have seen Drake's name read out in the best rap song category - at which point a camera was conveniently positioned backstage to film the star, who had arrived, unannounced, to collect his award. Either the director was a clairvoyant, or someone had steamed open the envelope before the show. Tonight, digital channel UKTV Play confirmed what we've always suspected, by playing out a pre-taped advert for ""double Brit award winners"" The 1975, before the ceremony had even started. It's not clear whether the band had been made aware of what their marketing department knew - but it shone an awkward spotlight on every tearful ""this is so unexpected"" speech we've seen this awards season. That embarrassing mix-up aside, this was one of the slickest, most engaging Brit Awards in recent memory. All the performances hit home, from George Ezra's warm-hearted rendition of Shotgun to Pink's death-defying greatest hits medley (notable as much for the songs it left out as the ones it included). The only real let-down was the lack of major global talent. Pink aside, all the international winners - Ariana Grande, Drake and The Carters - were absent; their trophies handed out in a desultory video montage. Luckily for the Brits, this was more a case of bad luck than bad karma. Drake, who used his Grammy appearance to criticise the show's very existence, sent out positive vibes in his Brits' video message, wryly noting that, ""I very much look forward to attempting to win [best international male] many more times."" Maybe expanding the categories would help rectify the problem. The fact that there's still no award for best international album seems increasingly odd in a globalised streaming market. Change could easily be afoot. The Brits get a new chairman in 2020 and, with the Grammys still subject to an unofficial boycott by the likes of Kanye West and Childish Gambino, their first priority should be to lure that US talent to the UK.

"For every review calling it ""heart-stoppingly brilliant"", there is another dismissing it as ""tired to the point of lifelessness"". Metro's Tilly Pearce says the darkly comic thriller is ""as hilarious, gripping and extra as ever"". But Anita Singh of The Telegraph says ""the novelty has worn off"" and that it is ""no longer TV's must-watch"". Viewers can make up their own minds when the third season begins in the US on Sunday. The first episode will be made available on BBC iPlayer on Monday morning ahead of a BBC One airing on 19 April. Unlike previous seasons, the third series will not immediately be put online in its entirety. Instead, episodes will be released each Monday on a week-by-week basis. The following reviews contain some plot details of Killing Eve's third season. Based on Luke Jennings' Codename Villanelle novellas, Killing Eve tells of a sultry professional assassin and a dogged MI6 operative on her trail. The second season climaxed with Villanelle (Jodie Comer) apparently shooting Eve (Sandra Oh) in Rome. The third season begins with Eve in a thankless new job, having survived Villanelle's attempt on her life. Before long, however, a shocking death once again sets them on a collision course. According to the Mirror's Sara Wallis, the new season is ""fresh, funny and as fashion-conscious as ever"". Under new head writer Suzanne Heathcote, she continues, the show contains ""plenty of shocking deaths, new characters and jaw-dropping, creative murders"". Yet the Independent's Ed Cumming is less impressed, saying the show ""doesn't have much left to offer"" beyond Comer's ""watchable"" performance. ""Once fresh and thrilling, Killing Eve has grown stale and predictable,"" he writes in his two-star review. TV Guide's Kaitlin Thomas, meanwhile, says the show ""now feels like a copy of its former self"". ""The lack of creative dialogue and minor flourishes emphasises Season 3's familiarity and repetitiveness,"" writes IndieWire's Ben Travers. Flora Carr of the Radio Times believes the first episode of the third season ""suffers in comparison to the heights of season one"". Yet she remains ""hopeful"" that Heathcote ""spreads the fun a little more evenly"" in the instalments to follow. The Herald's Alison Rowat is also optimistic, believing Heathcote will fill the ""tall heels"" of her predecessors Phoebe Waller-Bridge and Emerald Fennell. Den of Geek's Delia Harrington, meanwhile, is happy to report that the show's ""eerie, off-kilter humour remains in place"". Dame Harriet Walter, Steve Pemberton and Gemma Whelan are among the new cast members joining series regulars Comer, Oh and Fiona Shaw. A fourth series has already been commissioned, with Sex Education's Laura Neal taking over as lead writer. Killing Eve is one of BBC iPlayer's most popular shows, with nearly 110 million requests lodged to view the first two series. Oh won a Golden Globe for her role last year, while both Comer and Shaw were honoured at 2019's Bafta TV Awards. Follow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

"Attacking The Devil: Harold Evans and the Last Nazi War Crime has been awarded the event's special jury prize. The film tells the story of Sir Harold's campaigns, including an investigation into the drug thalidomide, which left 10,000 babies with deformities in the 1950s and '60s. Juror and film-maker Dawn Porter praised its ""relevance and rigour"". Attacking The Devil was one of 130 films to be screened at the Sheffield event, one of the world's leading documentary festivals. It was directed by Jacqui Morris and her brother David, who also made the 2012 documentary McCullin about Sunday Times war photographer Don McCullin. As Sunday Times editor, Mr Evans campaigned for compensation for the victims of thalidomide before fighting a legal injunction to stop the paper revealing the drug's developers had not gone through the proper testing procedures. Jacqui Morris said: ""We're living in quite a transitional time with the press and the press are really under fire at the moment with the hacking scandals and everything that was highlighted by the Leveson Inquiry. ""I think what this [Thalidomide campaign] showed was the good the press can do and the importance of investigative journalism."" The film, which received its world premiere at the Sheffield festival, will have a cinema release in the autumn. 'Epic in scope' Dawn Porter said: ""We unanimously found this film to be an elegant examination of complex themes. ""We appreciated this film on all levels - it is a work approached with relevance and rigour, a historical film feels contemporary and engaging, blossoms like a novel, surprising when least expected. ""In a field of films remarkable for their quality, we found this film to be epic in scope traversing decades and exploring big themes while revealing intimate details. ""Attacking The Devil is a call to arms inviting us to examine our past as it celebrates and reminds us of the critical value of journalism."" The jury also gave an honourable mention to Night Will Fall, a film by director and producer Andre Singer looking at attempts to make a documentary about Nazi concentration camps after World War Two. Last year's special jury prize winner, The Act of Killing, which was also produced by Mr Singer, went on to win a Bafta and be named the best film of 2013 by The Guardian. This year's inspiration award was given to US film-maker Laura Poitras, who helped ex-CIA systems analyst Edward Snowden leak information about the US National Security Agency's (NSA) surveillance programme. She is now making a film about the NSA. But she did not attend the festival in person, instead sending a message saying she thought travelling to the UK ""is not safe for me right now because of my reporting on GCHQ and NSA.

"For more than 50 years, he asked his guests to speak without hesitation, repetition or deviation on topics as diverse as burglars, Birmingham and biscuits in bed. Each week, Parsons tried, sometimes unsuccessfully, to keep a bevy of celebrity panellists in check including Paul Merton, Derek Nimmo, Sheila Hancock and the show's undoubted scene-stealer, Kenneth Williams. Always neatly coiffed and invariably immaculate in blazer and flannels, Parsons' smooth tones on Just A Minute and, more particularly, his sugary image on Sale of the Century, made him a dapper reminder of a bygone age and a ripe target for other comedians. Christopher Nicholas Parsons was born on 10 October 1923 in Grantham, Lincolnshire, the son of a GP. His father's patients included the Thatcher family, although there is no definitive proof, as has been suggested, that Dr Parsons delivered the future prime minister. Nicholas Parsons described himself in his autobiography as ""the unconventional child of conventional parents"". His early schooling was hampered by dyslexia and the insistence of his teachers that he should write with his right hand, despite being born left-handed. He was also hampered by a stammer which he finally managed to overcome. He had early ambitions to be an actor but his parents opposed the idea, his mother believing show business was fit only for ""drunks and low-lifes"". Instead, a few strings were pulled through family contacts and he joined a shipbuilding company on Clydeside to train as an engineer. Thrown into a tough working environment, he was forced to resort to jokes and impersonations to win over the Glasgow shipbuilders who regarded him as a posh boy. The experience helped launch his show business career. Illness prevented him taking up an offer to join the merchant navy during the war but, by this time, he had begun taking small parts in local theatres around Glasgow where he also did impressions. Breakthrough Moving to London, he worked in repertory, cabaret, on the West End stage, and at the Windmill Theatre as a comic. He appeared in various radio shows including Much-Binding-in-the-Marsh. His big breakthrough came when he began working as a straight man for Arthur Haynes, whose ITV show had made him the most popular comedian in Britain. Parsons excelled as the authority figure in sketches during which Haynes, often in his normal role as a tramp, railed against the establishment. Many of the scripts were written by Johnny Speight, the creator of Till Death Us Do Part. He was so successful that Haynes began to perceive him as a threat and the pair parted company shortly after an appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show. In 1960, he voiced the character of Tex Tucker in the television puppet series, Four Feather Falls, produced by Gerry Anderson who would later go on to make Thunderbirds. Just A Minute first aired on 22 January 1967. Parsons had originally wanted to be a panellist but the BBC insisted his experience as a comedy straight man made him ideal for the position of chairman. ""As a good straight man,"" he once said, ""you know how to throw out the lines so the comic will have a good springboard to come back. You also know how to take a joke at your expense."" It remained one of the hallmarks of the show as Parsons, with varying degrees of success, dealt with panellists such as Kenneth Williams, whose treatment of his chairman ranged from toadying sycophancy to outright abuse. Later stars like Paul Merton and Stephen Fry kept the regular audience of two million listeners entertained while Parsons, who never missed a recording in the first five decades that he fronted the show, remained the butt of a series of gentle jokes. Sale of the Century made him one of Britain's most familiar faces. Announcer John Benson's ""And now from Norwich, it's the Quiz of the Week"" was the introduction to a show that originally ran for 12 years from 1971. With its glamorous ""shop assistants"" and the fixed grin of its host, the programme became one of the most successful television shows of its time, with up to 20 million people tuning in. Parsons robustly rejected suggestions that his appearance on the programme amounted to dumbing down. ""I'm proud of the fact I helped create a huge success,"" he said. ""You don't buck success."" However, he later admitted the programme had made his career take something of a dip because people assumed he was now just a quiz master. Parsons continued his straight man role when he joined The Benny Hill Show in 1969 where he remained for five years. Budding performers He later put himself at the mercy of Rik Mayall and Adrian Edmondson in The Comic Strip Presents, in which he appeared as himself. This willingness to share the joke, appearing on television programmes like Have I Got News for You, playing a vampire's victim in a 1989 episode of Doctor Who and narrating The Rocky Horror Show all helped him accrue a definite cult status, and a surprisingly youthful fan base. He was also successful away from the microphone. He set up his own production company that made short films for cinema, wrote two volumes of autobiography and made it into the Guinness Book of Records in 1978 for the longest ever after-dinner speech, more than 11 hours. He was also a regular at the Edinburgh Fringe where his Nicholas Parsons' Happy Hour featured his own stand-up routine and a series of guests, many of them budding performers encouraged by Parsons. However, his annual star turn at the Fringe was cancelled in 2019 after Parsons was admitted to hospital. He was due to perform four sold-out shows. It followed a rare no-show on Just A Minute with what the BBC said was a ""bad back"". It was only the second time he had missed a taping in the panel show's 52-year history. Parsons was fanatical about cricket, both as a player and supporter, and was a president of the Lord's Taverners. He also served as rector of the University of St Andrews and was a prominent supporter of the Liberal Democrats. He married the actress Denise Bryer in 1954. The couple divorced in 1989 and he subsequently married Ann Reynolds. He was once asked what drove him to continue working at an age when most people would have been happy to potter about in the garden. He said he did it because it was fun. ""You can't take yourself seriously. I learned that being a straight man. That's what I do on Just A Minute - laugh at myself and they make jokes at my expense.

Having fun.""","Nicholas Parsons' early acting experience as a comedy straight man made him ideal as the unflappable presenter of one of BBC Radio 4's longest-running programmes, Just A Minute."
"By Mark SavageBBC Music reporter Rising from Reading, the four-piece have been on an upwards trajectory for the last two years, gigging relentlessly around the UK in a tour van they call ""Big Suze"". ""We've taken her everywhere,"" says flame-haired singer and guitarist Matt Thomson. ""There's been a lot of throwing up in it. A lot of drunken nights. ""We've even shut our guitarist's hand in the door. He had to play the next show with two fingers."" But the decrepit Ford Transit van met a grisly end earlier this year, when the band set it on fire for the cover of their debut album. ""We thought, who are we and what do we do?"" says Thomson. ""We wanted to shoot the cover in Reading - to put our flag in the ground and say, 'We're a Reading band and we're not ashamed of it'. ""After that, it was just coming up with the wackiest thing we could think of, and that was setting the van on fire."" It's not just frivolous vandalism, though. It's a metaphor. ""Reading's a commuter town. It's quite a mundane town. It's the kind of place that people want to get away from. We want to celebrate it, but we also started a band to go on an adventure and leave it. I think that's what we're conveying in our album artwork."" Behind the artwork, the album rattles with power chord anthems, from the full-pelt rock of Stay With Me to the boisterous bluster of Black Magic. Speaking to BBC News ahead of the its release on 26 May, Thomson shared some of the best stories from the band's first three years. They used their connections at Waitrose to build an audience ""If stacking shelves doesn't make you want to be a rock star, nothing will,"" laughs Thomson, who worked at his local branch of Waitrose during the band's early days. However, showing entrepreneurial skills that would make Alan Sugar sweat biscuits, he used his position to win The Amazons a few new fans. ""My job, personally, was about online shopping. So I'd go through someone's list, picking out the shopping, putting it in baskets, and then I would slip our little demo CD into there. ""We didn't know how to get our name out there. If no-one's playing you on the radio, then you just do what you have to do. ""So who knows? We might have a fan base of old grannies in Pangbourne."" They've played some terrible gigs ""Dunfermline,"" says Thomson decisively, when asked to recall the band's worst gig. ""Weird town. They have a park that's absolutely jam-packed full of squirrels and they'll come up to you and take crisps from you. Never seen anything like it in my life. ""Anyway, we played at about one in the morning and it was deserted, except for this old Scottish couple who were slow-dancing. I don't know what their internal mind music was, but they were not hearing us."" The band have also experienced several stage invasions over the last year... much to their disgust. ""It's quite irritating, actually, if I'm honest,"" says the singer. ""They all trample on your gear and stand on the effects pedals. Everything gets cut off and you can't finish your goddamn song! ""And people are well up for stealing stuff. ""After gigs, we'll be taking pictures with people, and they'll ask me to sign a drum stick. I'll say, 'Did Joe [Emmett, drummer] give you this?' And they say, 'Not really, no!' They just go into his bag and take them. Unbelievable."" They're 'on a mission to reinvigorate rock and roll' At least, that's what their press release says. ""Listen, I don't write the press releases,"" cringes Thomson. ""I don't think rock necessarily needs to be reinvigorated [but] it's become more of a niche thing than 10 years ago, when you had bands like the Arctic Monkeys in the charts. ""But we love rock and roll, whether it's cool or not, and that's the music that we make."" Matt Thomson is not a good boyfriend The most excoriating song on The Amazons' debut album is In My Mind - in which Thomson describes letting a relationship fester long after he'd broken up with his girlfriend in his mind. ""Don't have the strength to carry on,"" he sings over pummelling guitars. ""Don't have the guts to let you know what's going on."" Initially, he considered changing the lyrics to spare his ex's feelings, ""but I wouldn't have been able to live with myself if I'd dumbed it down"". In the end, though, his candour came back to bite him. ""There are about two or three different girls who've said they think it's about them, which is terrible. It does not paint a good picture of me. And you know what? Maybe they all have a case."" The Amazons have a lot of lyrics about being alone On Stay With Me, Thomson sings, ""there's nothing wrong with being alone"". On Junk Food Forever, it's ""I don't want to be alone"". And on In My Mind, he opines, ""I'm better off being alone"". So which is it? ""Amazing question!"" he laughs. ""I do think about being alone a lot; and I change my mind about it constantly."" Junk Food Forever is the most accurate depiction of his feelings, he reckons. ""When I wrote it, the band was going nowhere, all my friends were going to uni and I was stuck in Reading. I realised I don't like being alone. I love being surrounded by people and seeing friends. ""You know how Bob Marley had a big mansion and all his friends and family lived there? That would be my dream."" They're going to stalk Lana Del Rey at Radio 1's Big Weekend ""I'm very excited about Big Weekend,"" enthuses Thomson. ""I looked at the line-up and we're easily the smallest act. It's glorious. ""We are playing at midday. And I am very up for just putting the gear back in the van, getting the beers and seeing all the other acts."" Top of his list is Lana Del Rey, who plays after them on Saturday night. ""I love Lana Del Rey. I love her, let's just put it that way. But there is no way I'll be able to get near her. She'll have 12 huge guys around her... Mind you, she has insane fans, who probably are dangerous, so that kind of makes sense. ""But just to be in the same room would be amazing."" Their album was finished a year ago Seriously. The band went into the studio with producer Catherine Marks (The Killers, Wolf Alice, PJ Harvey) last April but decided to sit on the record. In the meantime, the band were tipped by influential polls like MTV Brand New and the BBC's Sound of 2017, and booked to play on Later... With Jools Holland. ""I've read interviews where bands have been sitting on albums for a while and they've all said it's terrible but I've not really minded that much,"" says Thomson. ""I think if we'd got all that attention and the album wasn't ready, there'd have been a lot of pressure, so I'm thankful we did it under the radar and made the album we wanted to make.

"The annual award is Bafta's highest accolade and was bestowed to actor Christopher Lee last year. Bafta chair Tim Corrie called Scorsese ""a legend in his lifetime, a true inspiration to all young directors"". The film-maker will collect his accolade at the Bafta Awards in London on 12 February. Scorsese, whose latest movie Hugo has been applauded by the critics, said: ""It is a great honour to be recognized by the British Academy and to join the ranks of such an esteemed group of industry colleagues and friends."" Previous recipients from the discipline of film-making to gain the award include Steven Spielberg, Alfred Hitchcock and Stanley Kubrick. Scorsese's film career spans six decades, with work including Taxi Driver, Gangs of New York and The Aviator. He has picked up nine Bafta nominations for directing, winning in 1991 for Goodfellas. The film-maker, 69, picked up a string of Oscar nods during a long wait to finally win best director for The Departed in 2007. In 1990,he founded The Film Foundation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to film preservation. Previous honorary accolades for his life's work have included a Cesar in France, a life achievement from the American Film Institute in 1997 and recognition from the Director's Guild of America in 2003. Scorsese's most recent film Hugo marks his first foray into 3D movie-making in the family film genre.",Director Martin Scorsese is to be honoured with the British Academy fellowship at the Bafta Film Awards ceremony next month.
"Boyce will fly the flag with a major new exhibition at the world's most important contemporary art festival. She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the offer came as ""a real shock, but a real delight as well"". The London-based artist rose to prominence in the 1980s as one of the leading lights in black British art. Her art has often dealt with themes of race and gender, initially working with pastels and then moving into photography, video, sound and installations. ""That early work in the 1980s was very much about me being the centre of a lot of those images that I was making, and I would often talk about growing up in the UK, being black and being female, and what it was like at that particular time,"" she told Today. ""And the work has since shifted, which I suppose is what we're going to be seeing when the show goes to Venice."" Boyce was made an MBE in 2007 and was elected to the Royal Academy in 2016. She is also currently creating a large artwork for the new Elizabeth Line railway in Newham, east London. For her latest exhibition, at Eastside Projects in Birmingham, titled In the Castle of My Skin, she has built what she described as a ""crazy structure"" in the gallery to show her wallpapers and the work of seven artists with whom she has collaborated. Emma Dexter, director of visual art for the British Council, said the committee had chosen Boyce at ""a pivotal moment in in the history of the UK"". She said: ""They really loved the fact that Sonia brings people together. Her practice is very collaborative. It's very open-ended, experimental, and values people working together and appreciating their difference but still coming together.""

"The five-part series has received 3m requests on the catch-up service, more than the England v Wales match at Euro 2016 - which had 2.8m requests. Seven of the 20 most popular iPlayer programmes were on BBC Three, which moved online earlier this year. Murdered By My Father and the first episode of Greg Davies comedy Cuckoo each received more than 1.5m requests. Other shows to pass the 1m request mark in 2016 included Fleabag, Life And Death Row, The Insider with Reggie Yates and Stacey Dooley documentary Sex In Strange Places. 'Encouraging signs' BBC Three's iPlayer popularity comes in spite of it now offering fewer programmes. When it became an online service in February, many shows - such as Don't Tell The Bride and Family Guy - were bought by other networks. But the network continued to produce original programming for iPlayer and its other online services, including a bespoke YouTube channel. Speaking about the latest figures, BBC Three controller Damian Kavanagh said: ""These are still early days for BBC Three and I'm incredibly proud of what we have achieved in such a short space of time."" ""Reinventing the BBC's offer for young people won't happen overnight, it's a marathon not a sprint, but the early signs are very encouraging."" As part of BBC Three's move online, the channel committed to spending 20% of its £30m budget on non-TV content including written articles, animations and social media content, in an attempt to attract younger audiences. The BBC Trust, which approved the move, said there was ""clear public value in moving BBC Three online, as independent evidence shows younger audiences are watching more online and watching less linear TV"". However, commercial rivals claim that the amount of time young viewers consuming BBC content has fallen since BBC Three ceased broadcasting on television. Thinkbox TV, whose shareholders include Sky, ITV and Channel 4, published a report on Monday suggesting commercial TV viewing by young people increased after BBC Three went online. ITV2, which broadcasts a considerable number of youth-focused programmes such as Love Island, Family Guy and Celebrity Juice, saw an increase of 27% year-on-year in time viewers spent watching the channel between March and June.

"The dystopian murder mystery made an estimated $160,000 (£125,000) over the weekend after opening in 613 cinemas. That's the worst opening for a ""wide"" release since a little-known 2008 film called Proud American made just $96,000 (£75,000) in its opening weekend. London Fields has been the subject of protracted litigation since 2015. The film was to have had its premiere at that year's Toronto Film Festival but was pulled from the schedule after its director sued its producers. Director Mathew Cullen claimed Christopher Hanley and Jordan Gertner had added ""incendiary imagery"" to the film without his approval. Hanley and Gertner later counter-sued Cullen, accusing him of breaching his contract. The producers also launched a legal action against Heard, claiming she ""participated in a concerted campaign of disinformation"" to ""damage"" the film. Heard launched her own counter-suit, alleging the producers violated a no-nudity clause in her contract by secretly filming sex scenes with a body double. The Aquaman actress reached a settlement with the producers last month that allowed London Fields to be released on 26 October. Based on Amis's 1989 novel, London Fields tells of a clairvoyant named Nicola Six who divines she is to be murdered by one of her two suitors. Depp, to whom Heard was married at the time of shooting, has a cameo as a gangster in the film, which currently has a 0% rating on reviews aggregator Rotten Tomatoes. The New York Times described the film as ""a trashy, tortured misfire,"" while the Los Angeles Times called it ""aggressively awful"". Heard, whose divorce from Depp was finalised last year, was pictured last week next to a London taxi cab at the film's Los Angeles premiere. London Fields' belated release was complicated by the fact that two different versions were released on the same day. The film's distributor, GVN Releasing, supplemented the film's wide release by showing a ""director's cut"" in 13 ""select cinemas"". Mathew Cullen praised the company ""for thinking outside the box"" by facilitating what he said might be ""a cinematic first"". No UK release date has been confirmed for London Fields, which has only been seen outside the US in Russia, Lithuania and Estonia. Proud American is a biographical drama whose subjects included the founders of Coca-Cola and Wal-Mart, both of whom invested in the film.

"By Ian YoungsEntertainment & arts reporter This may sound like a pretty typical TripAdvisor review. But if you stay in the hotel bedroom created by Christopher Samuel, don't rush to post a scathing review. He has actually designed it to be as annoying as possible (while remaining just about habitable). ""You probably wouldn't spend more than a night in it in reality,"" says Michael Trainor, creative director of the Art B&B in Blackpool. ""I think the novelty would soon wear off."" Samuel is one of 19 artists who have kitted out a room in the seaside B&B. And it's hard not to chuckle at the fiendishness of Samuel's adaptations every time you spot another deliberately awkward feature (the upside-down shower gel dispenser is a particular triumph of user-unfriendliness). But for him, it's not a joke. By making life difficult for visitors, the artist wants to give them a taste of the access problems faced by many disabled people. ""I knew people would find it amusing at first, but in reality when you live that every day it's not funny any more,"" he says. ""It's inconvenient, it's frustrating, it's humiliating at times."" In 2017, Leicester-based Samuel, who uses an electric wheelchair, was forced to live in an inaccessible hotel room as emergency accommodation for three months. 'It's real' ""I was technically made homeless by two local councils, who were arguing over my care costs and access needs,"" he explains. ""I couldn't move around the room freely. It was very tight. For me to get in the door, I had to go into a little corner, then I had to shut the door behind me and I had to reverse out and navigate around the bed. ""I couldn't sit at the table. I had to sleep in my wheelchair - I couldn't use the bed. I couldn't shut the bathroom door. I couldn't use the toilet. I had to use a bucket. I couldn't wash because there was a shower [which wasn't accessible]."" He doesn't mind if the deliberately inaccessible room he has now designed raises a smile at first. ""On the surface level it's quite playful and theatrical,"" he says. ""But it's real. ""Why should I be upset if someone has not experienced what I've experienced? The whole point is for that conversation to be had, and for people to think about it."" In his room - titled Welcome Inn - the bed is surrounded by a 3ft lip, which you must scramble over every time you want to get in or out. The bathroom door doesn't close because it hits the toilet, meaning there's no privacy. There's a particularly ingenious arrangement for watching TV, and other tricks are likely to leave you exasperated if you want to use basic things like the bedside lights, shelf or table. ""Anyone with wheelchairs will know that when we go to places that have tables and chairs, a lot of the time you can't get under them, or they'll be too high, or there's a bar in the middle of the table so you have to position yourself to the side,"" Samuel says. ""It's little things like that."" Before designing the room, Samuel made a series of artworks titled Housing Crisis, comprising heavily redacted images of some of the 500 emails that went between him, the councils and a solicitor. One example on his website shows a long email with everything except the words ""softly spoken"" and ""dignity"" blanked out. As well as giving non-disabled people an uncomfortable stay, the artist wants his room to make a bigger point. ""The work is about a wider issue due to austerity and the fact that there's a housing crisis, there's cuts being made to councils,"" he says. ""The people who are suffering most are the most vulnerable - the disabled and the elderly, who are being pushed out of society."" When he was forced into hotel accommodation, there were ""so many insane suggestions"", he says, such as: ""That I should go into a care home, or I should wear an incontinence pad when I'm not incontinent. This is all due to cuts."" The hotel room was commissioned by Unlimited, an arts organisation that supports work by disabled artists, and Art B&B, which has opened as an alternative to the traditional B&Bs on Blackpool seafront. Samuel hasn't seen his room - because he can't get to it. ""I think it's brilliant,"" he says, breaking into hysterics. ""It's perfect, this commission was perfect for me."" Elsewhere in the Art B&B, the accommodation ranges from rooms with overhead light installations, neon slogans and meditative soundscapes, to those with murals and displays inspired by the town's architecture, faded glamour and history. In one, by Noah Rose, there are peepshow-style viewers hidden under the bed, in the wardrobe and in the bathroom cabinet. Rather than letting you see into the next room, however, they actually show curious photos, postcards and advertisements from Blackpool's bygone age. The B&B idea originated from Leftcoast, an organisation that uses the arts to try to improve life in the Blackpool area. It wanted to find ways to make art pay for itself - so, given that tourism is big business, it came up with the idea of combining a gallery and a hotel. The venue will run events and tours for locals, and is trying to appeal to ""cultural tourists"" who may not be keen on the typical accommodation the town has to offer, Trainor says. ""The traditional B&B accommodation isn't what people want these days. Or it isn't what people who are used to travelling the world and having snazzy city breaks want anyway. ""So we're trying to fill that gap in the market in a slightly quirky way."" Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

"By Neil SmithEntertainment reporter, BBC News Oscar-winning actress Dame Judi Dench and opera star Bryn Terfel were among the performers at the event, held at London's Royal Albert Hall. The concert featured numbers from Sondheim musicals such as Sweeney Todd, Into the Woods, Company and Follies. Earlier the veteran composer said it was ""exhilarating"" to be honoured. ""There's very little as thrilling as a full orchestra in a reverberant hall,"" he told the BBC's Petroc Trelawny at a pre-concert question and answer session. Broadcast live on BBC Radio 3 and shown later on BBC Two, the concert saw Dame Judi sing Send In The Clowns from A Little Night Music. The 75-year-old later returned for the closing number, a rousing rendition of Side By Side By Side from Company performed by the ensemble with the BBC Concert Orchestra. Terfel performed a medley of numbers from Sweeney Todd, recently filmed by Tim Burton with Johnny Depp. The Welsh bass-baritone delighted onlookers later by taking part in a comic song from A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum. West End stars Maria Friedman, Jenna Russell, Julian Ovenden and Simon Russell Beale also participated in the event, the first Prom to be signed for deaf concert-goers. Queues for returns and day seats snaked along the surrounding streets prior to the concert, though not every seat was filled inside the Hall. Sondheim, who took a tiny stumble as he made his way to the stage, was visibly moved as he embraced Dame Judi, Friedman and conductor David Charles Abell. Among the other performers were beneficiaries of the BBC Performing Arts Fund, a charity funded by proceeds from public phone voting on such BBC One shows as Over the Rainbow and I'll Do Anything. Since making his Broadway debut in 1957 as the writer of West Side Story's lyrics, Sondheim has become one of the most popular and revered figures in musical theatre.

"The panellist has reignited the show's gender pay debate, after it was previously revealed Ballas was paid less than her predecessor, Len Goodman. Horwood told The Sun that Ballas's contribution to the show was not ""comparable"" to Goodman's. Former judge Arlene Phillips agreed, saying: ""I do think experience counts."" Ballas took on the role last year and her salary has not been revealed. Her agent told the BBC she would be making no comment. Goodman - who has now left the show - and fellow judge Bruno Tonioli were both in the £200,000-£250,000 bracket when the pay of BBC stars' earning more than £150,000 a year was revealed last year. The show's other judges, Craig Revel Horwood and Darcey Bussell, got between £150,000 and £200,000. Discussing the equal pay debate, Horwood said: ""I think women should be paid the same as men. That's for sure. ""But what would you say to a woman coming in after you've been in the job for 15 years when they've done absolutely nothing to earn it? I don't think that's right."" Addressing Ballas' case directly, he said: ""You'd expect she would start on something lower because she's never been on TV before, the show's been going for 14 years. ""Len Goodman earned a major reputation and put the show on the map like we all did. We all created it from the beginning. And I don't think it's comparable. ""Sorry. It just isn't."" Speaking on Tuesday morning's Lorraine, former Strictly judge Phillips backed Horwood's comments, expressing support for equal pay ""but also for experience"". The 75-year-old dance choreographer called on Strictly to implement the same policy as West End shows, where pay is increased ""every year for the experience you've had"". ""Craig has been there for a long time and I think he deserves every penny,"" she said.

Henry Cavill does his own stunts It wasn't just Amazon shows that people were willing to queue for. Netflix production The Witcher had hundreds of people waiting in line to see Henry Cavill discuss his new role as Geralt of Rivia, the monster hunter. The fantasy adaptation is based on Anrzej Sapkowski's novels and subsequent video games. The actor revealed he fought hard to be cast in the role as he is a fan of the games. ""He's not your average hero... he won't treat everyone perfectly and at the same time he's a real hero, but he keeps that very secret and very private,"" Cavill told the panel. He also revealed how he did all his own stunts for the show and had to get used to the weight of the sword. You may also like Godzilla makes his San Diego debut It's hard to believe but Godzilla has never appeared officially at San Diego Comic Con until this weekend. Hundreds of people stood in line to see original props and exclusive art work from Godzilla films over the past 65 years. Fans also wanted the chance to take a picture with one of the original Godzillas. The rubber costume was worn by an actor in Godzilla 2000 before CGI technology brought a more realistic beast to the big screen. Chris Mowry, the brand creative manager for the exhibit, said: ""I don't know why it took us so long to come here but we are here now. I never doubted it would be a success."" Spiderman is the most popular cosplay If there is one thing synonymous with Comic Con it's cosplay. Dressing up in costumes based on beloved film, TV or video game characters is part of the comic con experience. San Diego Comic Con will attract 130,000 people this weekend so there is no shortage of costumes on display - ranging from simple home made ones to more elaborate designs. This year Spiderman appears to be the costume of choice for many including 48-year-old Terence Thompson. He says he likes to cosplay at the weekend when he's not working as a nurse in San Diego. Other popular costumes so far include Marvel characters and stormtroopers. Dafne Keen is a fan of Harry Potter Remember the girl who appeared with Hugh Jackman in the 2107 blockbuster hit film Logan? Fourteen-year-old Dafne Keen was spotted at the Harry Potter and the Cursed Child exhibit. Now a few years older she told the BBC she hadn't been recognised by too many people probably because she was ""incognito"", wearing a mask - which she kindly removed for this picture. Comic Books are still going strong With big budget productions, merchandise and Hollywood star panels its hard to believe the humble comic book is still as popular now than it was 50 years ago when comic con started in the basement of a hotel in San Diego. Reuben Miranda has been selling comics for 18 years and says they're more popular than ever because of the Hollywood adaptations. ""It's great that there are so many new fans but I am doing a lot of explaining. ""Because many don't know the basics, like how they're numbered, the order of the collections, stuff like that, but I really don't mind."" he said. Reuben says his comics can cost from between $3 and thousands of dollars, and business is better than ever. Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

"He will also perform at the ceremony which celebrates the cream of UK folk music over the last 12 months. Now in its 12th year, the award show will be co-hosted by Radio 2 presenter Mike Harding and singer Barbara Dickson, from The Brewery in London. For the first time, the event will be broadcast live on the network. It will follow a special edition of Simon Mayo's drivetime programme, which will also be broadcast live from the same venue. Bellowhead, who are set to perform on the night, are leading the way with four nominations, following the release of their album, Hedonism, earlier this year. The record was recorded at the iconic Abbey Road studios and produced by John Leckie. They are up for best group, live act, best album and traditional track for New York Girls. Nominees Frontman Jon Boden has also made the shortlist for folk singer of the year and will compete against Chris Wood. The musician is also up for best album for Handmade Life and original song for his ballad Hollow Point. Mother and daughter team Norma Waterson and Eliza Carthy have been nominated three times and trio Coope Boyes and Simpson pick up nominations for best group and best album for As If. This year, for the first time, The Folk Awards and The Young Folk Award, which is Radio 2's annual search for the most promising young artist in the UK, are being combined. The four nominees were selected by a panel of judges following a semi-final weekend of workshops and performance in November. The Levellers, Kate Rusby and Chris Wood will all perform on the night, along with co-host Barbara Dickson.","Singer-songwriter Donovan will receive the lifetime achievement award at the Radio 2 Folk Awards in February, it has been announced."
"Will GompertzArts editor@WillGompertzBBCon Twitter It won't be the contents that rattles their collective cage, which is exactly what you'd expect from the Turner Prize-winning potter, but the way it has been displayed. Or, more specifically, the shortcomings of the first room of the show. It is tiny. Put a dozen or so people in there and it will feel more like a game of sardines than an art reconnaissance trip. One minute you'll be admiring a large photograph of a young, naked Grayson covered in paint, the next Mrs Stockbridge from The Crescent will be squeezing past his decorated member apologising for the coarseness of her tweed suit. You can't avoid it. The first room, that is. The exhibition is hung chronologically and most people like to start at the beginning. The good folk at the museum will have to figure out how to manage visitor flow (there's a secret door that could come into play) because the space isn't just very small, it is also full of objects and you stay in there for three films that collectively last over an hour. This is where we first meet the recently graduated Grayson who, we discover, is on the hunt for his artistic voice. He's not short of things to say - he's never short of things to say - but is yet to find the medium through which to communicate. He is living in a north London squat and hanging out with a bohemian crowd, including a pre-pop star Boy George, and, on occasion, Derek Jarman, the avant-garde film-maker and elder statesman. Perry starts by making films, which have not aged well. He dabbles in performance art, and then accepts an invitation from his girlfriend's sister to come along to her pottery night class. And that is where this show begins, with a small brown plate called Kinky Sex (1983), which he produced a few weeks after starting the course. It is not very good, either technically or artistically, but it is distinctly Grayson Perry in tone and aesthetic. The plate shows two heads in profile either side of a long-haired, crucified central figure welded to the plate by a melted coin over his or her privates (sexes are ambiguous). It is, like all his work, fantastical and pointed, realised with a drawn line that is as distinctive as his throaty cackle. There is a Hieronymus Bosch-like detail in these early bits and pieces, mischievous layers of words, picture and material that subvert the medium and the apparent naivety of the image. Essex Plate (1985), for example, gives us a nice traditional coastal landscape with a boat bobbing around under a warming sun. It's Turneresque, almost. Until you see the black clouds gathered over the heads of the outlined faces and read the words printed on the rim: ""LA LA LA LA HARMONY PEACE AND LOVE THE NON MAGICK OF MEN WILL KILL US ALL."" Grayson wears his heart on his work. He reveals his frustrations as well as his fetishes in pieces such as Self Portrait Cracked and Warped (1985), in which we see his likeness served upside down on a plate. It is a sarcastic homage to the German expressionist painter Georg Baselitz, who Perry resentfully saw as a ""macho"" artist with global recognition working in a respected medium, while he struggled in obscurity making pots often perceived by a sniffy art world as lowly craft objects. Baselitz was selling his work for huge sums, Grayson was selling his for a few quid. But he was selling, as this show attests. Maybe it was only for £40 here and £50 there, but it was enough to stop him opting for career Plan B, which was to become a copywriter in an ad agency. And for that, we should be grateful. I'm sure the witty Mr Perry would have been a big success at Saatchi & Saatchi or wherever he ended up, but the world would have been a poorer place without his pagan pots and confessional plates, on which he smuggled what were then outre ideas and opinions about gender, sex, class, and taste. All art is autobiographical, but Perry's is specifically so, in much the same way as that of his fellow contemporary British artist Tracey Emin, who also uses craft materials to tell her story. The upshot of that means this show is more than a retrospective of his early works. It's also a diary of a young transvestite artist honing his talent and finding his way in the highly competitive art world of the late 1980s and early '90s when the YBAs (Young British Artists) ruled the roost. There is a rawness to his art, which goes beyond what he describes as technical ""ineptitude"", and leans towards a punk-influenced anger and distaste for establishment conventions. Can you imagine Bernard Leach, the father of modern British pottery, approving of Untitled (1988)? It is an oval, glazed terracotta plate with a cream background, on which we see a tableau consisting of a bemused transvestite with a shopping trolley surrounded by a variety of images from flowers on one side to a sinister wedding on the other. It is testament to the formative influence of outsider art on Perry, who was struck by the honesty and directness of the images produced by the untrained and often mentally disturbed. Four years later he's riffing on Japanese teaware from the Edo period in a vase called Western Art in the Form of a Saki Bottle (1992). Here he plays the ultimate post-modernist, referencing not only Asian culture, but also Pop Art, surrealism, modernism, northern European gothic and Hogarth's English satire - all wrapped up in sincere love for a William Morris-like commitment to craftsmanship. If you're not a Grayson Perry fan, this show isn't going to convert you. But if you are, like me, then it's well worth taking your chances with Mrs Stockbridge in Room 1. Recent reviews by Will Gompertz Follow Will Gompertz on Twitter","The Holburne Museum in Bath will have a nightmare on its hands if its exhibition Grayson Perry: The Pre-Therapy Years is even remotely successful.

"Renee Zellweger won best actress for playing Judy Garland in Judy. Joaquin Phoenix was named best actor for Joker. Brad Pitt and Laura Dern scooped the supporting acting awards for their roles in Once Upon A Time in Hollywood and Marriage Story respectively. Parasite won four awards in total, while Sir Sam Mendes's 1917 took three. The World War One epic had been the favourite to win best picture, but its awards all came in the technical categories. Parasite in paradise Parasite's Bong Joon-ho beat Sir Sam to the prize for best director, and also took the best original screenplay award. The film is a vicious social satire about two families from different classes in Seoul - one who live in poverty in a semi-basement, and another rich family residing in a large home. It has now managed what no other subtitled film has done in the 92-year history of the Academy Awards and won best picture. ""I feel like I'll wake up to find it's all a dream. It all feels very surreal,"" Bong said. Producer Kwak Sin-ae, who collected the trophy, said: ""I'm speechless. We never imagined this to happen. I feel like a very opportune moment in history is happening right now."" There were boos when organisers tried to cut short the best picture acceptance speech by turning the stage lights off - leading the lights to be turned back on, allowing the celebrations to continue. Brad Pitt gets political Pitt won the first acting Oscar of his career - picking up the best supporting actor trophy for his role in Quentin Tarantino's film. He was the first winner of the night, and immediately used his speech to attack the way the impeachment proceedings against US President Donald Trump were handled. He referred to the fact that Republican senators voted against allowing witnesses including former National Security Adviser John Bolton to give evidence. ""They told me I only have 45 seconds up here, which is 45 seconds more than the Senate gave John Bolton this week,"" he said. ""I'm thinking maybe Quentin does a movie about it and in the end the adults do the right thing."" The 56-year-old moved from the political to the personal, paying tribute to co-star Leonardo DiCaprio and reflecting on his journey to Hollywood superstardom. ""I'm a bit gobsmacked,"" he said, getting emotional. ""I'm not one to look back, but this has made me do so."" Joaquin Phoenix: 'I've been a scoundrel' Phoenix, who won best actor for his remarkable performance in the origin story about Batman's nemesis, also used the podium to send a heartfelt message about the state of the world, saying actors have the power to give a ""voice for the voiceless"". After telling the audience to stop clapping him as he took to the stage - ""Don't do that"" - he managed to cover topics from animal rights and the environment to racism and sexism. The vegan activist told the audience that ""we feel entitled to artificially inseminate a cow, and when she gives birth, we steal her baby even though her cries of anguish are unmistakable"". He also pointed out his own flaws: ""I've been a scoundrel in my life. I've been cruel at times and hard to work with, but so many people in this room have given me a second chance."" He ended his speech by quoting a lyric written by his late brother River: ""Run to the rescue and love and peace will follow."" The biggest winners Laura Dern's 'best birthday present ever' A day before her 53rd birthday, Laura Dern won best supporting actress for playing a divorce lawyer in Marriage Story. She comes from an illustrious acting family, but in winning managed something her parents have not. Mother Diane Ladd has been nominated for three Academy Awards, and dad Bruce Dern has two unsuccessful nominations. ""Some say never meet your heroes,"" their daughter told the audience. ""But I say if you're really blessed, you get them as your parents."" Meanwhile, Zellweger used her speech to pay tribute to Garland, who was nominated for two Oscars in the 1950s and 60s. ""Judy Garland did not receive this honour in her time,"" the actress said. ""I am certain that this moment is an extension of the celebration of her legacy."" The British winners Other notable winners And some notable omissions No host (but two hosts) For the second year, the ceremony had no host. It all started with an incendiary performance by singer and Moonlight actress Janelle Monae. ""We are celebrating all the women who directed phenomenal films,"" she said. ""I'm proud to be here as a black queer woman."" Then Steve Martin and Chris Rock appeared to deliver the traditional opening monologue as a double act. ""We both have hosted the Oscars before. And this is such an incredible demotion,"" Martin quipped. He remarked: ""Think how much the Oscars have changed in the past 92 years. Back in 1929 there were no black acting nominees.""

"Alison Feeney-Hart met the man whose 2007 film Michael Clayton saw him receive Bafta and Oscar nominations for best original screenplay to find out his Top 10 tips for writing a Hollywood blockbuster. 1. Go to the movies I don't think there is anything you can learn from courses or books. You have been watching movies since you were born. You have filled your life with narrative… and food. It's already way down deep inside you. Going to the movies, having something to say, having an imagination and the ambition to do it is really all that is required. You can learn how to do anything. This is imaginative work - screenwriters make things up. Everything I have in my life is a result of making things up. There is one thing that you have to know that is a deal-breaker - human behaviour. The quality of your writing will be directly related to your understanding of human behaviour. You need to become a journalist for the movie that is in your head. You need to report on it; every scene has to be real. Big ideas don't work. Start with a very small idea that you can build on. With Bourne I never read any of the books; we started again. The very smallest thing with [Jason] Bourne was, ""If I don't know who I am and I don't know where I'm from, perhaps I can identify who I am by what I know how to do."" We built a whole new world around that small idea. You just start small, you build out and you move one step after the next and that's how you write a Hollywood movie. My father was a screenwriter but it's not some pixie dust creative family thing. I learned from watching how hard he worked and learned about the tempo of a writer's life - you have to live by your wits. If you are living with someone who lives by their wits, it seems normal to you, it doesn't scare you as much and you understand the rhythms of it. It's getting harder and harder to make good movies. TV is where the ambiguity and shades of reality live, it's where stories can be interesting. A lot of writers are very excited about TV right now and it's a writer-controlled business. When writers are in control, good things happen. They are more rational, they are hardworking, they are more benevolent. Every time writers have been put in charge of entertainment, things have worked out, so with TV maybe we will see a writer-driven utopia. I have an office at home, I've written in a million hotel rooms, I can write anywhere now. My whole goal is to want to be at my desk. If the writing is going well, I don't want to quit. I'm older and wise enough now that if something is going well, I don't stop. I call and say I'm not coming home for dinner and just keep going. More than anything else, I want to want to go to my desk and to not be afraid of going to work. I spent six years tending bar while I figured out how to write screenplays. If you want to write, if you are a young writer and nobody knows you, find a job that pays you the most amount of money for the least amount of hours, so that you have the most amount of time left over to write. You want to live some place where you have some sort of cultural connection and can see as many films and be around as many people as possible. You want to be some place where you can just write and write and write. If you don't have anything to say and if you haven't done anything except see a bunch of movies, then what's the point? You can only write what you know about and that will either limit you or open the possibilities to everything. Be interested in lots of things and stay interested. My knowledge is very wide and incredibly thin. It's much more interesting when journalists and cops and doctors and bankers become screenwriters than 20-year-old film students. There are some exceptions, of course, but if you don't have anything to say, then why are you here? I don't think there is any reason to live there, I think LA is probably very bad for you. It's a bad place to feed your head. In LA you are driving around all the time, surrounded by people who are making you depressed. I don't think Hollywood really helps a young writer feel any sense of romance about their life. Even if it's a delusion, you want to feel special when you go to work in the morning. I have assumed both positions of the Hollywood Kama Sutra - top and bottom. It's very important to be able to handle rejection. I think one of the reasons writers are shy is because we are all very suspicious of our own process because it fails so often. It's no different from being a novelist or a composer or a painter. When you get rejection from the outside world, you either move on or you don't. But I think the hardest times are all the days when nothing happens and everybody who has ever written anything knows what I'm talking about. A great day of writing tops everything.

"By Kev GeogheganArts and entertainment reporter, BBC News The new record by Paolo Nutini is the music equivalent of the pick 'n' mix counter of a famous and sadly now defunct high street shop. In no particular order Caustic Love takes an almost exhausting jaunt around the worlds of classic 60s soul, funk, country-blues, hip-hop, electronica, 90s neo-soul, psychedelia and folk. Acoustic tracks jostle for space with short sampled musical interludes in the vein of artists like DJ Format, David Holmes or 2ManyDJs. ""It's interesting because I've heard this a few times,"" he says. ""But for me the last album that we made was far more schizophrenic in that sense, we were moving from ska... ish tracks to an accordion and fiddle song to a Dixieland theme. ""But this one retains an atmosphere and there's more of a common thread running through it than the last one. 'Like watching a movie' Keen to demonstrate his point, Nutini pulls out his smartphone and starts scrolling through one of his random music playlists. ""I'll read it out to you... it goes from Andrea Bocelli to Chet Baker to Alice Cooper to Allen Toussaint to Arcade Fire to Arthur Brown to the Au Go-Go Singers to Baby Huey. ""So the mix of music has never been a problem for me but with this, I felt it was important to feel like I was watching a movie, and [the music represents] different scenes in the movie."" Caustic Love is Nutini's first record since 2009's relentlessly cheerful Sunny Side Up, his five-times platinum-selling number one album and follow up to These Streets. The singer is speaking in his dressing room at the Royal Albert Hall, ahead of his headlining show for the Teenage Cancer Trust. It is one of the most prestigious venues in the UK and Nutini is pleased to be back. ""We've played here twice now, it's like a home from home,"" he jokes. ""It doesn't get any less prestigious, you get that same feeling if you're playing at the BBC Maida Vale studios, you see all that history on the walls. It's a great place and it's great to be involved. The venue has been hosting gigs to raise money for the charity since 2000 and has seen such stars on the line-up as Sir Paul McCartney, Coldplay and Arctic Monkeys. This year also saw shows from Ed Sheeran, OneRepublic and The Cure. The Who singer Roger Daltrey is heavily involved and introduced Nutini on stage as ""one of the best young singers in the UK"". He even joined Nutini to duet on the new track Cherry Blossom. ""Roger asked us last year and we couldn't do it,"" explains Nutini. ""I was hoping that Roger would invite us back and he did, I was walking down Buchannan street [in Glasgow] and the phone was in my pocket, and I missed the call. ""I listened to a voice message and it said, 'All right? It's Roger...' No matter how many times I speak to him, you look around and you're like...[mouths] 'It's Roger Daltrey'. ""He's so cool, he's such an inspiration for any vocalist and in general how fit he is and how to sustain the talent that he has."" Challenging fans Nutini hasn't made it easy for fans attending his current shows hoping to hear their favourite songs. Tracks from his earlier albums, such as Jenny Don't Be Hasty and New Shoes are almost unrecognisable - verging on an all out metal assault. ""We're trying to get people into our atmosphere for this new album. I don't want to be like, 'We, owe people hits and we can't do too many new songs in the set, the idea is to draw them into our headspace which is more challenging. ""In the UK people are coming to shows with more of an expectation, they want to jump around to the old brass lines. In Bournemouth, some bloke shouted out, 'Play the songs properly,' 'cause we've reworked the old tracks. but I've got no desire to go over old ground. ""It feels like starting out again, it's a challenge trying to win people over again."" Iron Sky, one of the early stand out tracks from the record and early fan favourite features a sample from the 1939 Charlie Chaplin film The Great Dictator, in which a Jewish barber, in place of the leader of the film's title, delivers a speech urging the people of the world to throw off the shackles of oppressive regimes. As Scots move closer to the 18 September referendum on independence, unsurprisingly the track has been seized upon by some as being a pro-independence call to action. ""I've been asked a lot about the meaning of the song,"" admits Paisley resident Nutini. ""There is disillusion and there is struggle and feelings of injustice that is echoed in the song, of course there is but it was never specific,"" he adds. ""When you're looking around for somebody to help us move forward and you're trying to put your faith in someone and believe in somebody, like a lot of people did with Obama for instance and you see how - even with all the will in the world, politics wins when it comes to him having to pass everything through a Republican Senate and very little really gets done."" And specifically on the issue of the song calling for Scots independence? ""For me, it was never what I set out and it certainly wasn't meant to be a tool for that purpose,"" he insists. ""I think the scale is a lot grander in the problems and issues that I'm talking about ""The Chaplin sample for me just echoes what I'm saying."" Adele's influence The song received some press attention thanks to Oscar-winning singer Adele, who tweeted a link to a video of Nutini performing the song live saying it was ""one of the best things I've ever seen in my life hands down."" ""It's amazing how influential she is, she said it and people picked up on it,"" he says. ""I don't tweet but people send me screenshots. Paloma Faith was really kind as well. We've had great feedback on it. I'm just so happy."" Alongside the more soulful efforts in the album such as Let Her Down Easy, which could have been lifted direct from the archives of Amy Winehouse are more traditional folk- rock tracks like the tender acoustic Better Man and the psychedelic crescendo of Cherry Blossom. Nutini reveals he has a lot more new songs to come in the same vein. ""Ideally, I'd like another album out within a year. We've got a 10 to 14 track record with that type of material, we're flirting with the idea of going down that avenue with the next album. ""Perhaps we'll make it a lot easier and strip the production back and go back to some raw and uncomplicated acoustic tracks. ""There's a hefty bundle of them building up."" Caustic Love is released on 14 April.","Scots singer Paolo Nutini was just 20 when his debut album These Streets came out. Now, seven years later, he is about to release his third album Caustic Love."
"By Sarah Jane GriffithsEntertainment and Arts reporter, BBC News, Copenhagen Some 125 million people around the world are thought to have tuned in to see Austrian drag act Conchita Wurst lift the trophy. Newcomer Molly Smitten-Downes flew the flag for the UK with her self-penned song Children of the Universe, but finished in 17th place with 40 points. The BBC's Sarah Jane Griffiths has been in Denmark to report from behind the scenes. SUNDAY 11 MAY - 12:30 local time (11:30 BST) So that's it. Eurovision has a new champion in Austria's Conchita Wurst and the song contest is done and dusted for another year. The year 2015 will see all the action move to Vienna, where Wurst is already being touted as the host of the proceedings. The bearded drag queen's winning track, Rise Like A Phoenix, is tipped to score a top 10 single in Sunday's official chart countdown. Meanwhile, Molly Smitten-Downes will be hoping it is onwards and upwards - with plans to release her debut album and a second single in the coming months. Having improved on last year's UK score with a respectable 40 points, she can still hold her head high - although it might still be a bit sore from the after party. I'm all checked out of the hotel and squeezing in a quick visit to Copenhagen's famous Tivoli Gardens in a bid to stave off the inevitable PED - that's Post Eurovision Depression to the uninitiated - and yes, it is a recognised problem. ""It's a debilitating illness!"" Dr Eurovision told me before he headed home himself. ""I think it is because people look forward to it so much throughout the whole year and it is very intense for a couple of weeks - some really lovely friendships are formed here at Eurovision but it is a bubble and it isn't real life so when you go back to your job on Monday morning it can be a little bit difficult."" Eurovision superfan Simon Bennett told the BBC the cure was simple. ""The moment I get home, I start organising my next trip to Eurovision!"" Till then. SUNDAY 11 MAY - 01:15 local time (00:15 BST) After a quick costume change - shedding the beaded gold gown for a black lace sleeveless number - Conchita quickly made her way to the winner's press conference. Holding on to her microphone-shaped glass trophy for dear life, she posed for photographers for the duration of her winning song Rise Like A Phoenix, before yet another glitter drop rained down from the ceiling… She first revealed how it felt to hear, or not quite hear, her name read out: ""I was crying the whole time, and suddenly there came this gold shower and I said to my agent, 'did I win?' And he said, 'yes you did!'."" She said she felt Europe had taken a stand by voting her the winner. ""For me my dream came true but for our society it just showed me that there are people out there that want to go in the future and not in the past, and I'm so thankful about that - but I think we said something tonight."" One journalist from The Guardian website asked if she had a message for Russian President Putin. ""I don't know if he's watching,"" she said, before referring to her acceptance speech by adding: ""But if so, I think I said it clear, we are unstoppable."" She later added: ""I dream of a world where we don't have to talk about unnecessary things like sexuality, who you love. I felt like tonight Europe showed that we are a community of respect and tolerance. At the end of the day, it's so cheesy, but we are one."" As with any international press conference there were plenty of random moments, not least Conchita's manager taking the floor for a full five minutes to read out a never-ending list of thank-yous that included the cleaners. ""You're the greatest artist I ever met and I'm so thankful to work with you,"" he said, before adding: ""See you all at wonderful Vienna, Austria - Conchita could be your host of next year!"", before promptly leaving the stage. Conchita too threw her hat in the ring for that job and also revealed there could be some kind of project in the works with two of her fellow Eurovision contenders… Suzy from Portugal and Spain's Ruth Lorenzo. ""Of course I want to go on doing music because this is the love of my life. As you all know there are these three divas in this competition, Suzy, Ruth and me. I really, really fell in love with these two girls, maybe there's something in the future going on."" Definitely a prospect to help keep Eurovision fans happy until next year. SUNDAY 11 MAY - 00:30 local time (23:30 BST) So Austria's bearded lady Conchita Wurst is the clear winner of 2014's Eurovision Song Contest… The knitted ""beards for tolerance"", the free hugs handed out by Conchita supporters and a cracking future-Bond theme all helped Conchita win a place in the hearts of voters across Europe as at least a dozen countries awarded her the maximum 12 points. It had been neck and neck between Austria and runners up The Netherlands for much of the voting, as the points were consistently awarded to one or the other, with a few for third place Sweden and Armenia. But after Ukraine's vote it was revealed Conchita had already won giving her her second standing ovation of the night in the press room and the arena. She later got another 12 points from Switzerland and Slovenia, giving her a total of 290. Fighting back tears she took to the stage to accept her trophy saying: ""This night is dedicated to anyone who believes in a future of peace and freedom... we are unstoppable!"" The voting was also dominated by booing for Russia - each and every time they were awarded an 8, 10 or a 12 points. They managed 7th place with 89 points. That predicted top five place for the UK's Molly Smitten-Downes never materialised - she came in in 17th place - after securing 40 points for Children of the Universe. She tweeted: ""Massive congratulations to Austria. What a brilliant night! Thanks for all the support... Now time to party!! Love you all. Xx"" SATURDAY 10 MAY - 23:30 local time (22:30 BST) Twitter has been on fire tonight - we retweeted loads of #Eurovision bits from the @BBCNewsEnts feed but here's a selection of some of my favourites… On Iceland: ‏@lifeofholly I really like this. It's like a cross between Franz Ferdinand, Barenaked Ladies and Teletubbies. @KeirHusband The Wiggles have let themselves go a bit ‏@PaddysMum2003 Expecting the Inbetweeners to come out dancing to Greece! On Germany: ‏@catrionaw890 This coming after Conchita Wurst is like going back to work after Christmas. On France: @tracey_thorn What a mistake to base your whole song on the moustache in the year of the BEARD On Malta: @LaRainbow:""Mumford and sons meet Gary Barlow"" Switches off TV. Flushes head down toilet. On The Netherlands: ‏@GhettoIFE: Sorry The Nederlands. I'd love to vote for you, but your song is still TOO GOOD. On the voting: ‏@dannywallace Finally! We're on to several hours of politics and maths. Saturday night is back! On Graham Norton: ‏@danisnotonfire: I think I just cringed my neck back so hard for Graham Norton I decapitated myself SATURDAY 10 MAY - 23:00 local time (22:00 BST) Malta: The Mumford and Sons comparisons might be getting a bit tired but it's impossible not to think of the British folk-rockers when listening to Firelight's Coming Home. The band features four siblings and if you recognise Richard, he's another former UK X Factor hopeful. He's also sporting the only Appalachian mountain dulcimer you'll see in this year's Eurovision. Denmark: Could they do the double? If any Bruno Mars fans are watching then there is a good chance Basim might win some votes. The former Danish X Factor star picked the prime spot of 23rd to perform this feel-good do-whoppy, boom-boom song - which makes no more sense than what he's actually singing, which is scuba duba dabda dididai (in case you were wondering). The Netherlands: It won't surprise you to hear The Common Linnets went to Nashville to prepare for Eurovision. It's not your average Eurovision song but the country duo have been inching their way up the betting order all week. Probably one of the only songs I'll be listening to once I leave Eurovision Island. San Marino: Three cheers for Valentina Monetta, who finally made it to the Eurovision final third time lucky with her ballad Maybe. Singing it in front of a giant fan made of satin sheets was an odd choice, and the whispery bit at the end is all a bit toe-curling. So Maybe. But, probably not. United Kingdom: Eurovision's gone out with a bang this year - UK entry Molly's anthemic Children of the Universe is giving ""power to the people"" to finally start voting for the UK again. Hopefully. At 5ft 1ins, she's got some stage presence and gives a goosebump-inducing performance. But is it enough? We will soon see… SATURDAY 10 MAY - 22:40 local time (21:40 BST) Slovenia: Otherwise known as ""flute lady"", Tinkara Kovac lobbied Eurovision organisers to be allowed to play her own instrument, which means she has the added bonus of being able to use said flute as a pointy stick when she's not playing it. She's got a big powerful voice but Round and Round is a bit of a forgettable track. Bonus points for going down the Disney princess route for her dress though. Finland: Strictly speaking, Softengine have more in common with McBusted - but I can't help thinking of them as Finland's answer to One Direction. They do play their own instruments though and the oooh aaah aaah part of their song Something Better could see them nicknamed Junior Coldplay. They're still at school and probably also still recovering from the embarrassment of having their headmaster wish them good luck in a video message during Thursday's semi-final. Spain: Former UK X Factor contestant Ruth Lorenzo could do very well tonight with Dancing in the Rain - she doesn't even seem to mind that she forgot her umbrella. Her powerful, anthemic ballad is full of impressive high notes and has great staging - but will Simon Cowell be voting? Switzerland: Sebalter's pulling out all of the stops; the boy can whistle, play the violin, clap, sing and bang a big drum. There's also a banjo and a tambourine on stage, which means Hunter of Stars wouldn't be a bad song to crack out at a barn dance. Some people might find his cheery disposition off-putting but that would be mean. Hungary: Westlife had stools but Andras Kallay-Saunders has a chair, which is quickly discarded when the drum and base beats come into play. Not convinced by the two dancers chasing each other around the piano and being dragged around on the floor, but Andras did manage to show off his athletic skills by running across the stage, so well done to him. SATURDAY 10 MAY - 22:20 local time (21:20 BST) Austria: Conchita Wurst is a definite contender for the Eurovision crown. Her epic track Rise Like A Phoenix wouldn't be out of place as a Bond theme, and such a powerful voice. No gimmicks needed here - unless you count the beard of course - she can just stand and sing. Does is ruin it if I tell you that under that dress she is standing on an upturned washing-up bowl? Germany: One of the Big Five who automatically qualify, Elaiza were Germany's wildcard. Is it Right is catchier than I'd like it to be. Singer Ela looks and sounds a bit like Pink, if anyone in Pink's band had an accordion. Sweden: The new favourite, Sanna Nielsen is an obvious Celine Dionne fan - but Celine did win Eurovision for Switzerland back in 1988. The arena is full of fans rooting for the Viking blonde who has a great voice, a powerful ballad called Undo and some lovely lighting in her favour. France: I'm not going to lie, I'm a big Twin Twin fan and Moustache would be top five if it was up to me. They're not the best singers in the competition but they've got oodles of charisma and they won't tire of telling you they ""just want to have fun"". Twin Twin, Oh Yeah! They should at least get a few sympathy votes as only one of them seems to have been able to actually grow a moustache. Russia: Former Junior Eurovision winners the Tolmachevy Sisters have mastered the art of see-sawing and singing at the same time, which is not to be sniffed at. I don't really get why they are holding Perspex lightsaber-style poles or wrapping their ponytails together, but they've probably spent most of their performance of Shine hoping they don't get booed again. Italy: Emma is a slightly angry Italian rock chick who is pretty big back home, but as one of the Big Five to automatically qualify, her track La mia citta will be less familiar to Eurovision fans. The fact it's in Italian also limits the amount of people who'll be able to sing along. If I'm honest I'm still thinking about the mozzarella she used to make her Italian flag at the beginning. SATURDAY 10 MAY - 21:55 local time (20:55 BST) Romania: Otherwise known as ""the ones with the circular piano"" (where can I buy one?), Paula Seling and Ovi may have watched one or two '90s music videos before they came. A track from the Basshunter-school of dance anthems, you can picture them now in a cheesy Euro nightclub. She can certainly hit a high note. Armenia: Not Alone has been one of the hot favourites to win and it is possible Aram Mp3 knows it. It's the only Eurovision entry to go down the dubstep route this year but it takes a while to get there - you have to make do with a ballad for most of the track. When it did up the tempo, the electricity stage burst matched Aram/s Matrix boots and that sci-fi coat quite nicely. Montenegro: Sergej Cetkovic was a surprise qualifier and is one of the few acts to sing in their native tongue for his ballad Moj svijet, with what sounds a bit like Panpipe Moods in the background. It is a good job he's got the roller-skating ballerina to keep us all entertained - although the weeping willows in the background look lovely. Poland: One of this year's most memorable acts, Donatan and Cleo's milkmaids have been the talk of Eurovision Island. We Are Slavic was a huge hit back home and sounds a lot like Gwen Stefani's Holla Back, with some traditional Polish music thrown in so they've got something to wave their hankies to. It does leave you with the impression that being a Slavic girl involves washing your clothes in the river and churning butter in a highly suggestive manner. Greece: An East 17-style rap gives way to another retro-sounding club hit with some traditional Greek sounds thrown in. Rise Up seems to have been designed with the sole purpose of getting people to jump up and down. The on-stage trampoline is too tempting for Freaky Fortune and Risky Kidd, but will they get extra points for their back drop? SATURDAY 10 MAY - 21:35 local time (20:35 BST) Eurovision 2014 is go! This year the show is being hosted by three Danish stars - Borgen star Pilou Asbaek, musician, journalist and presenter Nikolaj Koppel, and Lise Ronne who used to host Denmark's X Factor. The show opens with the flags of each country taking part, before each artist strides across the stage, waving and blowing kisses to the crowd and the cameras - giving us a quick taster of what is to come. Here's my take on tonight's proceedings… Ukraine: A giant hamster wheel is definitely one way to kick off Eurovision, but I'm sure I'm not the only one finding it hard to concentrate on Mariya Yaremcuk singing Tick-Tock, because I'm too busy hoping the man inside the hamster wheel doesn't fall off. Mariya was on The Voice in Ukraine and knows how to work a wind machine, as well as hit those high notes of course. Belarus: Maybe it's a Belarus thing but hands up if you've ever actually called anyone your ""sweet cheesecake""? Even though he's ditched the flirty lady from his video and furnished the stage with Teo lookalikes, the Robin Thicke vibe of this track can't be ignored. Their moves - including his weird sidestep thing - look like they might have been made up in the dressing room. Azerbaijan: The second of tonight's artists to go down the circus route, and again I'm too busy worrying for the safety of Dilara Kazimova's trapeze artist to concentrate on her song Start A Fire. A proper Eurovision ballad - well sung, but not a stand out track for me. This video of Dilara singing History Repeating for her country's Eurovision selection process is well worth a watch though. A bit sad she left the amateur dramatics at home tonight. Iceland: Pollapunk's No Prejudice is a definite crowd pleaser - one of this year's fun entries, the punky chorus and their happy vibes are infectious. They also each have dressing gowns in the same bright colours as their suits, but the best Pollapunk fact is that they submitted their hit debut album as coursework on their teacher training course. Norway: Let's slow things right down shall we? Last year's winner Emmelie de Forest is backing Carl Espen to win and his unexpectedly sweet voice delivers powerful ballad Silent Storm in goose-bumpy fashion. Some people might find the simple staging a bit low on kicks but it's got the crowd on their feet, swaying and waving their phones about - the 21st Century, health-and-safety equivalent of lighters in the air. SATURDAY 10 MAY - 20:55 local time (19:55 BST) So there are just a few minutes to go until this year's grand final kicks off! All around me people have been getting their glad rags on in support of their favourite entry… During the show I'll be tweeting from @BBCNewsEnts and giving my reaction on here every five songs or so. Don't forget to refresh the page for the latest updates. The results of the press centre's vote has also been announced so we'll see later how accurate we all were. And if you are playing along at home, you can download a scorecard here. Enjoy! SATURDAY 10 MAY - 18:00 local time (17:30 BST) The countdown is on and we're getting all patriotic here on our make-shift BBC News desk - flying the flag for Molly. Don't forget if you are digging out Union Jacks for your own party at home you can download a scorecard and play along. And if you are twiddling your thumbs waiting for Eurovision to start, then BBC Archive has put together a special album of photos from song contests gone by. That should help pass some time… SATURDAY 10 MAY - 15:00 local time (14:00 BST) I've arrived at the press centre for the final time and I won't be leaving here until we have a Eurovision winner! I'm not alone either - around 1,600 journalists from more than 80 countries are covering this year's contest. Fans arrived thick and fast for this afternoon's final dress rehearsal (yes they really have been doing it all over again before tonight's big show) and a few caught my eye on the way in. Team Molly, led by Carl and Mark, are from London ""and a bit of Sydney as well"" and told me they've been organising Eurovision trips for a couple of years. ""We had 24 in Malmo for Bonnie last year, a hardcore group of fans who just like to have a good time and enjoy all the music and support the UK,"" Mark told me. ""The best thing would be getting the chance to hear a 12 points or a 10 or an 8. Molly's already won from our perspective as she's just a great performer."" Paul is also British but lives in Copenhagen and has come to watch the rehearsal with his Danish family and their Swedish friends - who have already been to seven Eurovisions. ""It's just fun isn't it? Later tonight we're having a Eurovision fancy dress party. We'll be cheering on Denmark and the UK - and Sweden,"" Paul said. Dutch Eurovision fans Richard and Pauline have been here since Monday and are very glad The Common Linnets made it to the final. ""We are doing good in the polls, they are very high so who knows?"" said Richard, sporting The Netherlands flag face-painted on each cheek. ""I love the whole party, the city is one party. We have been five or six times to Eurovision, but we only go to countries who are respectful to the gay community. When I get home I plan for the next year!"" And Conny and Stefan have travelled to Copenhagen from Vienna in Austria, complete with painted-on beards in support of Conchita Wurst. ""For us she is a much more authentic figure than to everyone else, as she has been around for several years working on these issues,"" Conny said. ""It's so cool for us she made it to the final, it would be wonderful if she won."" SATURDAY 10 MAY - 09:45 local time (08:45 BST) It's here! The day Eurovision fans have been waiting for all year… the grand final. The chosen 26 countries will all perform for a global television audience of at least 125 million people tonight, with more than 11,000 expected in the B&W Hallerne arena here in Copenhagen. Last night each act performed for the juries of each country to cast their vote. The bookmakers odds have fluctuated after each show, but according to Oddschecker this morning, which compiles all the big bookies - and our presenter Graham Norton - the UK is in the running for a top five place. Sweden is now favourite, followed by Austria's Conchita Wurst, The Netherlands, Armenia and then the UK. However, if you look at who people are betting on the order shifts - led by Armenia and The Netherlands, and we are the third most popular choice at 11/1. Everyone has been having a go at predicting this year's Eurovision winner. One study has used social media to predict a winner, putting the top three as Armenia, Austria and Sweden - although Italy's entry has the largest number of Twitter followers, Facebook likes and Facebook conversations. Scholars are using their scientific skills and all sorts of complicated things like algorithms to give us some insight into who might lift that trophy later (their study thinks Sweden). And what about the experts in Copenhagen? ""My gut feeling has been the UK all along,"" Eurovision historian John Kennedy O'Connor told me. ""I think the rest of Europe are going to say, 'wow they're doing something good this year', and that will elevate the vote."" He added: ""I think it's between the UK, Austria and Ukraine and I have a feeling the Ukraine sympathy vote might sway everything."" Dr Eurovision - who earned his title by doing a Eurovision inspired PHD - agreed that could play a role. ""Ukraine could pick up some sympathy votes, it will be interesting to see how that goes. But I think Denmark's going to do the double. I think it will pick up sixes and sevens all the way and just sneak there. There's no real outstanding winner though."" We'll see whose predictions are proved right tonight... FRIDAY 9 MAY - 19:00 local time (18:00 BST) So each of the 26 acts have now finished rehearsing for the grand final tomorrow night and the presenters have even gone through the slightly painful process of practising the voting. I was in the arena to see UK entrant Molly perform earlier and, at the risk of getting carried away on an over-excited, super-patriotic, flying-the-flag Eurovision cloud, I thought she was really good. Her dress is all feathers and gold leather and the boho look is completed by henna tattoos on her hands, which she showed off to us backstage. The image on the palm of her hand means the Universe apparently and they have inspired some of the graphics for her staging, along with images of floating Chinese lanterns. Each act will be doing it all over again this evening though, and the pressure is on - each country's jury casts their votes based on tonight's performance. This then counts for 50% of the score tomorrow night, combined with phone votes from the millions watching at home. So will Molly have Europe in the palm of her hands? (sorry) We'll have to wait and see. FRIDAY 9 MAY - 15:45 local time (14:45 BST) I have just returned from my first trip inside the cavernous former shipyard that is playing host to this year's Eurovision Song Contest - B&W Hallerne. And it is impressive. The first rehearsal for tomorrow night's grand final is in full swing and, save for a few technical hitches, things are looking good. There is some seriously impressive lighting, thanks to more than 15,000 LED lights, while the steel framework around the stage references the venue's shipbuilding history. This is where the money has been spent. But the things to look forward to on Saturday night do, of course, include all the gimmicky stuff too: I've just watched a trapeze artist, a trampoline and a roller-skating ballerina - not to mention Ukraine's entry and that hamster wheel. The human hamster took a nasty bump at the end of their rehearsal after they opened the show - let's hope he's ok for tomorrow... It was also my first opportunity to see any of the big six acts, who all qualified for the final automatically, do their thing. Molly is due on stage any minute now, what with her being in 26th place, but French entry Twin Twin have already rehearsed their ridiculously catchy track Moustache. I caught up with Lorent, Francois and Patrick ahead of their rehearsal, and they told me they thought the stage was: ""Big. It's the biggest in the world. It's very impressive."" So Twin Twin, how is your Eurovision experience going? Francois: It is going very, very well, we have played lots of times in the Euro Village and the cafe and the club. It's very cool, it was always a great party. We not only played Moustache but other songs off our album Vive La Vie. It's in French but everybody dance. You've got a big following in France, do you think you will be able to pick up votes around Europe? Francois: We don't really think about that, we think only about our show. We want to do the best and we want to have fun. Fun fun. All [in unison]: Twin Twin, oh yeah! Why did you want to do Eurovision, is it seen as a cool thing to do in France? Francois: You have to differentiate between people and the media. French media thinks that Eurovision is not cool. But people are watching Eurovision, so I think it is a cool thing. It's a great party and that's all. We have a word in England - hipster - do you have that word in France and what do you think of people calling you the hipster Eurovision entry? Francois: Yeah of course, I think this word is everywhere. Lorent: It's funny, because we come from the ghetto, you know, and we are not really hipsters. Some people think that we're from this world, hipsters, because when we arrived in Paris the first people we met were fashion stylists and they gave us clothes! We don't care about the words, but maybe, maybe I am a hipster! Francois: We met a great English stylist, Vivienne Westwood. I have a tie from Vivienne Westwood, I will wear it tomorrow - it is a great tie with curls. I think she is the best. Do you mind people thinking of you as a novelty act? Francois: We are! Yeah, it's cool. Who is your biggest competition? Francois: We don't have rivals because we have our own philosophy about Eurovision. It's like a neighbourhood party, everyone comes with a meal to eat and everybody is sitting around the table and it's a party. Points are not very important to us, it is just… live the experience. It's a great adventure. FRIDAY 9 MAY - 11:15 local time (10:15 BST) As soon as the semi-final was over, Eurovision organisers set to work deciding which order the acts should perform in during Saturday's final. We already knew UK entry Molly would perform in the coveted second half of the competition but we now know she will actually close the show, performing last out of the 26 contestants. John Kennedy O'Connor, who literally wrote the history book on Eurovision (The Eurovision Song Contest - The Official History), was already convinced it would be Molly's year, and thinks being in 26th place is great news for the UK. ""It just gets better for Molly!"" he said this morning. ""The last song has won Eurovision six times. It's the 2nd most 'winningest' spot in the draw after 17th."" This year that honour goes to Slovenia. However John did add a word of warning: ""Since the contest expanded it's not been as great. Ireland sang last and finished last in Malmo 2013. But what a powerful ending for the show! It's great for Molly."" Following two slower songs, from The Netherlands and San Marino, should also help the UK's track Children of the Universe stand out in voters minds, although one expert I spoke to this suggested many people will have made up their mind by three-quarters of the way through. The running order was announced in the early hours as members of the international press, me included, spent time on a tortuously slow shuttle bus (the ""Eurovision shuttle busses are rubbish"" bandwagon has definitely been a behind-the-scenes feature of this year's contest). One passenger read the list out from his phone, greeted by plenty of excited chatter. The buzz from Eurovision super-fans is that it has already been a contest of surprises this year, with acts such as San Marino finally qualifying and Ireland failing to make it through for the first time since 2009. Suggestions The Netherlands' country-tinged duo The Common Linnets could do well are also gaining momentum, so the word on the street is that anything could happen! Saturday night's show will be opened in part by a man running in a giant hamster wheel, as Ukraine's Mariya Yaremchuk takes to the stage first. I'm told no one wants to be in second place as that position has never won Eurovision. So bad luck to Belarus artist Teo and his song Cheesecake - that could be the last we see of him. Here is the running order in full: THURSDAY 8 MAY - 23:55 local time (22:55 BST) Well, that was tense! But we now know exactly which 26 countries will do battle in the Eurovision Song Contest's grand final on Saturday night. Our Danish hosts revealed the 10 acts to make it through tonight's second semi-final, with the help of a dramatic pause that must set a new world record. They finally announced the tenth and final act would be… Austria's Conchita Wurst. My clenched teeth only just survived the experience. She joins Switzerland's whistler Sebalter, Slovenia's Tinkara Kovac, Poland's Donatan & Cleo, Romania's Paula Seling & OVI, Norway's Carl Espen, Freaky Fortune featuring RiskyKidd from Greece, Malta's Firelight, Belarus's Cheesecake singer Teo and Finland's answer to One Direction, Softengine. Those 10 acts and the 10 who made it through on Tuesday join the ""Big six"" in Saturday's final - with the running order due to be announced imminently. After Tuesday night's booing incident, this semi-final was free of any major controversy - unless you count the milkmaids (which we don't really, but more on that in a moment). This time the crowd were belting out cheers for Austria's ""bearded lady"" Conchita Wurst, both in the packed-out press room and in the arena, where people chanted her name before it was read out. Things could have got a little awkward if she hadn't made it through. Conchita said she was overwhelmed by all the support, telling the press conference afterwards: ""I stopped singing and I burst into tears."" They were swiftly followed by laughs, though, as she revealed: ""I don't want to be a woman, I'm a very lazy boy at home and I won't change that."" She added: ""I created this character to show everybody that you can achieve anything and I would never ever shave my beard."" The atmosphere in the Eurovision press centre had definitely stepped up a gear as excitement mounts for the final. The whole complex was buzzing, with Conchita supporters handing out free hugs one minute and Poland's Donatan & Cleo getting mobbed by reporters the next. The Polish duo were even asked about the rather suggestive milkmaids they have on stage to perform We Are Slavic, who have been raising a few eyebrows. ""We have very small outfits,"" agreed Cleo, adding: ""They are very colourful, and my girls look very pretty."" Of course we now say goodbye to Israel, FYR Macedonia, Georgia and Ireland. But the competition gained a new performer tonight too - as Eurovision super-fans Australia sent singer Jessica Mauboy to perform as the votes were counted. THURSDAY 8 MAY - 15:30 local time (14:30 BST) As UK entry Molly cracked on with her day of interviews in the Eurovision press centre, I bumped into Malta's act, Firelight, backstage - just before their final rehearsal for tonight's crucial semi-final. The band - which includes three brothers and a sister, as well as a couple of old friends - have a big fanbase in the UK, much of it made up of family members, as their mother is from Doncaster. Fresh from the make-up room singers Richard, Michelle and Danny, Leslie, Tony and Wayne were in high spirits. So the juries all voted for you when you performed last night but this must be a big night for you, as fans get to vote on tonight's semi-final? Michelle: We're feeling super-excited, confident. It's a family rehearsal next so all our family are going to be out there watching us - my husband, my kids, I feel excited for them as well. We're feeling very positive. The fans, they're such beautiful people, you want to perform your best just for them because they're so passionate. Richard: We were really happy with what we did last night, all we've got to do is maintain that and hopefully it will go well. You've got a lot of British connections in your family haven't you? Richard: Yes, our Mum is English - she's from South Yorkshire, from Doncaster. Danny: She's a Donny lass! Tony: My wife, Jane, comes from Yorkshire as well, she's from York. She lives in Malta but she does a very good Yorkshire pudding! So hopefully the UK fans will be getting behind you? Michelle: They're all watching us tonight. They're all getting together: our uncles, our aunties, our cousins. A big shout out to all our Yorkshire relatives! We've got family all over England too. The UK can vote tonight, so we'd really appreciate your votes if you can... the rest is up to Europe. Some of the press - myself included - have pointed out there is a bit of a Mumford and Sons vibe going on with your track Coming Home, how do you feel about that? Richard: I am a big fan of Mumford and Sons. Folk/rock/pop is a style of music we enjoy doing very much. Wayne: It used to be the style, before electronic music came along. There was nothing better than performing a song with your acoustic instruments. It seems like it's all coming back again, which is great. Richard: We're just having a blast doing that style of music. It's real music. THURSDAY 8 MAY - 11:30 local time (10:30 BST) So tonight 10 more acts will be selected for the Eurovision Song Contest grand final on Saturday - which means another five will be going home disappointed. Among this evening's hopefuls are Austria's bearded lady Conchita Wurst, Switzerland's whistling fiddler Sebalter and Ireland's Can-Linn, featuring Kasey Smith. She's being cheered on by Irish MTV presenter Laura Whitmore, who has joined BBC Radio 1 DJ Scott Mills on Eurovision presenting duties this year and will be co-hosting tonight's semi-final on BBC Three at 20:00 BST. We caught up for a quick chat before the mayhem descends… So how is your first Eurovision? Surreal! I always knew it was huge - but it makes you realise how big it is. There are so many different people from different countries in one city and everyone has that one thing in common, which is Eurovision. People can make fun of the Eurovision, they can take it with a pinch of salt but for this week here, everyone's in good spirits and it's just a great celebration. Who are you rooting for? Besides the UK and Ireland obviously - I'm a big fan of the Irish entry. I really love the Netherlands song but it's so different for Eurovision, it's quite country, I don't know if it will win. Malta has a bit of a Mumford and Sons vibe. I quite like Greece as well - I saw them performing in the Euro Club - and I love Iceland, just for the pure fun of it. I'm really sad Latvia's Cake to Bake didn't get through, they were really fun. That's the sad thing, you lose six in the first semi-final and five tonight - but otherwise it would be very, very long on Saturday! For anyone just to get to Copenhagen is huge for the country though. Everyone's a winner! How do you feel about presenting BBC Three's Eurovision coverage this year? It's huge for me and it's my first job for the BBC as well. When I was younger - I'm not even joking - I watched Eurovision every year. I'm Irish so we're obsessed with it over there, because we used to win it all the time! As a kid you'd sit and watch it and you'd imagine doing the commentary over it and what you'd say. So now it's really weird to be up there, in that little sweaty box with Scott, actually doing it. It's amazing and I love it. WEDNESDAY 7 MAY - 23:45 local time (22:45 BST) So we hotfooted it to the British embassy on a mission to find UK Eurovision entry Molly Smitten-Downes, arriving just as she was taking to the floor. In the absence of an actual stage for the intimate performance (in a room the size of someone's lounge) she did actually take to the floor, flanked by her backing singers and a lone drum beat for a beautifully stripped-back version of her song Children of the Universe. ""We're quite happy with this - I hope you enjoy it,"" Molly told the packed room, where some of the crowd sat cross-legged on the floor, clapping along. ""I'm overwhelmed by the support we've had back home and in Europe. We've been made so welcome in Copenhagen and being at the British embassy means a lot,"" she said. While other guests munched on canapes, the 26-year-old from Leicestershire followed her performance with a few quick interviews ahead of Thursday's full day of press - as she takes a day off the singing to try to rest her vocal chords for Saturday. No one was resting much of anything over at the Eurovision Fan Cafe though, which has taken over Huset-KBH - ""the oldest and largest culture house in Denmark"" at 43 years old. The inviting venue has even renamed its traditional Danish courtyard Emmelie's Forest, in honour of last year's winner. Swedish Eurovision entry Sanna Nielsen was among Wednesday night's performers after sailing through the first semi-final on Tuesday. She is a firm favourite among many Eurovision fans, having entered Sweden's Eurovision selection contest - Melodifestivalen - a very committed seven times. The likes of Greece and Austria, meanwhile, were hopefully taking my cue and getting an early (ish) night ahead of Thursday night's second semi-final - just 10 out of the 15 acts performing will survive the cull. WEDNESDAY 7 MAY - 16:30 local time (15:30 BST) Hello and welcome to this year's Eurovision Reporter's Diary, coming to you live and direct from what is being called ""Eurovision Island"". How very grand... I am comfortably installed in this year's Eurovision headquarters, former shipyard B&W Hallerne on Copenhagen's Refshaleoen island, which has undergone a multi-million pound refit to host 2014's contest. Once home to toiling shipbuilders, for the next few days it is playing host to thousands of Eurovision fans from around the world, not to mention the press who will be keenly dissecting every fabulous (or not-so-fabulous) move this year's contestants make. Our press centre is a gigantic tent alongside the great halls where we can keep a close eye on what is going on in the arena on big screens, while munching on rye bread-based snacks from the canteen (we are in Denmark, after all). Rehearsals are currently in full swing for tomorrow night's second semi-final, which will decide on the final 10 acts going through to the main event - Saturday night's grand final. But there are an enormous amount of activities planned to keep fans entertained until then. For a start, the city's famous shopping street Stroget has been renamed 'Fan Mile'. Fan Mile starts at City Hall Square and ends in the old Nyhavn harbour, where fans can get a boat straight to Eurovision Island. According to the magazine I was handed on my arrival at the airport earlier, it ""connects the dots of entertainment on the streets and squares like pearls on a string."" I'm in. In fact, it is definitely on the list of things to do tomorrow - not least because it's where the world's longest kiss chain is being attempted by the Aids foundation (they need more than 351 people kissing to beat the Guinness World Record). It is actually time for me to depart Eurovision Island for today, as well. Our UK entry, Molly Smitten-Downes is hosting a swanky event at the British Embassy this evening, to celebrate British Music. I have a ticket so will report back to you in good time.","This year's Eurovision Song Contest has taken place in Copenhagen, Denmark."
"By Ian YoungsEntertainment & arts reporter Instead of a red carpet, stars walked a green carpet (well, a strip of artificial grass) at the Oscar Wildes, dubbed the ""Irish Oscars"", on Thursday. On Wednesday there was a black carpet for the All Def Movie Awards - a cheeky response to the #OscarsSoWhite furore. More exclusive parties - and an anti-Trump rally - are to come on Friday. They are all part of a flurry of events that take place in Oscar week, allowing the film industry to congratulate itself even more and casting some of the limelight on underrepresented groups, worthy causes and brands. Irish Oscar nominee Ruth Negga and Outlander actress Caitriona Balfe were honoured at the 12th Oscar Wildes, staged by the US-Ireland Alliance at director JJ Abrams' Santa Monica HQ. Balfe was greeted at the event by fans carrying a banner reading: ""Outlander: We love you Caitriona"". She said: ""Irish people will always make a little community wherever they go and LA is no different. It's really important that you have this community that you can rely on."" Also on Thursday, the Black Women in Hollywood Awards hosted stars including Oscar nominee Viola Davis and fellow actresses Janelle Monae and Aja Naomi King. That came a day after the All Def Movie Awards, which were set up by entertainment mogul Russell Simmons last year to reward the films that Oscar forgot. He said his ceremony was worth staging again, despite the fact that many more films with black stars and black stories are nominated this year compared with the previous two years. ""There's still a lack of sensitivity on the part of the gatekeepers,"" he told BBC News. ""I love the industry. I want to see us more inclusive. I broke my neck for the last 30 years to be included, despite the fact that Hollywood's not been breaking its neck to be inclusive."" Other Oscar-related events on Thursday ranged from parties thrown by Dolby, Cadillac and Ebony magazine to a benefit concert staged by Artists for Peace and Justice. Friday is the peak day for pre-Oscar parties. There will be events to celebrate British, Australian and Italian film-makers; a cocktail reception for this year's 46 female Oscar nominees; an award show thrown by publicists; and a ceremony to celebrate Latinos in the media. But the United Talent Agency has decided not to take part in the partying this year. It has cancelled its annual pre-Oscar bash - deciding instead to hold a rally to protest at US President Donald Trump's plan for a travel ban on people coming from seven mainly Muslim countries. Jodie Foster, Michael J Fox, Cynthia Erivo and Wilmer Valderrama are among the actors who are due to give speeches. That means it is likely to garner more attention than all of the more frivolous gatherings - and will give a taste of what to expect on what is likely to be a politically-charged Oscar night.

"Doctors, midwives and pro-choice charities highlighted the issue after the BBC's Action Line website was advertised after the programme aired. Excluding abortion was ""stigmatising"", they said. The BBC said while it does not link to campaign groups there was no reason not to link to abortion advice. A spokesperson said: ""Abortion is a controversial subject across the UK, but there's no reason why the BBC cannot link to advice sites which provide information on it."" It said some groups may not be selected for Action Line links because they are ""campaigning organisations"". The episode of Call the Midwife, broadcast on 3 February, featured Jeannie, who found herself unexpectedly pregnant with her third child. Refused a legal termination, she paid an illegal provider and died from an infection. After the episode, viewers were directed to the BBC's Action Line if they had been affected by the issues raised. A joint letter from the Royal College of Midwives, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, Marie Stopes UK, the sexual health advice service Brook and the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) praised the programme for having ""repeatedly handled this issue sensitively and courageously"". But they said that people visiting the Action Line website found that abortion was not explicitly mentioned. Instead, there was a link to information about pregnancy on the NHS website - which features abortion information elsewhere. The healthcare organisations called on the BBC to include links to evidence-based information about terminations. Katherine O'Brien, head of policy and research at BPAS, said it was ""highly stigmatising to the women we care for and to the doctors and midwives who provide them with care"" to treat abortion differently from other medical procedures."" She said it was ""inadequate"" to expect women to search the NHS website after being directed to Action Line at the end of the programme. The 1967 Abortion Act established legal abortion in most of the UK, but in Northern Ireland terminations are only permitted when a woman's life is at risk or if there is a risk of permanent and serious damage to her mental or physical health. John Deighan, deputy CEO of the Society for the Protection of the Unborn Child, an anti-abortion group, said the Action Line site was right not to include links on abortion. He said: ""The issues raised in the 'Call the Midwife' programme are controversial. I can understand reservations over which helpline numbers would have been appropriate to provide."" Call the Midwife has previously won plaudits for tackling issues such as female genital mutilation, cleft lips and palates, and sickle cell disease.",The BBC has been criticised for not linking directly to information on abortion after the issue was dealt with in an episode of Call the Midwife.
"By Rebecca JonesArts correspondent One of them contains the 19th Century scientist's famous Tree of Life sketch, exploring the evolutionary relationship between species. Following an ""extensive search"", curators have now concluded they have probably been stolen. They are launching a public appeal for help in trying to find them. ""This is heartbreaking,"" Dr Jessica Gardner, the university's librarian, tells the BBC. ""We will leave no stone unturned,"" in trying to discover what has happened, she adds. The notebooks were last seen in November 2000 after ""an internal request"" to remove them from a special manuscripts storeroom to be photographed. They were taken to a temporary studio, which at the time was in a temporary building in the grounds of the university library because building work was taking place. It was only during ""a routine check"" two months later that it was discovered they were missing. ""We know they were photographed in November,"" says Dr Gardner. ""But we do not know what happened between then and the time in January 2001, when it was determined they were not in their proper place on the shelves. ""And I'm afraid there isn't anything on the remaining record which tells us anything more."" Initially librarians thought they might have been put back in the wrong place. ""My predecessors genuinely believed they had been misfiled and they would find them,"" adds Dr Gardner, who became director of library services in 2017. There were a number of ""intense"" searches over the years. They all drew a blank. Perhaps it is not that surprising given the size of the library. It is vast, containing more than 200km of shelving, roughly the distance from Cambridge to Southampton by road. It is home to more than 10 million maps and manuscripts and other objects. At the beginning of this year, Dr Gardner arranged a new search. Specialist staff combed through specific zones of the library's storage facilities. They conducted a ""fingertip"" check through 189 boxes which contain Darwin's books, drawings and letters. But still no notebooks. A new approach was needed, according to Dr Gardner. She says she was ""not willing to accept"" the notebooks would just ""turn up"". So she and her team ""completely reviewed what happened at the time and critically we took a big step back from what had become a common understanding that they had been mis-shelved. ""Reluctantly I have decided that was not the right conclusion."" 'Probably stolen' Instead, she believes: ""These notebooks have probably been stolen."" Theft, she says, ""should be ruled in as a possibility from the start and that wasn't"". Security procedures, she explains, have been ""revised and reviewed"" and ""tightened"" over the last two decades. ""Now if anything of this scale and significance was not found we would be going to the police."" Cambridgeshire Police have now been informed and the disappearance of the notebooks has been recorded on the national Art Loss Register for missing cultural artefacts. The police have also added the missing notebooks to Interpol's database of stolen artworks. 'Inside Darwin's head' In July 1837, Charles Darwin was a young man of 28. At his home in London, he wrote at the top of the page of one of his red leather notebooks, ""I think"". Then he drew a spindly sketch of a tree. He had recently returned from the Galapagos Islands aboard HMS Beagle and was working through scientific ideas inspired by his trip. ""These notebooks really are Darwin's attempt to pose to himself the question about where do species come from, what is the origin of species?"" explains Jim Secord, emeritus professor of history and philosophy of science at Cambridge University. More than 20 years later, on 24 November 1859, Darwin published a more fully developed tree of life in On the Origin of Species. ""It's almost like being inside Darwin's head when you're looking at these notebooks,"" says Professor Secord. ""They're jottings of all sorts of information that he's writing down. ""You have the sense of him working through these ideas at great speed and that kind of intellectual energy which I think the notebooks really convey. ""I'm a fan of James Joyce and it's always struck me that it's a bit like Leopold Bloom on steroids. You just get the sense of scientific imagination running really deep."" Although the notebooks have been digitised, Professor Secord says the scans can never replace the real thing. ""To have such an iconic object go missing is really a tragedy."" The notebooks themselves are small, no bigger than a postcard. They were kept in a bespoke blue box, about the size of a paperback. It is still possible the notebooks might be found. ""We won't stop looking,"" says Dr Gardner. But it will take another five years to complete a full search of the remaining shelves and storage rooms. In the meantime, the library is asking the public for help. ""There are good examples where things have been found, thanks to the help of the public,"" says Dr Gardner. ""So I would really appeal to members of the public, former staff, researchers, anyone who might have information which would shed light. But Dr Gardner is reluctant to speculate where the notebooks might be. ""It's possible they are under a bed, that's the best case scenario, someone has found they can't sell them or they're just holding on to them,"" she says. ""This is the time to just safely, even anonymously, get in touch. ""It's those new leads we're looking for, with the help of the police, in order to help recover these for the nation."" Anyone who may have information about the missing notebooks is asked to contact Cambridge University Library, via email at ManuscriptAppeal@lib.cam.ac.uk or Cambridgeshire Police. Who was Charles Darwin? Charles Darwin was an English scientist - naturalist, geologist and biologist - best known for his work on the theory of evolution by natural selection. His groundbreaking work, On the Origin of Species, was published in 1859 and changed the way we think about the natural world. At the time it was highly controversial, as it provided evidence that certain animals had evolved from others over time, apparently best fit for their surroundings. This was at odds with the long-established religious belief that God had created all creatures, great and small. Darwin studied the divergence of 18 species of passerine birds [""Darwin's finches""] in the Galápagos Islands, in the Pacific. He noted the remarkable diversity in beak form and function. ""Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history,"" he wrote, as a result. In his second seminal publication, 1871's The Descent of Man, Darwin applied his theory to the evolution of humans, suggesting we share a common ancestor with the great apes. (Homo sapiens are now believed to have evolved alongside orangutans, chimpanzees, bonobos, and gorillas.) Simple yet profound, his theory is one of the most influential scientific ideas ever conceived. Even today, its conclusions and implications have an impact on religion, politics, economics and art, as well as our understanding of the world around us.

"The actor is suing publisher News Group Newspapers (NGN) over a 2018 article that alleged he was violent and abusive towards his ex-wife Amber Heard. At a preliminary hearing on Wednesday, the newspaper group said he sustained the injury during ""an alcohol and drug-addled rage against Ms Heard"" in 2015. But he claims his finger was fractured when she threw a glass bottle at him. The couple met in 2011, married in 2015 and settled their divorce out of court in 2017. Ms Heard, who is giving evidence in support of The Sun, has accused her ex-husband of grabbing, shoving and strangling her while they were on holiday in Australia. She claims he ""severely injured his finger, cutting off the top"" while he was smashing a telephone against a wall, according to NGN's barrister Adam Wolanski QC. But Mr Depp claims Ms Heard threw a glass bottle at him, which smashed and fractured his finger, before she put ""a cigarette out on [Mr Depp's] right cheek"". Mr Wolanski said the accounts of what happened were ""diametrically opposed"" and claimed Mr Depp's version of events was undermined by texts he later sent to his doctor. Penelope Cruz and Winona Ryder have provided written statements that express surprise and shock at seeing him characterised as violent. According to Mr Wolanski, Ms Heard believes her ex-husband is ""leaking evidence which he thinks supports his case into the press"".

"By Annabel RackhamEntertainment reporter ""I was a struggling army wife going to community college who didn't know what to do with my life,"" she tells the BBC. ""I would read a lot of fan fiction on [publishing website] Wattpad and felt I had read everything so one day I decided to write a chapter."" That chapter, the start of a story based on One Direction singer Harry Styles, would eventually be turned into a book series and now a Hollywood film. Now 29, the Ohio native has published five books in the After series and three other novels. 'I couldn't even use my own name on Twitter' The story of a relationship between college student Tessa Young and Harry Styles (who would become Hardin Scott in print) was Anna's passion project as a huge One Direction fan. ""When I started I had no followers but I did it for fun,"" Todd says. ""After I wrote the first chapter I wanted to know what happened so every day I would write a chapter and it became more popular. ""I could see the numbers go up and when I tried to make a Twitter account I couldn't even use my own name because all these fan accounts already existed - I realised people actually cared and loved it. ""Wattpad contacted me and said publishers and agents had reached out, I was even getting messages from agents and didn't understand what was happening. ""I went to New York and met with four publishing houses and there was an auction - every publisher wanted me to take down my online chapters and I didn't want to do it. ""I kept saying no and they gave in."" Todd wanted to keep her work online so that new people found it and also so she could read comments. To date, her online version has received over 1.5 billion views, whilst her published book has sold over 11 million copies worldwide and has been translated into 30 languages. After: The Movie Todd is three weeks into her role as producer on After: The Movie and speaks to the BBC from the set, which is based in Atlanta, Georgia. ""Being here feels amazing and really surreal, my entire life has changed. It's crazy seeing these characters come to life and I've been very involved in the re-writes and casting."" The lead, Hardin Scott is played by Hero Fiennes Tiffin, who is best known for playing young Tom Riddle in Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince. He is also the nephew of actors Ralph and Joseph Fiennes. His co-lead, Josephine Langford, who also has famous connections as the sister of 13 Reasons Why actress Katherine, plays Tessa Young. Another important factor for Todd was having a strong female team, in light of the lack of female representation in the Hollywood film industry. ""Our team and crew are nearly all women, so we understand the story and know how to portray those women. ""It's been incredible - we've had a lot of crew members say they've never worked with this many women on a film before."" Asked if there might be a cameo from Harry Styles, Todd says it's unlikely, but his management know about the fan fiction and the film production. ""Sony (who manage One Direction) paid a writer to make the first original fan fiction about the band - I can't imagine they were upset (to find out about her work)."" And has she met the man himself? ""No! I wish I would have met the band in an organic way - I don't want to make them feel like they have to meet me because I'm a fan girl,"" she says. Advice from EL James Anna Todd is not the first fan fiction writer to have secured a publishing deal and film rights from their work. She's become friends with Fifty Shades author EL James, whose writing started out as a take on Stephanie Meyer's Twilight series and ended up as a million dollar franchise. Todd says their friendship influenced her decision to bring out three books before the After film came out, so she wasn't remembered for only writing One Direction fan fiction. ""With EL James - she and I have become friends now and she told me: 'No matter what I write now people talk about 50 Shades.' ""It's good that I've put out different books apart from After - and before the film comes out."" Fandoms as ""obsessive"" The decision to diversify her writing wasn't because Todd was worried about some of the negative connotations that come with online fandom, but this opinion is something she wants to change. ""Ironically, people who called me obsessive would get into a fight over a football game,"" she says. ""You wouldn't say that to someone who queued overnight for sports tickets or a new Apple product, but you'll have a go at teenage girls who like One Direction?"" She says if it wasn't for fandoms she would ""never have been able to publish a novel"". ""For me, One Direction is the only fandom I've been in and I made so many friends. ""The internet can help you come out of your shell and gives you a chance to make friends who have the same passion as you, it's a real community.""

"The autumn show at Tate Britain will feature more than 200 paintings and other artefacts dating back 400 years. ""It's been the most difficult project I've worked on,"" admitted curator Alison Smith at Monday's launch event. ""The real challenge was selecting the material to make a wonderful show without being celebratory of empire. ""It's been a gradual process of refining and selecting. We've had intense debates about what to include."" Opening on 25 November, the show will feature art from across the British Isles, North America, the Caribbean, the Pacific, Asia and Africa. The work of contemporary British artists, including Hew Locke and Andrew Gilbert, has been included ""to offer fresh interpretations of colonial imagery and confront the problematic legacies of Empire in the present day"". Dr Smith said the exhibition would present facts and let the viewer make up their own minds. There are plans to set up a screen showing people's responses to some of the exhibits. ""We don't want to be didactic - we want to bring people into the exhibition to allow them to bring their own experiences and memories,"" she said. Among the paintings on show will be Lady (Elizabeth) Butler's 1879 oil painting The Remnants of an Army, showing on horseback the man who was thought to be the only survivor of the 1842 retreat from Kabul during the First Afghan War. The painting has not been shown for more than 50 years and is being restored for the exhibition. It was part of the original art collection that Henry Tate, an industrialist who had made his fortune in sugar, used to found the Tate Gallery. Dr Smith said: ""Lady Butler belonged to a group of thinkers who were critical of British colonial policy and this was partly produced to show history repeating itself with disastrous consequences - though at the time it was seen to be a heroic image of endurance and survival at the very edges of the empire."" Tate director Sir Nicholas Serota said: ""This is an exhibition that will open up some quite difficult issues. It's a beginning rather than an end.""

"By Mark SavageBBC music reporter ""I felt like I'd regressed 20 years and gone to my first concert,"" enthuses the DJ. ""He was incredible. Just celebrated his 80th birthday and his voice was still great, so I felt really, really privileged."" Under normal circumstances, Nelson wouldn't be treated to a private audience with a singing knight of the realm. But these are abnormal times - and there was a plan afoot. This Sunday should have been the 10th instalment of BBC Radio 2 Live In Hyde Park - a ""festival in a day"" that sees the nation's biggest radio station throw a huge party for 50,000 fans in central London. This year's line-up was signed and sealed at the start of 2020, but it soon became apparent that coronavirus was going to play havoc with the live music industry. 'Hugely different' ""A lot of us realised in March that things were going to be hugely different,"" says Radio 2's head of music Jeff Smith. ""And I thought to myself, 'We need to make some plans'."" Almost immediately, he says, he ""had a vision that we would try to replicate the feel of a park or an outdoor event in the context of a virtual concert"". The search began for an alternative venue - one sufficiently secluded to stop crowds gathering, but big enough to accommodate the articulated trucks the BBC would need to build a set and film the show. Once the location was identified (an undisclosed but impressive manor house outside London), Smith went back to the artists. Some had to pull out, but the core line-up remained intact. And so, this weekend, audiences will get to see and hear Sir Tom playing in the open air alongside The Killers, Craig David, Chic, Sheryl Crow, The Pretenders, Erasure and McFly for Radio 2 Live At Home. ""Let's be honest, we've actually provided them with a decent backdrop,"" says Nelson, who will host the TV coverage with Jo Whiley. ""I've seen enough bookshelves to last a lifetime."" Pulling the concert together was no easy task. The crew had to be kept to a bare minimum, and every performer had to have Covid-19 tests and temperature checks on site. ""The risk assessment was about 35 pages long,"" says Rhys Hughes, head of content for the BBC's Live Music team. But even after months of planning, Hughes was ambushed by the one thing he couldn't account for - the British weather. ""We caught the back of Storm Ellen as we were building the set,"" he says. ""The crew had 50 or 60mph winds, torrential rain and lightning, and a couple of trees went down."" Chrissie Hynde of The Pretenders had to perform her soundcheck in the middle of a downpour - but when it came to filming the actual performances, ""the weather gods smiled on us and we just about got away with it"". For many of the performers, the concert was the first chance they'd had to perform live in months - albeit without an audience. ""It was a bit surreal, if I'm honest,"" says Rebecca Ferguson, who recorded her half of a duet with US-based Nile Rodgers on the day. ""It felt a bit like I was partying alone in a field - but I had my mum dance about and had fun on my own. ""Just to get out there and sing again... I felt so grateful to be able to do what I love."" For Nelson, watching the performances felt ""strangely intimate"". ""It's very naked for the artists because there was no feedback from the audience. So they had to be seasoned performers who could still turn it on."" Some, like Erasure's Andy Bell, were inspired by the scenery. ""It really was an immersive wildlife experience,"" he says, ""with actual butterflies and bees darting around the flowers - so you may see a few little creatures photobombing the set!"" Others, like McFly, were transported back to their early days as a band. ""The first gig I ever did was for my nan's birthday in the garden like this,"" observes bassist Dougie Poynter. ""Yeah, I've done a few of these,"" replies his bandmate Danny Jones. ""You know, when your mum goes, 'Why don't you play at the barbecue tonight with your band'?"" Sheryl Crow's 'portable audience' However, the lack of an audience posed a challenge for Hughes. How to capture the show on film without it feeling sterile? ""I've seen a bit of footage of socially-distanced country shows in venues in America and it just looks awful,"" he confesses. ""They're in a 4,000-capacity venue with 300 people inside and it can't be a great experience. ""So it's difficult to get that atmosphere, and we had to concentrate on the music and how we film and record that, to shoot it tight and make the visual backdrop look interesting for the audience."" Sheryl Crow, filming at her home in Nashville, had a more creative solution to the problem. ""As there was no actual audience I thought I'd bring my own on a little electronic speaker which let me play in some clapping sounds,"" she says. ""It wasn't quite a stadium roar, but a bit of fun for the performance."" The American acts all brought an extra touch of glamour - with The Killers playing a set on top of Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas and Gregory Porter performing to panoramic views of Los Angeles from the roof of the Capitol Records building (accompanied, virtually, by the BBC Concert Orchestra). The footage looks spectacular, providing a breath of fresh air after months of lo-fi live streams. ""Live from Lady Gaga's kitchen - we've all probably had enough of that,"" laughs Hughes. But the Live At Home concert also highlights a more serious problem - the future of the live music industry. With concerts cancelled all summer long, and for the foreseeable future, up to 60% of jobs in the sector could be lost. For many of the crew working on Radio 2's show, from the caterers to the stage hands, it was the first job they'd had all year. ""Some of them said they'd had job offers in Dubai,"" says Nelson. ""Another guy hadn't done anything. The caterers were saying normally they'd be doing festivals. So it hit home to me how strangling Covid is for live performances. ""It's really cut the guts out of the live music industry."" No-one really wants to repeat this socially-distanced version of the festival next summer - and the government has just announced plans to trial mass testing for audiences for indoor and outdoor venues - but the possibility is always there. ""Who really knows?"" says Smith. ""In my head, I'm planning for next year. I've got headliners. But we just don't know where those people will be at that particular time."" Hughes says everyone in the live music sector is ""watching the money to see what happens with football"". ""If we're in a position where football stadiums are full again by the end of the season next May, then hopefully things will be good. If we get a second spike, I think all bets are off for 2021."" But for now, Smith is optimistic that audiences will enjoy the alternative festival - even if they're missing out on the ""trestle tables and the hampers in the park"".

"The concert in Carnegie Hall was announced on 10 January as a retrospective of Bowie's life. But hours later, the singer's family announced his death from cancer. The concert then quickly sold out. Among the acts performing were the Flaming Lips, the Pixies, Debbie Harry, Cyndi Lauper and former REM singer Michael Stipe. Demand was so high that a second concert was added for Friday night at Radio City Music Hall. It will be broadcast online.

Another of his hits, Starman, brought the crowd to its feet, in a performance by Blondie leader Debbie Harry. Heart's Ann Wilson got the audience moving with Let's Dance. The Flaming Lips performance saw singer Wayne Coyne wearing a suit of lights sat atop the shoulders of a band mate dressed as Chewbacca to sing Life on Mars. But Cyndi Lauper's version of Suffragette City and Laurie Anderson's take of Always Crashing in the Same Car seemed to have failed to impress the public. Other hits such as Rebel, Rebel and Life on Mars, and some more obscure songs, were also performed. Carnegie Hall was where Bowie made his New York debut in 1972, a city where he would live for 20 years. The annual tribute concerts, that have previously focused on acts including Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen and Joni Mitchell, were set up to raise money for charity. Organisers were overwhelmed by requests by performers keen to take part after Bowie's death. ""We felt kind of awkward because we are usually so humbly grateful to anyone who wants to participate in this,"" producer Michael Dorf said.

"Evaristo became the first black woman to win the prestigious award this year, sharing it with Margaret Atwood. In its Turner Prize coverage on Tuesday, a BBC newsreader referred to Atwood but not Evaristo. The BBC said presenter Shaun Ley's phrasing had been ""unscripted"" and ""apologised for the offence caused"". The item focused on the decision of the four artists nominated for the Turner Prize to share the award between them. Discussing their decision on Tuesday night, Ley said: ""Now, this is a bit different from the Booker Prize earlier in the year where the judges couldn't make up their minds, so they gave it to Margaret Atwood and another author, who shared the prize between them.""

""This part of the item was unscripted and he didn't say Bernardine Evaristo's name at the time. We apologise to her for the offence caused."" Viewing figures show around 191,000 people were watching the news channel at the time. A clip was uploaded to Twitter by a campaign group which promotes diversity in literature, who described Ley's comments as ""not good enough"".

"By Tim MastersEntertainment correspondent, BBC News Launching the first two episodes at London's Olympia, Moffat pleaded with journalists to keep the show's secrets under wraps. The opener sees Matt Smith's Doctor reunited with Karen Gillan's Amy Pond, Arthur Darvill's Rory and Alex Kingston's River Song in 1960s America. The quartet team up with President Nixon to fight a new alien threat. The aliens - partly inspired by Edvard Munch's The Scream - are introduced in the two opening episodes, The Impossible Astronaut and Day of the Moon. The programmes, which feature scenes shot in the Utah desert last year, will be shown on BBC One later this month. ""To be honest, it's darker than any other opener of a season,"" said Moffat, who wrote both episodes. ""We've been pretty dark before in Doctor Who. But we're coming in from the dark side just because we haven't done it that way before."" Yet Moffat, who took over as lead writer and executive producer, said he did not think the shows were too scary for children. ""First of all, you make Doctor Who frightening to appeal to children. It's the children who find it frightening, not the adults. ""Children absolutely rank Doctor Who stories in order of frightening-ness - that's what it's about. ""You put the jokes in and the silly bits in for the adults and you put the scares in for the kids. I've got two kids of my own and I'd never do anything I didn't think was acceptable for them. ""Having said that, one of them does tend to sleep on our bedroom floor."" Future episodes will feature such guest stars as model Lily Cole, Downton Abbey's Hugh Bonneville as a pirate and ex-Coronation Street actress Suranne Jones. The latter will appear in a story called The Doctor's Wife, written by fantasy author Neil Gaiman. 'Tease, don't tell' For the first time this year's season is being split in two. The first seven episodes will air from 23 April, with the final block of six broadcast in the autumn. ""If you run for 13 weeks you can start to feel as though you can miss one episode and it'll be okay,"" Moffat said. ""We don't want that feeling. We stop for a few weeks and let you all worry about what's happening and then come back."" Moffat went on to ask journalists to avoid spoilers, saying it would be ""a lot more fun for the kids"" if nothing was given away. ""Tease them but don't tell them,"" he pleaded. And asked about plans for Doctor Who's 50th anniversary in 2013, he would only say: ""Yes, there are thoughts...""",Doctor Who boss Steven Moffat has said the new season of the sci-fi show kicks off in a darker style than usual.
"Earlier this week, jurors in Los Angeles decided that parts of Gaye's 1977 hit Got To Give It Up were lifted for the duo's 2013 hit Blurred Lines. The family of the late soul singer were awarded $7.3m (£4.8m) in damages. But the musicians' lawyer said they remained adamant Blurred Lines was original, created solely by them. ""We owe it to songwriters around the world to make sure this verdict doesn't stand,"" Howard King told Fox Business News. ""My clients know that they wrote the song Blurred Lines from their hearts and souls and no other source. ""We are going to exercise every post-trial remedy we have to make sure this verdict does not stand."" Mr King added that expert evidence in the case, which may have swayed the jury, should have been inadmissible. In particular, said Mr King, the testimony from a musicologist that compared Blurred Lines with Got To Give It Up was based on elements of Gaye's song that were not on the original sheet music. At the time of its copyright, only the written music could be registered as protected, not sound recordings. ""Clearly the jury relied on what that expert said in reaching their conclusion,"" said Mr King. Gaye died in April 1984, leaving his children the copyright to his music. His children - Nona, Frankie and Marvin Gaye III - sued Thicke and Williams in 2013. After Tuesday's ruling - which saw the US singers ordered to pay $7.4 million (£4.8m) to Gaye's family - the family's lawyer told Rolling Stone he wanted to stop the sales of Blurred Lines. The 2013 track is one of the biggest-selling hits to date. ""Right now, I feel free,"" Nona Gaye told reporters after the ruling. ""Free from... Pharrell Williams and Robin Thicke's chains and what they tried to keep on us and the lies that were told."" In court, Williams told jurors that Gaye's music was part of the soundtrack of his youth but he insisted it was not on his mind when he wrote the song. But the musician recognised a likeness between the songs and agreed he was ""channelling... that late-70s feeling"" when he co-wrote the song. The hit, which earned a Grammy nomination, generated more than $16m (£10.8m) in profits and made more than $5m (£3m) for both stars.",Pharrell Williams and Robin Thicke are to appeal the verdict which ruled that they copied a Marvin Gaye track.
"By Tim MastersEntertainment and arts correspondent, BBC News ""If chess knowledge was a swimming pool, I was in the shallow end,"" says Liz Garbus, director of documentary Bobby Fischer Against the World. ""As we explore in the film, the deep end knows no bottom."" Garbus's documentary is a portrait of the American chess player which focuses on his famous 1972 tournament in Iceland against the Russian Boris Spassky. The matches were as much about the Cold War as they were about chess. Fischer v Spassky dominated headlines around the world. ""It was moment when metaphor wrapped upon metaphor,"" says Garbus. ""It was as black and white as a chess board. Here was this lone American against this team from the Soviet Union who honed and nurtured their chess players. ""Even their names - Bobby and Boris - were quintessentially American and Russian."" In her documentary, Garbus explores the wider issues of whether Fischer was ever equipped to deal with the pressures of fame. The film also highlights the thin line between genius and madness. ""We have seen over time that starting incredibly young or being in a relentless spotlight is an enormous burden for an individual,"" says Garbus. ""Rather than chess making Bobby insane, chess is what kept Bobby sane. That drive to be world champion kept him organised, so when he achieved it that order was lost."" During the documentary Fischer is described as ""the Mozart of chess"". In 1958, at the age of 15, he became the youngest chess Grand Master in history. Raised by his mother in Brooklyn, he had taught himself to play chess aged six. As archive footage shows, he appeared regularly on TV throughout the 1960s. Radio rants But his increasingly erratic behaviour at the Spassky tournament in 1972 was an indicator of how his life would spiral out of control. His later years were marked by anti-Semitic rants, despite the fact that both his parents were Jewish. As part of her research Garbus and her team trawled through recordings of Fischer's calls to radio shows from the 1990s onwards. ""It's one thing if you listen to someone ranting about 9/11 or the Jews for five minutes. It's another if you listen to them for 200 hours,"" she says. ""You realise this is not a thoughtful ideological position, this is like a train that's going with no brakes on."" Garbus became fascinated with the Bobby Fischer story when she read his obituary on a flight to Utah for the Sundance film festival. Fischer died in Iceland in 2008 at the age of 64. He had been granted Icelandic citizenship in 2005 as a way to avoid being deported to the US. He was wanted for breaking international sanctions by playing a rematch with Spassky in the former Yugoslavia in 1992. ""I became obsessed and starting reading up on him - and I was at Sundance so I was all jazzed up creatively,"" Garbus says. She spent a year trawling for material in ""a scavenger hunt around the globe"". One of her best finds was photographer Harry Benson and a trove of previously unseen shots of Fischer taken for Life magazine, including a toned young Fischer working out in the gym. ""Looking at footage of Bobby as a young man you see how charismatic and good-looking he was,"" says Garbus. ""He really seemed to inhabit that rock star role for a time."" Bobby Fischer Against the World is released in the UK on 15 July",A documentary on the life of chess genius Bobby Fischer opens in cinemas this week. Its director Liz Garbus explains the challenges of telling the story of a child prodigy who turned controversial recluse.
"The movie/TV distributor has alleged the US film director's comments about the #MeToo movement ""sabotaged"" its attempts to promote his movies. Allen is suing the company, claiming it abandoned a four-film deal amid resurfaced allegations he molested his adopted daughter. He strongly denies the accusations, which first emerged in 1992. The 83-year-old is claiming more than $68m (£52 million) in damages, alleging a breach of contract after Amazon Studios failed to release A Rainy Day In New York. However, in a response filed on Wednesday, the company asked a New York judge to reject portions of the case, saying it went into a deal with Allen in August 2017, two months before allegations against movie producer Harvey Weinstein sparked a wider backlash against alleged abuse in the entertainment industry. Allen then ""made a series of public comments suggesting that he failed to grasp the gravity of the issues or the implications for his own career,"" lawyers claim. Sabotage Allen reportedly expressed sympathy for Weinstein, then months later accused his daughter, Dylan Farrow of ""cynically using the #MeToo movement,"" when she repeated her allegations that her father had abused her. Those comments came as Amazon Studios were trying to promote another of his films, Wonder Wheel, ""effectively sabotaging those efforts,"" the company said. Amazon pointed out a number actors expressed their regret at working with Allen and stars including Rachel Brosnahan, Colin Firth and Michael Caine vowed never do so again. Allen was quoted as saying he ""should be the poster boy for the Me Too movement"" as despite having ""worked in movies for 50 years,"" and with ""hundreds of actresses,"" he has ""only (been) accused by one woman in a child custody case."" ""Understood in the broader context,"" said Amazon, ""Allen's actions and their cascading consequences ensured that Amazon could never possibly receive the benefit of its four-picture agreement (despite already having paid Allen a 10 million-dollar advance upon signing).

""We carefully considered a number of complaints that it was offensive for this programme to ask the audience 'are women ever to blame' in cases of rape,"" said an Ofcom spokesperson. ""We noted the panel did not say that rape victims were in any way responsible for the behaviour of their attackers; and the audience strongly concurred with the sentiment 'no means no' expressed by many on the panel. ""We found the panel discussion and references to an online poll were in line with audience expectations for this live panel programme, which often covers difficult topics.

"Overnight viewing figures revealed an average of 7.6 million tuned in to watch the 12th series launch, with new judges Rita Ora and Nick Grimshaw. The show dominated Saturday night TV, with nearly 40% of viewers tuning in. An average of 8.9 million people watched the opening episode on the same weekend last year. Last year, the talent show faced competition from BBC One's Doctor Who, with the newly arrived Peter Capaldi. This year, it was scheduled opposite the National Lottery: Five Star Family Reunion and Casualty, which achieved audience figures of 2.7 million and 4.1 million respectively. Figures show that the number of X Factor viewers peaked at 7.9 million, with a 39.9% share of the available audience - not including +1 figures which have yet to be released. The downturn in viewing numbers may come as a blow to judge Simon Cowell, who has been busy promoting his new line-up of judges, as well as presenters Olly Murs and Caroline Flack. X Factor has been given a thorough shake-up after ratings for last year's final dipped to a 10-year low. An average audience of 9.1 million tuned in to see Croydon's Ben Haenow win the contest, the lowest since Steve Brookstein's victory in 2004. Speaking ahead of this year's launch show, Cowell, 55, said the X Factor could easily beat BBC One rival Strictly Come Dancing in the ratings war, when that show begins. ""I'd hate to say yes, because I know what will happen if I say yes - it will come back and haunt me,"" he said.

"Disney, Netflix and WarnerMedia have all objected to the legislation, which would ban abortion after a foetal heartbeat can be detected. The so-called ""heartbeat bill"" has caused a furious backlash in Hollywood and led to calls for a boycott. Georgia makes billions of dollars from film and television productions. The state's bill seeks to make abortion illegal as soon as a foetal heartbeat is detectable. In most cases, this is at the six-week mark of a pregnancy - before many women even know they are pregnant. It is one of a number of states to pass abortion restrictions in the past year, but they are expected to face legal challenges. What have the media firms said? Bob Iger, the CEO of Disney says the law would make it ""difficult"" for the company to keep filming there. Blockbusters like Black Panther and Avengers: Endgame, were recently shot in the state, due to its generous tax breaks for film productions. However, Mr Iger said ""many people who work for us will not want to work there"" should the law go into effect. ""We will have to heed their wishes,"" he told Reuters. WarnerMedia meanwhile said it would reconsider Georgia ""if the new law holds"", after Netflix announced on Tuesday it would ""rethink"" its productions in the state should the law take effect. Earlier this week, Netflix said it would ""rethink"" its operations there with chief content officer Ted Sarandos explaining: ""We have many women working on productions in Georgia, whose rights, along with millions of others, will be severely restricted by this law,"" He said the streaming giant would ""work with the ACLU [American Civil Liberties Union] and others to fight it in court."" What about the actors? Meanwhile, stars including Amy Schumer, Ben Stiller, Christina Applegate, Laverne Cox and Alec Baldwin wrote to the governor saying they would ""do everything in our power to move our industry to a safer state for women"". Comedy actress and writer Kristen Wiig also confirmed to CNN that her new comedy had pulled out of filming in the state while the executive producers of a new Amazon show The Power said it was no longer scouting for filming locations in Georgia because of the controversial bill. Actor Jason Bateman, who stars in the Netflix show Ozark and in HBO's The Outsider, which are both currently filming in Georgia, told The Hollywood Reporter: ""I will not work in Georgia, or any other state, that is so disgracefully at odds with women's rights"". ""Right now we are watching it very carefully,"" said Disney's Bob Iger, adding he didn't ""see how it's practical for us to continue to shoot there."" Disney's prospective withdrawal would be a huge blow to the state. Recently, Disney's Marvel Studios filmed portions of both Black Panther and Avengers: Endgame in Georgia. Georgia - which offers up to 30% tax breaks - has become a magnet for film and TV productions, employing more than 90,000 people. 'Massive ramifications' Website Film LA analysed a sample of the 100 top-grossing feature films released at the US box office in 2017 and found Georgia was tied for second place, behind California, as a location with the UK, each with 15 films in the top 100 in 2017. British location manager Steve Mortimore has worked with both Disney and Netflix and scouted for films including World War Z, the forthcoming Wonder Woman sequel and Ridley Scott's All The Money in the World. He told the BBC the clash over Georgia's abortion law could have ""massive ramifications"". Aside from Georgia's generous tax breaks for filmmakers, he said, ""they have trained so many people to work in the industry, and so many experts have moved there who will have to move away again"". Speaking about Disney and Netflix's threats to pull out of Georgia entirely, he told the BBC: ""I'd be surprised if they went ahead and pulled out unless they had a plan B or C. ""Those big Marvel films, they need huge spaces, 100,000 to 150,000 sq ft sound stages with all the facilities and they are limited. I know that Europe is absolutely fully booked up, there isn't anywhere else"". In 2014, the British-based Pinewood studios opened Pinewood Atlanta, spanning 700 acres and providing 18 sound stages. It has declined to comment on the news reports, but Mortimore said it could be be ""very painful for them"". He claimed that London has now displaced Hollywood as the film industry's new capital, adding ""the space just isn't available, people are queuing to film [in the UK] for the next three or four years"". ""It's an opportunity for somewhere else,"" he said. ""Maybe LA can step in. They have huge TV productions but its a chance to stick their flag in the sand and say they are a major hub for movies again, which they lost to London.""

It is one of several US states to pass new, stricter laws on abortion, the latest being Louisiana.

"By Vincent DowdArts reporter, BBC News The ambitious tour will mark two anniversaries - 23 April 2016 is 400 years since the Bard's death. The events will also link in with the 450th anniversary of the playwright's birth next April. The Globe's artistic director Dominic Dromgoole called the event ""a thrill"". The theatre will spend two years touring the play to every country on the planet - almost 200 of them, ending on 23 April 2016. The hope is the same actors will perform the play worldwide, staying abroad for about two months at a time. When suggested to Dromgoole it might prove a daunting commitment for his cast, he disagreed. Easy choice ""People are knocking on the door already. What a thing to tell your grandchildren about one day. In many ways it's an actors dream,"" he said. The Globe production of Hamlet has already been seen in Germany and the US, amongst other countries, since 2011. ""It's very pared down and runs at about two and a half hours which is short for Hamlet. There's a cast of eight, taken from a group of 12 touring players in all,"" he said. ""We already know this production works in all sorts of venue - whether it's a charismatic national theatre with glistening chandeliers or a simple market square. Or just in a field. ""It's a slightly mad extension of our Globe to Globe project last year, when we had 37 Shakespeare plays in 37 different languages staged in London by companies from around the world. The contacts made last year are already proving crucial to deciding some of the places we'll visit."" Dromgoole said the choice of play was straightforward: ""Hamlet's a fantastically rich and various play. It can provoke or challenge or comfort or inspire. And it's funnier than people think. ""I imagine in Germany or the US we'll mainly have audiences who know the play well. But what a thrill to play to people meeting Hamlet for the first time - the same experience that Shakespeare had."" Ambitious project The artistic director added that although detailed planning is still to be done, he believed ""we'll hare through Europe pretty quickly, just doing one or two performances in each place - but even that's around 50 countries"". ""We're hoping to do the Caribbean mainly by boat - I can't deny it'll be tempting to slow the pace a bit. And the Pacific Islands will entail a lot of plane hopping,"" he said. ""I think a year in it'll be fascinating to see what barnacles have stuck to the production as it travels. It won't feel the same in Tuvalu as it did at Elsinore in Denmark. ""People associate Shakespeare with London and especially with the Globe. That's gratifying but in fact, his company toured a lot in England and it went abroad too. There was a touring circuit through the Low Countries into northern Germany and even to Poland. ""Perhaps four centuries ago Shakespeare, like us, found it doesn't always matter if the audience has imperfect English. There's the physicality of the performance and the relationships between the characters. People usually grasp the psychology quite easily."" Shakespeare's Globe opened in 1997, constructed a few minutes from the site of the original 1599 theatre. It receives no public subsidy so, financially, the new project is ambitious. Yet Dromgoole said he relished the discoveries the tour will bring, even if he'll be hearing about them from London. ""There's something extraordinary about putting drama before an audience abroad which has limited English. It X-rays the play. ""It's like you flash a light and suddenly you see what the bone-structure is like within. We'll benefit from this tour at least as much as our audiences.""",Shakespeare's Globe theatre is to take Hamlet to every nation on earth - including some which have never before seen a professional production of Shakespeare's tragedy.

Veteran comic actress Carol Channing agreed: ""She was beautiful and generous. It seems like only yesterday she was having lunch here at the house and we were discussing the possibility of working together in a new show.""

Reynolds had been at her son's house in Beverly Hills - apparently discussing the arrangements for Carrie Fisher's funeral - when she was taken ill. She was admitted to Cedars-Sinai Medical Centre suffering from breathing difficulties and her death was confirmed a few hours later. It is thought she suffered a stroke. Carrie Fisher, renowned for her role as Princess Leia in the Star Wars series, had died aged 60 the day before, after spending three days in a Los Angeles hospital. She never regained consciousness after suffering a massive heart attack on board a flight from London to Los Angeles on Friday. Speaking to the Associated Press news agency about his mother, Todd said: ""She's now with Carrie and we're all heartbroken.'' Celebrity news site TMZ reported that Reynolds cracked while discussing plans for Carrie's funeral with her son, telling him: ""I miss her so much; I want to be with Carrie."" Can you die from a broken heart? By Stephen Evans, BBC News Some people talk about ""broken heart syndrome"", known more formally as stress cardiomyopathy or takotsubo cardiomyopathy. According to the British Heart Foundation, it is a ""temporary condition where your heart muscle becomes suddenly weakened or stunned. The left ventricle, one of the heart's chambers, changes shape."" It can be brought on by a shock. ""About three quarters of people diagnosed with takotsubo cardiomyopathy have experienced significant emotional or physical stress prior to becoming unwell,"" the charity says. This stress might be bereavement but it could be a shock of another kind. There are documented cases of people suffering the condition after being frightened by colleagues pulling a prank, or suffering the stress of speaking to a large group of people. It's speculated that the sudden release of hormones - in particular, adrenaline - causes the stunning of the heart muscle. This is different from a heart attack, which is a stopping of the heart because the blood supply is constricted, perhaps by clogged arteries. Read more here How does grief cause physical pain? Reynolds was leading lady in a succession of major Hollywood musicals and comedies in the 1950s and 60s. She rose to stardom with Singin' in the Rain, at the age of only 19. She received a best actress Academy Award nomination for the 1964 musical The Unsinkable Molly Brown. Her other films included 1973 animated film Charlotte's Web, in which she provided the voice for the eponymous spider. In 2015 she was given a lifetime achievement award by the Screen Actors Guild. The award was presented to her by her daughter. Reynolds married singer Eddie Fisher in 1955 and had two children, Carrie and Todd. The couple divorced in 1959 after news emerged of his affair with movie star Elizabeth Taylor. Reynolds married twice more. The actress has a sometimes strained relationship with her actress daughter, who wrote about it in her semi-autobiographical novel Postcards from the Edge. The pair stopped speaking to each other for many years but became closer later in life. In an interview last month with US radio network NPR, Fisher said her mother was ""an immensely powerful woman"" whom she admired ""very much"". As people gathered to pay their respects to the actress at Hollywood's Walk of Fame, one couple, Jose and Daniela Barrera, appeared to speak for many after a year marked by celebrity deaths. ""It's just, you know, a sad time I guess,"" Jose told the Reuters news agency. ""With the closing of the year and so many deaths in the year, it's just sad."" ""It was so sad,"" added Daniela. ""It was a shocker. I mean, what were the odds of this happening? It was incredible finding out, sad.""","Debbie Reynolds, who starred opposite Gene Kelly in the 1952 musical Singin' in the Rain, has died a day after the death of her daughter, Carrie Fisher."
"By Tim MastersEntertainment and arts correspondent, BBC News Norris plans to finish the film this year before he takes over from Sir Nicholas Hytner as the National's artistic director in April 2015. ""It's a bit of a double whammy at the moment,"" Norris told the BBC. ""In a week I go into prep for my next film. So I'm trying to balance the two - which is keeping me up at night."" London Road, which Norris directed at the National Theatre in 2011, is about the community in Ipswich where five prostitutes were murdered in 2006. It features writer Alecky Blythe's recorded interviews with the people of Ipswich set to Adam Cork's music. After a string of five-star reviews the musical was revived at the National in 2012. Norris said casting for the film was under way but it was too early to make any announcements. ""We're looking for actors who can sing without a doubt,"" he said at the London Critics' Circle Film Awards on Sunday. ""The music of London Road is not like you would imagine in a musical. ""It involves a huge amount of craft, but not a huge pair of lungs. It's the musical discipline rather than years of belting it out on the West End stage that we need."" Norris said that filming would take place ""within the M25"" rather than in Ipswich ""for all sorts of practical reasons"". ""The actual residents involved in the film are all very much behind it - otherwise we wouldn't be able to do it,"" he went on. ""We are quoting them word for word so we need permission for every phrase of that. ""It will inevitably waken the whole debate up again, because it was a very deep tragedy and a lot of people's lives were affected by it."" Having initially trained at Rada as an actor, Norris has directed theatre in the West End and on Broadway and also has experience with opera and film. He recently directed The Amen Corner at the National and created Dr Dee: An English Opera with Blur frontman Damon Albarn for the Manchester International Festival in 2011. He made his first foray into film in 2009 with King Bastard, a short film about a young girl's grief for her grandfather. His first feature Broken, which starred Tim Roth, Rory Kinnear and newcomer Eloise Laurence, premiered at Cannes in 2012 and was named best film at that year's British Independent Film Awards.",Future National Theatre boss Rufus Norris has revealed he is about to start work on the film version of hit stage musical London Road.
"Jackson's family is suing AEG for wrongful death, claiming the company was responsible for the star's death in 2009 because it hired Dr Conrad Murray. Dr Murray was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in 2011. A jury of six men and six women has been selected for the Los Angeles trial, which may last up to six months. Jackson died from an overdose of the powerful anaesthetic propofol while preparing for 50 comeback gigs in the UK. The legal action claims AEG Live is liable for his death because Dr Murray supplied Jackson with the surgical drug. 'Preposterous' The Jackson family is suing for $40bn (£26bn). But AEG Live has said it was not responsible for the hire or supervision of the doctor and called the $40bn claim ""preposterous"". Potential witnesses include Jackson's mother, his two oldest children, Prince, 16, and Paris, 15, as well as the singers Prince and Diana Ross. The jury was selected from more than 100 candidates - many of whom were eliminated because they said serving on a three-month trial would be a hardship. Others were rejected when they said they had a bias against Jackson or disapproved of big-figure legal cases or had business ties to AEG or the Jackson family. Alternative jurors Lawyers for both sides have now begun questioning prospective candidates to sit as six alternative jurors - used to replace a regular juror who becomes unable to serve. The legal action accuses the promoters of failing to check the credentials of Dr Murray, who supplied Jackson with the propofol. During Dr Murray's trial in 2011, the prosecution said he caused the star's death through negligence. The defence argued that Jackson was a drug addict who caused his own death by giving himself an extra dose of propofol while the cardiologist was out of the room. Earlier this week, Murray launched an appeal against his conviction.","A civil trial in which Michael Jackson's family is suing concert promoters AEG is to begin on Monday, court officials have confirmed."
