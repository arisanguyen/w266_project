"Fourteen fire engines were sent to tackle the blaze, which affected a row of buildings on The Esplanade, in the early hours of Sunday. West Sussex fire service said some of the properties were derelict and the buildings were completely destroyed. Emergency teams were at the scene throughout Sunday and inspections by firefighters were due to continue throughout the night. Residents were evacuated to a leisure centre as crews faced ""difficult storm conditions"", the fire service said. Sussex Police said the fire broke out at Beach Restaurant and affected derelict buildings next to it. A police spokesman said a gas supply caught fire and had kept the flames going, but emphasised emergency teams were not dealing with a gas mains explosion. About 30 residents were evacuated from flats close to the fire when crews were called just before 04:00 GMT. Fifty firefighters were involved in tackling the blaze at its height. Lead officer Adrian Murphy said: ""This incident has taken place in the midst of a major storm and it was difficult to stand when we arrived on the seafront. ""Our key priority now is to work with the displaced residents to get them safely home as soon as possible."" One person was treated for smoke inhalation but no other injuries were reported. The Esplanade remained closed at the junctions with West Street and Lennox Street and the closure was likely to remain in place throughout the day and potentially into the week, police said. The blaze is being investigated. Some local residents described the restaurant as selling the best fish and chips in Bognor. On Twitter, Paige posted: ""can't believe the best chippy in bognor has burnt down."" And Chris Jennings wrote: ""My favourite chip restaurant has burned down in Bognor Regis. It's safe to say 2016 has not been a good year.""","A ""major"" fire on Bognor Regis seafront has been brought under control."
"The 240-turbine Atlantic Array would be double the size of any windfarm currently operating in Britain. The EC confirmed it is taking up the matter with the UK Government due to the ""failure to propose protection sites for the harbour porpoise"". A Defra spokesperson they were working to identify further sites. A letter from Gunter Raad, acting head of environment directorate of the European Commission, said they had received a ""wide-ranging complaint"". ""As a result of our investigations we have now decided to follow this matter up with infringement action,"" the statement said. Mr Raad said the EC was now waiting for a reply from the relevant UK authorities. 'Extensive survey' The EC raised their concerns following a World Wildlife Fund (WWF) report into the delay to designate sites as Special Areas of Conservation, which identifies six possible sites around the UK for the protection of harbour porpoise. The EC warned that the delay has meant that potentially damaging activities are being allowed to progress, potentially without sufficient regard to the needs for the protection of the species. Developer RWE npower said in a statement: ""We have carried out extensive ecological survey work, site investigations and consultation. ""The results and findings have helped shape the development of the wind farm design which we have taken forward into the application. ""Detailed assessment of potential impacts upon marine mammals conclude the proposed wind farm would have no significant adverse effects on Harbour Porpoise."" A Defra spokesperson said: ""We are working to identify further sites to protect this important species in line with EU requirements."" A number of measures had already been taken, they said, ""including introducing measures to prevent accidental entanglement in fishing nets"". Joanne Bell, spokesperson for campaigners Save Our Marine Mammals, said: ""There are a massive amount of harbour porpoises in the Bristol Channel. ""We've been told the EC is taking infringement orders against the UK government, because they believe, as we do, they haven't done enough to protect the porpoises. They haven't designated any special areas of conservation."" The scheme, which would see the 220-metre high turbines built nine miles (16km) off the North Devon coast, was rejected by North Devon Council earlier this month. However Torridge's District Council planning committee voted not to oppose the Atlantic Array. Now independent councillor Chris Leather has put forward a new motion, calling on the council not to support the project. That motion is due to be debated by the full council on 23 September. The proposal will be considered by the Government's Planning Inspectorate, which is responsible for deciding large-scale infrastructure projects.",The European Commission (EC) has launched an investigation into whether a major windfarm off the Devon coast could endanger wildlife.
"It's the first time a rap song has won both categories - although Gambino did not attend or perform at the event. He was the first artist to be absent from collecting one of the ""big four"" Grammys since Amy Winehouse in 2008. Gambino - aka actor Donald Glover - beat competition from Drake, Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper in both categories. Kendrick Lamar and SZA's All The Stars, Brandi Carlile's The Joke and The Middle by Zedd, Maren Morris and Grey were also up for both awards. This Is America, which was accompanied by a symbolic music video, sparked debate when it was released in May. It looked at the representation of black people in America and the prejudices they faced. While record of the year recognises everyone involved in a song, including the artist, producers and engineers, song of the year is awarded to the writer. This Is America co-writer Ludwig Goransson collected the awards on Gambino's behalf. He said he did not know why Gambino had declined to attend but explained how important recognising rap and hip-hop artists at the Grammys was. ""I think if you listen to the radio or if you just watch our culture, if you look at the most downloaded, streamed artists... you see what people are getting inspired by,"" said Goransson backstage. ""It's about time that something like this happened with the Grammys. They're getting the same kind of senses as the people."" In addition to song of the year and record of the year, This Is America won awards for best music video and best rap/sung collaboration. Rapper 21 Savage, one of the collaborators on the track, was unable to attend the ceremony because he is being detained by US officials over an expired visa.

"By Eleanor Gruffydd-JonesBBC Politics Wales AM Angela Burns and the charity UK Sepsis Trust said help for survivors was non-existent. They want patients to be given more information when they are discharged and follow-up help with their recovery. More than 10,000 people get sepsis each year in Wales and about 2,000 of them die, the charity said. People get sepsis when the body attacks itself in response to an infection. Many recover within 18 months, but some suffer serious long-term physical and psychological problems - associated with what is known as ""post-sepsis syndrome"". The UK Sepsis Trust says these include post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, depression, insomnia, poor mobility, fatigue and muscle wasting. Mrs Burns, who speaks on health matters for the Conservatives in the Welsh Assembly, contracted sepsis when she had pneumonia. After being discharged, she said she there was no help for the psychological effects. ""You are very alone. I didn't have any support, I didn't understand, what was going on, and I had never really in my life suffered depression, so that was a new thing for me. ""I know sepsis survivors who have woken up and had their limbs amputated. ""It's like being in a massive road traffic accident where your entire life was turned completely upside-down,"" she said. Mrs Burns said her GP was not told she'd had sepsis, and she needed counselling. ""It was just a rollercoaster ride - I was blindfolded and I had no idea,"" she said. Mrs Burns still has memory loss, fatigue and lower immunity. Terence Canning, from the UK Sepsis Trust, said NHS support for sepsis survivors across Wales ""isn't existent"". ""I think because sepsis is relatively new in terms of health care. It certainly doesn't have the aftercare that, say heart attacks, strokes, cancer would have. It just isn't there for them,"" he said. ""I think early follow-up appointments would be really useful or basic signposting on discharge, even to a charity like Sepsis Trust or support groups, so people can access support early."" Mrs Burns wants patients to be given information packs and GPs to be notified. 'You leave hospital after having sepsis and you get nothing' Cardiff dad Chris Toozer, 45, contracted sepsis twice after stomach and bowel surgery in 2016 and 2017. ""I had PTSD, severe anxiety, weight loss, lots of vitamin deficiencies, and other problems,"" he said. ""Out of desperation I Googled it and found the Sepsis Trust website and I spoke to the nurses there. ""It was the first time in months that I thought, it isn't me feeling thinking all this, this is actually real. ""I started going to the support group meetings then and that's when I found out about post-sepsis syndrome. ""You leave hospital after having sepsis and you get nothing."" The Welsh Government said: ""We are supporting the development of the sepsis registry - led by Public Health Wales in collaboration with all health boards - which focuses on long-term outcomes for people who have had sepsis. ""The first phase of this work will be completed this summer.""","Support from the Welsh NHS after sepsis was like being on a rollercoaster ""blindfolded"", a Tory politician who survived the illness has said."
The six-week-old male bird was found at Loch Arkaig in Lochaber. The Scottish SPCA first took the chick to Inverness and then to its national rescue centre in Alloa for treatment. It will remain with the animal charity until it fledges at about 12-weeks-old and will then be released near the loch. The hooks were removed during a surgical procedure.

"By Gerry HoltBBC News Sometimes seen as a ""working-class gong"", the BEM was founded in 1917 and was awarded for ""meritorious"" actions whether by civilians or military personnel. But the honour was scrapped in 1993 by former Conservative Prime Minister John Major, as part of his drive towards a ""classless"" society. However, nearly two decades on, the prime minister has announced its revival, and from next year, to coincide with the Queen's Diamond Jubilee, about 300 will be awarded annually to community volunteers. The families of those who received the honour the first time round have welcomed the move - as long as it remains the ""unsung heroes"" who are recognised. 'Unexploded bomb' Mabel Siddal was honoured with the medal for her bravery as a 22-year-old air raid warden in Devonport, Plymouth, during World War II. She pulled survivors from devastated homes during the Blitz - even as attacks continued around her. The citation for her award, which she received in 1942, states: ""Madam, I recently drew the attention of the Minister of Home Security to your gallant conduct when during the severe air raids on Plymouth and district on the nights of 21, 22 and 29 April 1941 you rescued people from bombed houses while raiding was still going on, fought fires, evacuated a number of people from the area where an unexploded bomb had fallen, and generally behaved in a resourceful and courageous manner in circumstances of great danger with complete disregard for your own comfort and safety."" Her daughter Barbara Roche described her mother's actions as ""amazing"" and said the BEM had been a source of great pride. Mrs Siddal died last year at the age of 92. Mrs Roche welcomed the revival of the honour, but added: ""As long as it goes back to the concept of it being an award for services to the community, which very much was the case for my mum, then I have no problem with it. ""I think it had become devalued before it was abolished - the prime example was that it was given to Margaret Thatcher's cleaner, according to the newspapers, and mum was really irate about that."" Armed terrorists Douglas Hogg's story is as equally hair-raising as that of Mrs Siddal's. As a young young police officer in the Royal Ulster Constabulary during the late 1960s, he chased a gang of armed terrorists from Northern Ireland into the Republic of Ireland. The terrorists had previously robbed two banks in the town - now city - of Newry, County Down. ""I was unarmed at the time and I was briefly captured by them and made to plead for my life,"" explained Mr Hogg, who told how the men held a gun to his head. He was only saved after some children passed by and he pleaded with his assailants not to kill him until they had gone. They later let him go. Mr Hogg said of the honour: ""Being 24 years of age it is not often that you get a gallantry medal presented by the Queen."" He said he was surprised when the BEM was abolished, and added: ""I think people got the impression then - wrongly or rightly - that to receive an MBE you needed 'greater qualifications'."" He said bringing back the BEM was an ""excellent idea"" because it offered an opportunity for more people to receive a bravery medal. A search through the BBC News archives throws up many tales of local heroes who received the BEM. Take Henry ""Shrimp"" Davies, a lifeboatman who saved about 500 lives during more than 30 years as coxswain of the Cromer lifeboat. He was awarded the medal in 1970 for ""maintaining the highest traditions of the lifeboat service"". Margaret Miller was recognised with the BEM for services to her community through volunteering for more than 70 years. She began working with the WRVS, helping older people remain active and independent in the community, in Glasgow in 1939. Dale Howting, a former postman, who cycled hundreds of miles on the same spot in Roman Square, Sittingbourne, was honoured with the BEM for his charity work. Mr Howting raised more than £200,000 over 30 years. 'Very brave' William Craddy was awarded the BEM in 1946 for ""meritorious conduct"" during World War II. His son, also named William, said his father received the honour for an ""accumulation of acts of bravery, quick thinking, morale-raising and compassion"". ""In order to get any sort of medal an act of bravery performed needed to have been witnessed by an officer,"" says Mr Craddy, 63, from Leeds, whose father died aged 76 in 2004. ""Now that never happened with my dad although from the various stories told about him (we knew) he was an extremely brave man. ""He never got a medal other than the campaign medals but at the time we lived in a small village called Ormesby and the local people there gathered some stories about my dad and they passed them all to the Lord Lieutenant. He recommended my father for the BEM and it was awarded in 1946."" Mr Craddy recounted several of the stories that led to his father, who became an RAF sergeant, being honoured. ""The regiment was on a forced march in wet, muddy, terrible conditions and had marched for miles and miles. One of the men said to my dad 'Christ, sarge, how much further? I'm walking on my knees', to which my father replied: 'Never mind your knees, I'm walking on my cap badge'. This comment caused much laughter and being overheard by an officer, earned my dad a Mention in Despatches for keeping up morale,"" said Mr Craddy. Mr Craddy, a father-of-five, also pulled the body of one of his comrades to safety on the door of a cow shed after he was fatally shot by a sniper close to a German airfield. And on another occasion he saved lives when his regiment was trapped at one end of a German minefield. ""He remembered from a commando course that the Germans used a particular network of ropes to mark out mines and everywhere there was a knot there was a mine - he quickly told the commanding officer that he knew the pattern,"" said Mr Craddy. The former steel worker did not even mention that he had received the honour until the 50th anniversary of VE day. ""I'm not saying he was exceptional - he only did what thousands of other men probably did - but he was a very, very brave man,"" said his son. ""That's exactly what the BEM was for and yes, bring it back so the many unsung heroes of today can be recognised.""","After Prime Minister David Cameron announced the return of the British Empire Medal (BEM), we tell the stories of some of the local heroes who were honoured the first time round."
"By Tara JohnBBC News Condolences flooded social media from journalists, businessmen academics, ambassadors and even flag-carrying Ethiopian Airlines after it was reported that Mr Simegnew's body was found in a car in the capital, Addis Ababa, on Thursday. The police are investigating the circumstances of his death. He died as a result of a bullet wound and a hand gun was found in his car, which was parked in Meskel Square in the city centre. By the afternoon, hundreds had taken to the streets in the capital, as well as Mr Simegnew's hometown of Gondar, with protesters demanding ""justice"" for the late engineer. To understand why a project manager has managed to elicit such shock and widespread mourning - normally seen in other countries after the death of royalty, celebrities or politicians - one has to look at what the Grand Ethiopian Dam has come to represent. 'Patriotic ambitions' Straddling the Nile, the dam has been called the most ambitious infrastructure project ever achieved on the continent. Once built, the 1.8km (1.1 mile) wide and 155m (500ft 5in) high dam will triple the country's electricity production. The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, which is set to be Africa's biggest hydropower plant, is one of a number of large-scale infrastructure projects aimed at putting Ethiopia on course to become a middle-income nation by 2025. Its scale and potential has brought rare unity in the country, which has faced political and ethnic strife over the years, Beletu Bulbula Sorsu, editor of BBC's Afaan Oromo Service, says. ""The project unites Ethiopians,"" she says. Matina Stevis-Gridneff, Africa correspondent for the Wall Street Journal who knew Mr Simegnew, says he has come to represent these patriotic ambitions. ""He was someone who was extremely patriotic and had devoted his life to the betterment of his country,"" she told the BBC'S Focus on Africa radio programme. ""He seemed to have devoted his entire life to Ethiopia's future by contributing what he could, which was his engineering skills."" Not a 'big man' The 53-year-old gained his degree in civil engineering from Addis Ababa University and went on to to lead two other dam projects - Gilgel Gibe I and Gilgel Gibe II dams. He came to the public's attention in 2011, when he was put in charge of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam. Ms Beletu says he was frequently interviewed by the press and was widely perceived as being uncorrupted, modest and accessible. ""He was not a 'big man,'"" she says of Mr Simegnew's honest nature. ""He behaved as if he was one of the the labourers working on the project."" Read more Tibebeselassie Tigabu, from the BBC's Amharic Service, interviewed Mr Simegnew days before he died. ""He gave his life for the dam,"" she says, explaining that he spent most of his time around the dam, which was located in Ethiopia's Benishangul-Gumuz region near Sudan, nearly 1,000km north-west of his home in Addis Ababa. ""It is a difficult place to live and he had been there for more than six years,"" she adds. A man of symbols Mr Simegnew became the symbol of the dam and his death might become emblematic of the problems facing the project. ""He was the spokesman for the project, he was the front man and I am not sure how that will be replaced so easily,"" Ms Stevis-Gridneff says. The dam is believed to be 60% complete, but there has been growing anger over delays. In the last week of July, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said that at the current pace of construction the dam might not be completed in the next 10 years. Ethiopians are proud of the fact that the dam is a largely self-financed project. But a dollar shortage crisis has slowed down its construction, Ms Stevis-Gridneff says. Then there is geopolitical tension the dam has created downstream with Egypt worried that the infrastructure project will put a strain on its water supply. ""While the project is coming into trouble for practical reasons, I also see his death as a real blow to the symbolism of this project and how it was recorded in the psyche of normal Ethiopians,"" she says. Mr Simegnew was expected to be buried a day after his death. But a statement by a national committee set up to organise his funeral said it had postponed the burial. They have instead made arrangements for a bigger funeral on Sunday 29 July ""that a national hero like him deserves"".","The death of Simegnew Bekele, the project manager of the multi-billion-dollar Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, has been met by an outpouring of grief in Ethiopia."
"Haniffa Bin Osman, 57, was sentenced to 37 months in prison by the district judge in Baltimore on Friday. He was accused of aiding the LTTE in the attempted purchase of Surface to Air Missiles, Night Vision of Devices, Machine Guns and State of the Art Firearms. The attempts were made from April to September 2006 together with Haji Subandi, Erick Wotulo and Thirunavukarasu Varatharasa, a statement by the US Justice Department said. Three others sentenced ""Haniffa Bin Osman conspired with others to provide material support to the Tamil Tigers, a designated foreign terrorist organization, and attempted to illegally export arms,"" US Attorney Rod J Rosenstein was quoted in the statement. Haniffa Bin Osman has told US undercover agents in July 2006 that the weapons were to be sent for the use by the LTTE who are fighting against the Sri Lankan forces. ""On August 1, 2006, Osman told the undercover agents that the Tamil Tigers wired a deposit of $250,000 as a down payment for the purchase of the weapons. Indeed, the next day $250,000 was wired from Malaysia to an undercover bank account in Maryland,"" the statement said. The United States designated the LTTE as a Foreign Terrorist Organization in1997. The LTTE is also banned as a terrorist outfit in India, Canada and within the EU. Thirunavukarasu Varatharasa, a Sri Lankan, Subandi, an Indonesian national, Wotulo, 60, an Indonesian and a retired Indonesian Marine Corps General were already imprisoned in the US for their parts in the operation.",A court in the United States has sentenced a Singapore national for conspiring to provide material support to Sri Lanka's Tamil Tigers.
"Robert PestonEconomics editor One reason why this bank should stay afloat is because Co-op Group is injecting £462m into it. But even so, Co-op Group will emerge with a holding in the bank of just 30%. Or to put it another way, the value of its current 100% ownership of the bank is being valued at a big fat zilch. This destruction of Co-op Group's investment in the bank stems from a merger with Britannia Building Society in 2009 that has spewed losses, massive wasted investment in IT and from not generating enough profit out of the better operations to meet regulators' requirements for the capital it needs as a buffer against potential future losses. If the rescue happens, the remaining 70% of Co-op Bank will henceforth be held by hedge funds and other investors. Their £942m of loans to the group - or more precisely, their holdings of bonds classified as ""lower tier 2 capital"" under the Basel classification (stay with me!) are being converted into shares. And they are also putting £125m of cash into the bank. Oh my goodness, hedge funds in charge of the UK's most ethical bank! Whatever next? Well the hedgies - led by Aurelius, Silver Point and Monarch - insist they are not on a mission to turn Co-op Bank into just any old bank, or worse - unless, that is, any old bank wouldn't spill red ink on the scale of the Co-op in recent years (err yes, any old bank has done that too). The important point is that the professional investors don't want to lose any or all of Co-op Bank's staggeringly loyal 4.7 million customers, who have stuck with the group through all the uncertainties about its future in recent months, but might take their money and custom elsewhere if Co-op Bank decided not to be very co-operative and moral in future. So as part of the deal to save the bank, its constitution or articles of association are being rewritten, to state that it must behave ethically. A new independent committee, reporting to the bank's board, will be the guardian of this ethical culture. And Co-op Group will have the right to strip the bank of the ""Co-op"" moniker if it starts lending money to clubbers of seal pups or in any other way doesn't behave as its customers would want. But to be clear, Co-op Group is not yet saved. For the rescue to be formalised, its creditors must vote for it - and the logistics of securing their approval are horribly complicated. On the plus side, the hedgies controlling 48% by value of the lower tier 2 capital have said yes. But what's actually required of those creditors is an assent from 75% by value and just over 50% by number. There also have to be three separate votes of holders of the upper tier 2 capital, and they include up to 18,000 retail investors, many of whom are not experienced or sophisticated investors. Herding them will not be easy - and yet two-thirds of them must vote and 75% by value must vote in favour for the rescue to take effect. In theory, those retail investors - who have been represented by the financial campaigner Mark Taber - have got a deal closer to what they wanted than Co-op Group's initial proposal. Back then they were being offered shares in the bank. But this horrified many of them, who had come to depend on the fat interest being paid on their preference shares and perpetual subordinated bonds (known as pibs). So Co-op Group is now offering them a couple of options: the chance to receive a decent tax-free income for 12 years, but with no repayment of principal at the end of the 12 years, or an immediate write-off of between 15% and 40% of the value of the bonds and a continuing interest payment of 11% on what's left. Mr Taber tells me he is happy with what Co-op has now put on the table, but he concedes that it will be hard work securing the requisite majorities. Co-op Group is putting pressure on creditors to agree in two different ways. First, it is saying the upper tier two creditors - who comprise the bulk of the ordinary or retail investors - will get 8% less if they don't agree to the terms before 16:30 GMT on 29 November. And it has today formally told all creditors that the alternative to this rescue is resolution or takeover by the Bank of England. Here's Co-op being less cuddly than is its wont: ""If the Bank were to enter into a bank insolvency or administration procedure following resolution, all holders of the existing securities would receive no recovery at all."" Now Co-op would not have issued that warning to bondholders, that saying ""no"" would mean wipe-out, without consulting the Bank of England. Ouch. And one final thing. In an attempt to restore profits, Co-op Bank is closing around 50 branches, or around 15% out of 324. That will lead to many hundreds of job losses, maybe 1000. But don't blame supposedly ruthless hedge funds for that. The Co-op had already embarked on that cost-cutting exercise (10 of the 50 branches have already gone). The new management of the group, in place for just six months, inherited the kind of mess where the survival of the bank required them to behave in a less co-operative way than they might have liked.","It is a humiliating day for Co-op Group, or at least its previous management, because there is confirmation in today's rescue deal for Co-op Bank that the value of the bank has collapsed to nothing."

"By Andrew PickenBBC Scotland News New figures from the administrator of the yard show £49.7m is owed to the Scottish government - nearly £5m more than previously revealed. A total of £426,000 is also owed to HMRC. The Scottish government said it provided two commercial loans totalling £45m to Ferguson Marine, on which interest applies. The new figures also reveal that two partially-built CalMac ships at the centre of the firm's collapse have been valued at £48.3m. That is nearly half the value of the £97m deal agreed to build the ships. BBC Scotland understands that a number of bids have been received for the yard with an update from the administrator Deloitte expected within the next week. Ferguson went into administration following a dispute with Caledonian Maritime Assets Ltd - which buys and leases CalMac ships on behalf of the Scottish government - over the construction of two new ferries. The shipyard is operating under a management agreement with administrators, which will see the Scottish government buy Ferguson if no private buyer comes forward. A ""statement of affairs"" produced by Deloitte shows the estimated total assets available for Ferguson Marine is £97.7m, including a £48.3m estimated value for the partially built two CalMac vessels. Ferguson Marine went bust owning more than £73m. Further details from the document show that: 'Catastrophically wrong' Jamie Greene, Scottish Conservative transport spokesman, said report outlined ""just how desperate the finances of the yard are"". ""A full parliamentary inquiry is essential to get to the bottom of why the SNP let things go so catastrophically wrong at Ferguson Marine and come clean over the role they played in its demise,"" he added. A number of potential private buyers have expressed an interest in the Ferguson shipyard and Deloitte has now received bids for the yard, but has not said how many. The monthly wage bill for workers at the yard is being met from Scottish government funds and a new board has been put in place to come up with a plan to finish the delayed CalMac ferries. Economy Secretary Derek Mackay has said details of a ""robust delivery schedule"" for the vessels must be announced by the end of October. ""At all points the Scottish government has acted to ensure the completion of the ferry contracts, the protection of jobs and a future for the Ferguson ship yard and that remains our priority,"" a government spokeswoman said. ""The Scottish government provided two commercial loans totalling £45 million to FMEL on which interest applies."" A spokesman for Deloitte said: ""We received a number of offers which we are currently working through and discussions with interested parties, in respect of their bids, are ongoing.""",The taxpayer is owed more than £50m as a result of the collapse of ship building firm Ferguson Marine.
"By George PierpointBBC News The photograph was shared on a local Facebook group, with a caption stating it was ""just another reason... to leave Fayetteville"", along with an angry emoji. However, after it transpired the man was homeless and resting between working two shifts at the fast-food restaurant, the local community decided to offer support, rather than ridicule him. Local reporter Matt Johnson managed to track down the man, Simon Childs, who explained his mother had died recently and he had fallen on hard times. The 21-year-old added that he was raising his young son and trying to provide for his family. ""It kind of hurt to see my picture up there,"" he told WSB-TV. ""I thought it was something negative and nobody would care about it."" Mr Childs' situation spurred his local community to respond with kindness, by donating nappies and clothes for his son. ""I didn't think the community would even care enough to do that, but they care,"" he said. Two chefs from a nearby restaurant offered to loan Mr Childs a car. And a local barber gave him a free haircut in preparation for attending job interviews, Mr Childs told the local news station he had received job offers as a result of the Facebook post and was excited about finding a permanent home for him and his son. Many took to social media to criticise the woman's decision to shame Mr Childs on Facebook. ""It's not cool to shame someone,"" one person wrote. While others said the woman's plan to criticise Mr Childs had ""backfired"". The woman who shared the photo on Facebook told WSB-TV off-camera she had not intended to shame Mr Childs. Others sympathised with the difficulties faced by Mr Childs. One Twitter user wrote that they ""know how it feels to lose a mother and still [have to] deal with the rest of life"". ""You simply don't bring a person down when they are already down,"" they added. Mr Childs' experience is an example of ""stranger-shaming"", which involves posting photos or videos on social media to highlight a behaviour that one finds distasteful.

"Organisers of the event at Henham Park, Suffolk, said performances were paused on the Obelisk Arena Stage, the BBC Sounds Stage and the Lake stage, as a precaution. They were waiting for ""inclement weather to pass"" they said on Twitter. ""Lightning is the concern, not rain"" it said after people complained of delays. ""We are currently still awaiting any lightning around the festival to pass before we can safely resume performances. ""Thank you for your patience during this time"" it said. The power was back on by about 14:50 BST. Some festival goers on Twitter were unhappy. One said ""Sitting under clear skies. This is a joke"". Another and said: ""How can a festival shut down for half an hour over less than 5 mins rain?"" ""This is currently a music festival with no music"" said another. The event is now back up and running but Futureheads were unable to finish their set at the Obelisk Arena. ""All other set times on BBC Sound Stage will start a few minutes later than scheduled"", organisers said. The festival started on Thursday and runs until Sunday and attracts about 40,000 people. Acts on the bill include George Ezra, Stereophonics and Lana Del Rey and comedians Frank Skinner and Marcus Brigstocke.",Performances at the Latitude Festival were suspended for about an hour after lightning and heavy rain caused the power to be turned off.
"Enthusiasts recreated the original opening of the waterway in 1812 at Pontymoile Basin with church bells sounding along the route. The 49-mile, canal built to transport coal and iron, winds its way south from Brecon to Cwmbran, Newport and Cwmcarn. Today it is popular with tourists on canal boat holidays. At midday a bell was rung at Pontymoile Basin sparking a peal of church bells in both directions along the route with almost 30 churches taking part. Richard Dommett, regeneration manager for the Monmouthshire, Brecon and Abergavenny Canals Trust, said the canal was flourishing. ""The top half of the canal from Brecon to Cwmbran is open for navigation,"" he told BBC Radio Wales. ""There are a lot of canal companies that hire weekly holiday trips for visitors. ""There are also a number of day boat hires, particularly at Brecon."" The canal is credited with kick-starting the Industrial Revolution in towns near its route. Schoolchildren also performed at the anniversary celebrations. Project Co-ordinator David Morgan said: ""It is fantastic to see such great community engagement and involvement to help mark this historic occasion,"" David said.",Celebrations have been held to mark the 200th anniversary of the opening of the Monmouthshire and Brecon Canals.
"Former Labour parliamentary candidate Corrie Drew said he was homophobic and ""an enthusiastic supporter of Hitler"". The website Topple the Racists said he committed ""atrocities against the Zulus in his military career"". However, some historians have argued the allegations are either unfair or entirely unfounded. 'Nazi sympathies' In 2010, declassified MI5 files revealed that Baden-Powell held talks in 1937 with the head of the Hitler Youth movement and was invited to meet Adolf Hitler himself. Lord Baden-Powell's biographer Tim Jeal said any admiration for the Nazi leader was confined to their shared ideas about boys' education. The author said a diary entry in which Baden-Powell described Hitler's autobiographical manifesto Mein Kampf as a ""wonderful book"" had been misinterpreted. Mr Jeal said: ""It was all to do with the outward bound life - it was only these references to character-training that he found appealing, not Hitler's hatred of Jews. ""Baden-Powell condemned Hitler for being a megalomaniac and for mounting what he called 'huge pageants for hypnotising his people'. ""He hated totalitarianism, twice hoped that he would be able to marry Jewish women and chose a Jewish doctor."" Historian Dr Andrew Norman said the Nazis vowed to execute Baden-Powell in the event of a successful invasion of Britain. He said: ""He wanted to introduce the Scout movement into Germany to foster friendship between the two countries. ""His efforts were in vain, and for his pains he was put on a Nazi death list because the Germans suspected he was using scouts as spies."" 'War atrocities' Baden-Powell's exploits as an army officer in South Africa involved several controversial incidents. His early military career was clouded by an operation to track down Zulu rebels in 1888, which led to at least three deaths. Mr Jeal said: ""He lost control of his men who may well have committed murder. ""Even if he had given orders to spare the rebels' lives, it's incredibly unlikely that his Zulu mercenaries would have obeyed. ""A lot of trouble stemmed from this and he was lucky not to lose his career."" Baden-Powell was later accused of executing an African chief in 1897 who had been promised his safety in return for surrendering. Mr Jeal said: ""This is probably the most damaging charge made against Baden-Powell. ""White settlers were being murdered in a remote part of Matabeleland. Baden-Powell had orders to capture the chief, Uwini, thought to be responsible and suppress his rebellion. ""Because the chief was wounded during capture and Baden-Powell doubted he would survive a long journey to the Cape to face a civil court, he court-martialled him on the spot. ""The verdict was death, so he was shot. Baden-Powell had exceeded his orders."" At the turn of the century, Baden-Powell was acclaimed a hero for his defence of the South African town of Mafeking during the Second Boer War. His biographer said: ""The worst that is normally said about him is that he starved 2,000 black Africans in Mafeking and stole their food to feed the white population. ""This is an absolute lie. He opened soup kitchens and shot all of his cavalry horses so that he could feed them."" 'Romantic homosexual' Baden-Powell spoke of the dangers of being ""sentimental"" about boys. But Dr Norman said the Scouts founder was ""confused about his own sexuality"" and sometimes slept on a balcony to be away from his wife. Mr Jeal said: ""He was gay and repressed it. Men were beautiful to him but he was a romantic, not a practising, homosexual. ""If a scoutmaster was said to have either had a liaison with another master or was 'sentimental' about boys, he would remove them quietly, rather than call in the police. ""Everything he wrote about the attractiveness of men was in favour of a gay cause.""",A council has said it may temporarily remove a statue of Robert Baden-Powell from public view after critics accused the Scout movement founder of racism.
"By Sean CoughlanBBC News education correspondent The average fee level for 2014-15 will rise by about £150 to about £8,650. But the total amount to be spent on supporting poorer students will also rise to £708m, up from £672m. Offa director Les Ebdon said universities were spending ""increasingly smartly"". The fair access watchdog is publishing details of the fees that universities and colleges will charge in 2014-15 and how much they will spend on recruiting and retaining poorer students. Outreach work Before universities are allowed to charge fees above £6,000 per year, they have to sign an ""access agreement"" with Offa. These agreements show that 72% of universities are planning to charge the maximum £9,000 fee for some or all courses, compared with 62% the previous year. Offa's report says that 26% of this higher fee income will be spent on protecting fair access to university. This proportion of income is similar to the previous year, but the access watchdog argues that universities are becoming more effective in how they deploy their budgets for supporting poorer students. More money will be spent on outreach projects, where universities build links with schools and young people to encourage them to think about applying to university. This can include summer schools and visits to universities. ""Outreach work is key to addressing the unacceptably large participation gap that remains at the universities with the highest entry requirements, so I welcome the greater focus in this area,"" said Prof Ebdon. He said that universities were being more strategic in their spending and using ""evidence and evaluation"" to see what works in reaching ""students from under-represented backgrounds"". ""Expenditure on outreach and student support by universities in England has continued to rise and, crucially, is being invested in a focused and targeted way,"" said Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of Universities UK. ""These agreements demonstrate how universities remain committed to widening access and supporting student success."" But the National Union of Students highlighted that last month's spending review marked the end of the National Scholarship Programme as funding for undergraduates. The £150m scholarship fund for poorer students is to be cut to £50m and targeted at postgraduates. ""Money worries lead many students to consider dropping out of university and even the small payments from the National Scholarship Programme could be the difference between gaining a life changing qualification and leaving with nothing,"" said NUS vice president, Rachel Wenstone. Business Secretary Vince Cable said: ""The government is determined to encourage anyone with the ambition and ability to go to university, irrespective of their background. ""We now have the highest proportion ever of young people from disadvantaged backgrounds applying to university.""","Almost three-quarters of universities in England are planning to charge the maximum £9,000 tuition fee for some or all of their courses, according to Office for Fair Access (Offa) figures."

"It has acquired 187 patents and 36 applications, adding to the 1,000 it purchased from IBM last summer. The latest patents include a system for ""using semantic networks to develop a social network"". Google has spent billions building its technology rights portfolio, including a $12.5bn (£7.7bn) deal for Motorola Mobility. The California-based company has been actively bolstering its patent catalogue in the face of lawsuits from key competitors such as Apple and Microsoft. Among the patents acquired in this latest deal isUS Patent 7,865,592which relates specifically to social networking sites, allowing ""identifying common interests between users of a communication network"". Vicki Salmon, the chair of the litigation committee of the UK Chartered Institute of Patent Attorneys, believed this might be a nod that Google was moving from protecting existing technology and beginning to plan for the future. ""When you start you have to play catch-up,"" she told the BBC. ""When you've finished playing catch-up and you've got yourself in a stronger position, you then can begin to look forward."" Other patents included a method forusing web-based applications across additional devices, and an intriguingly titledcomputer phone. Neither Google nor IBM would comment on the deal when approached by the BBC. 'Get real' Last year, Google accused its competitors of buying up what it called ""bogus patents"" in order to slow the development of its Android operating system. However, the company now appears to have succumbed to the same approach as it adds the IBM patents to a portfolio that also includestechnology for driverless cars. ""Although you can object to a lot of cost of inconvenience by virtue of people enforcing their patents, the patent system still exists,"" Piers Strickland, a lawyer specialising in mobile telephone patent litigation, told the BBC ""In order to engage with that you've either got to take licences from from people's patents, and/or aggressively increase your bartering position by buying patents. ""I think they've realised that they just had to get real, and understand that you can't just ignore the system."" Google's agreement to buy Motorola Mobility,announced in August last year, includes 24,500 patents, many of which could be used to defend the use of features on its Android mobile operating system. The purchase is currently beingreviewed by competition regulators. 'Turf war' Google's Motorola move came off the back oflosing out on buying the 6,000-strong patent portfolioof bankrupt telecoms firm Nortel. It was outbid by a consortium of companies including Apple, Microsoft and Blackberry manufacturer Research in Motion. ""The reality is that you've got a fairly vicious turf war going on between the different operating systems,"" explained Ms Salmon. ""People want to be in there, and they want their platform established and people to be using them."" Google is just one of many technology companies involved in patent lawsuits which seek to slow down competition or strike lucrative licensing fee settlements. On Wednesday, US mobile operator AT&T was forced to pay Tivo - the digital video recorder specialist - $215m plus additional undisclosed monthly licensing fees. The fee will vary depending on AT&T meeting growth targets for digital video recording customers until 2018. ""No matter which projections you take, they all involve AT&T paying us significantly higher revenue than $215m,"" Tivo chief executive Tim Rogers said.",Google has gained hundreds of patents from IBM as it continues its intellectual property spending spree.
"By Jonathan BealeDefence correspondent, BBC News At this week's summit in Newport in Wales, Nato heads of state will agree on a Readiness Action Plan to respond to such crises. It will involve setting up a new spearhead force of 4-5,000 troops, ready to deploy within 48 hours. The alliance is also committed to boosting its intelligence gathering and sharing with the use of spy planes and unmanned drones. Swarm of drones Earlier this year, a US Military Global Hawk entered British airspace en route to Norway. It was the first time the highly secretive unmanned surveillance plane had flown over Britain. Few, if any, would have caught a glimpse of it at 15,240m (50,000 ft), well above the cruising altitude of passenger planes. Nor did many know what it was up to. The Global Hawk, whose powerful sensors can monitor every single traffic movement in the state of Florida while flying 100 miles (60 km) off the coast, was joining a swarm of other drones, as well as manned spy planes of all shapes and sizes, in the largest ever test of Nato's ability to gather and share intelligence. On the ground Nato troops were launching hand-held mini-drones, like the Raven, to give them live pictures of the land ahead. The trial, called Unified Vision, involved the use of four military satellites, 24 surveillance aircraft, 15 ground-based vehicles with sensors and radars, as well as two warships. US Global Hawks have already been used over Iraq to locate Islamic State fighters and their positions. They have also been flown over Nigeria to try to locate hundreds of Nigerian schoolgirls abducted by Boko Haram. By the end of the decade, Nato too will have acquired five of the high-altitude unmanned spy planes at a cost of $1.7bn (£1bn). They will be operated out of Sigonella airbase in Sicily and will help the alliance build up what it describes as its ""situational awareness"" in times of crises. It is just what Nato needs to develop a clear picture of the build-up of Russian forces on the border with Ukraine. Revolution in warfare? That is the kit, but the location for Unified Vision is close to nirvana for the international military alliance too. Situated in a remote Norwegian fjord with large stretches of uninhabited land, wide empty stretches of water and uncluttered airspace, it is the perfect place to put the technology through its paces. Its relative isolation also allows military planners to block GPS signals or launch cyber attacks to simulate the challenges of electronic warfare. Unlike most military exercises, the majority of the 2,000 military personnel involved in Unified Vision were staring at computer screens and live video feeds rather than through the sight of a rifle. ""Computers and computer technology are becoming part of the fabric of warfare,"" says Dr Richard Wittstruck, who leads Nato's Joint Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance group. ""As we look at a digital age, the soldier treats the computer as part of his weapon cache. It's as important as a tank or a rifle or any other weapon,"" he adds. Ludwig Decamps, the alliance's director of aerospace capabilities describes all this reliance on technology as ""an evolution in warfare"". It looks and feels more like a revolution. More than bombs The challenge for Nato, and the purpose of Unified Vision, is to make sure allies can use all the technology at their disposal and then share the intelligence gathered. It is no easy task. First the nations that make up Nato use different systems, from aircraft to software. Second, not everyone wants to share all the intelligence they collect. In Afghanistan it took Nato the best part of a decade to put systems in place that would allow all those countries involved to share intelligence. Lieutenant Colonel Matt Martin, the joint commander for Unified Vision, says it is vital to prepare for future operations. ""When a Nato campaign kicks off, you don't know who will show up and what they will bring,"" he says. This training is vital for ensuring there is a common set of procedures and systems in place under which they can all work and function together when the next crises arises. To do that, they rehearse a number of ""vignettes"", ranging from a humanitarian crisis and fleeing refugees to dealing with an insurgency, and even a full conflict. In one scenario, a French military analyst interprets the data coming in from a Czech listening station that has been trying to identify the location of a surface-to-air missile battery. The French analyst then passes on the intelligence to an Italian air commander who orders Norwegian F-16 to destroy the target. All this information is relayed to a nerve centre, or ""intelligence fusion cell"", where civilian and military intelligence personnel sift through the data and watch the live feeds from drones flying above. It has the potential to be a Tower of Babel; English is not the only language being spoken. Different software and systems have the potential to add to the confusion. Then there is the task of storing all this information on servers which can be accessed by the different nations taking part. This trial in Norway tried to iron out some of those challenges. It is also a reminder that the future of warfare is much more than just bombs and bullets.",The crisis in Ukraine has refocused minds at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (Nato) on the threat posed by Russia and the need to improve the alliance's collective defence capability.
"A spokesperson for Coutts International said both parties had agreed not to disclose the price of the deal. The bank has been owned by RBS since 2000, managing assets of more than $30bn (£20.2bn). The sale is part of RBS's policy of selling international assets to create a UK-focused bank. The Financial Times reported that UBP would pay between $600m and $800m for the business. 'Significant milestone' For Geneva-based private bank UBP, this is its first major deal since it bought Lloyds Banking Group's international private banking arm in May 2013. UBP's assets almost halved during the financial crisis. UBP's chief executive said in a statement: ""This acquisition confirms our commitment in further developing our wealth management business and represents a significant milestone in our growth strategy."" RBS will keep Coutts' UK arm, which has the British royal family amongst its customers. ""Last year we set out a clear strategy to create a truly UK-focused bank,"" said Alison Rose, chief executive of RBS's commercial and private banking unit. ""This announcement is another important step in that process. Following an extensive review, it was clear that the bank we are building would not be the most appropriate owner of the business being sold.""

"By Jonathan AmosBBC Science Correspondent The arrow-shaped racer clocked a speed of 461mph (741km/h) as it powered across a dried-out lakebed in southern Africa's Kalahari desert on Friday. This mark tops the 403mph (648km/h) recorded by Donald Campbell in his Bluebird CN7 car in 1964. The only British cars to have gone faster are Thrust2 and Thrust SSC which both got well above 600mph (965km/h). Thrust SSC still holds the absolute land speed record of 763mph (1,228km/h) set in 1997. The driver on that occasion was RAF pilot Andy Green. The Wing Commander is at the controls again in Bloodhound. His new car's mark can only be unofficial because it wasn't running under proper land speed record rules. These require a car to make two runs through a measured mile inside an hour. The recognised speed is then the average of the two passes. The racing must be overseen by world motorsport's governing body, the Federation Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). Nonetheless, Bloodhound is starting to demonstrate its potential as it sets its sights on bettering Thrust SSC's supersonic achievements. The Bloodhound car is conducting what are described as high-speed trials on Hakskeen Pan. Engineers are working through a series of tests to verify the vehicle's design and the proper working of its subsystems. With a Eurofighter jet engine onboard, it ought to be capable of reaching 500-600mph (800-965km/h) this year. The addition of a rocket motor in 2020 might then see Bloodhound thunder past 800mph (1,290km/h). Friday's outing was the car's fifth run across the desert, intended to examine its stability and brake chute performance. A further Friday run was abandoned when the crosswinds started to gust beyond acceptable limits. Donald Campbell's speed of 403mph was set on Kati Thanda-Lake Eyre, the huge salt pan in central Australia. It was the last official mark to hold the land speed record with a wheel-driven vehicle. All subsequent records have been set by jet or rocket-powered cars. Bloodhound is using a Rolls-Royce EJ200 turbofan to get itself rolling and to accelerate through the lower hundreds mph. A monopropellant rocket from the Norwegian Nammo company, when it's hung below the jet next year, should enable Bloodhound to punch through the sound barrier and attack Thrust SSC's world record. The Bloodhound project is led from the UK but is being hosted by the Northern Cape government. Local people have cleared Hakskeen Pan of stones. The hope is this flat lakebed can become a draw for other racers in the future.",The Bloodhound vehicle has become the third fastest British car of all time - unofficially.
"By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter ""If anything kills over 10 million people over the next few decades, it is likely to be a highly infectious virus rather than war,"" he told the audience. His prescient words picked up some coverage at the time, including from the BBC - but largely went unheeded. But now, the video of this talk has now been viewed more than 64 million times - with many people more interested in the reasons behind that speech than the talk itself. Some accuse of him of leading a class of global elites. Others believe he is leading efforts to depopulate the world. Still more accuse him of making vaccines mandatory, or even attempting to implant microchips into people. The face of public health ""There are myriad conspiracies surrounding Bill Gates,"" said Rory Smith, from fact-checkers First Draft News. ""He is this kind of voodoo doll that all these communities are pricking with their own conspiracies. And it is unsurprising he has become the voodoo doll - because he has always been the face of public health."" Theories falsely linking Bill Gates to the coronavirus were mentioned 1.2 million times on television or social media between February and April, according to a study by The New York Times and Zignal Labs. Much of the content is posted to public Facebook groups, from where it is shared millions of times. First Draft News has also found that Chinese viral video site TikTok is becoming a new home for such conspiracies. The BBC's anti-disinformation team has been researching some of the more outlandish ones. Rich and famous So how did the founder of Microsoft, who has poured billions into global healthcare from the philanthropic foundation he runs with his wife Melinda, become the bogeyman of Covid-19 conspiracy theorists? Prof Joseph Uscinski, a political scientist at the University of Miami and author of books on conspiracy theories, believes it is simply because he is rich and famous. ""Conspiracy theories are about accusing powerful people of doing terrible things,"" he told the BBC. ""The theories are basically the same, just the names change. ""Before Bill Gates, it was George Soros and the Koch brothers and the Rothchilds and the Rockefellers."" And while the majority of conspiracy theories ""die on the vine"", the ones that endure are those that offer ""big villains and address issues that people care about"". ""It should come as no surprise that rich people and big corporations are being accused of conspiring to put chips in our necks because that is a thing we fear,"" he said. ""This has been the ammo of conspiracy theories for a long, long time."" While he thinks such conspiracies have ""no tether to the truth whatsoever"", people still seem to be falling for them. More than a quarter of all Americans and 44% of Republicans believe that Bill Gates wants to use a Covid-19 vaccine to implant microchips under people's skin, according to a survey from Yahoo News and YouGov. Mr Smith thinks that there is often a ""kernel of truth"" which is taken ""way out of context"". So, for example, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation did fund a study, conducted by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology last year, which looked at the possibility of storing a patient's vaccination history in a pattern of dye. It would be invisible to the naked eye, and could be delivered under the skin at the same time as a vaccine. It is difficult to ascertain the root of conspiracy theories - but it's thought the internet is making them spread further. ""Before the internet, they were self-contained and existed only in their own echo chambers or bubbles within certain communities, but the internet allows them to travel across political lines, between communities, so I think there is much more scope to mainstream conspiracy theories than before the internet,"" said Mr Smith. And, he added, conspiracy theories had particularly flourished during this global pandemic because people were ""psychologically vulnerable"". ""This crisis is unprecedented in size and scope and the advice shifts as new studies are published. There are large areas of uncertainty and humans abhor uncertainty,"" he said. To deal with it, individuals resort to something he calls collective sense-making. ""We grab onto any information to inject some sort of sense and order and that is when the rumour mill starts. Conspiracy theories - and notably Bill Gates conspiracy theories - fill these informational vacuums."" 'Have to laugh' The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which has committed $300m (£240m) to combat Covid-19, has remained sanguine about the barrage of false claims. In a statement to the BBC it said: ""We're concerned about the conspiracy theories being spread online and the damage they could cause to public health. ""At a time like this, when the the world is facing an unprecedented health and economic crisis, it's distressing that there are people spreading misinformation when we we should all be looking for ways to collaborate and save lives. Right now, one the best things we can do to stop the spread of Covid-19 is spread the facts."" In an interview with the BBC, Bill Gates expressed surprise that he had become the figurehead of such theories. ""It is troubling that there is so much craziness. When we develop the vaccine we will want 80 percent of the population to take it and if they have heard it is a plot and we don't have people willing to take the vaccine that will let the disease continue to kill people."" I'm kind of surprised some of it is focused on me. We are just giving money away, we write the cheque.. and yes we do think about let's protect children against disease but it is nothing to do with chips and that type of stuff. You almost have to laugh sometimes.""","In 2015, an unassuming-looking Bill Gates came on stage at the TED conference in Vancouver to issue a dire warning."
"Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl now faces the possibility of life imprisonment. Who is Bowe Bergdahl? Sgt Bergdahl was released in March 2015, five years after being captured by Afghan Taliban, in a controversial exchange for five Taliban officials being held at Guantanamo Bay. The prisoner swap came after secret talks between the US government and the Taliban, brokered by Qatar. Bergdahl was serving with an Alaska-based infantry regiment in Paktika province near the Pakistani border and went missing on 30 June 2009, five months after being deployed to Afghanistan. The circumstances of his capture remain murky, with speculation he may have walked away from his base out of disillusionment with the US campaign. In March 2015, he was charged with desertion and misbehaviour before the enemy. The US believes he was across the frontier in Pakistan for most of his captivity, reportedly held by the Haqqani network, which operates in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region and is allied to the Afghan Taliban. Profile: Sgt Bowe Bergdahl What do we know about his disappearance? The circumstances of Sgt Bergdahl's capture in 2009 remain unclear, although a Pentagon investigation a year later concluded he left his post in Paktika Province without authorisation, according to a Pentagon official at the time. Several commentators and soldiers branded him a deserter and called for him to be punished. The Idaho native's lawyers have argued he cannot get a fair trial following criticism from Donald Trump during last year's presidential campaign. Mr Trump had called him ""a no-good traitor who should have been executed"". ""We may as well go back to kangaroo courts and lynch mobs,"" Sgt Bergdahl said in a 2016 interview that was obtained by ABC News and broadcast recently. The New York Times said on his disappearance in 2009 that he had left military areas before, during a training programme in California and an Afghan outpost, but returned each time. US officials told the newspaper the report did not conclude whether Sgt Bergdahl had intended to permanently desert the military. The US military's top-ranking officer, Gen Martin Dempsey, has that the Army would not ignore misconduct but that the soldier, now aged 31, was innocent until proven guilty. ""When he is able to provide the facts, we'll learn what happened."" The defence department opened up an investigation into his disappearance and capture, appointing a two-star general with combat experience in Afghanistan to lead the inquiry. How was he handed over? Taliban officials say the soldier was handed over near Khost, close to the the Afghan-Pakistan border, on the evening of 31 May. A several-dozen strong US special forces team flew in by helicopter and briefly met some 18 Taliban on the ground. The exchange, captured on video, shows Sgt Bergdahl sitting in a pick-up truck before being walked to the helicopter. Once the helicopter was in the air, Bergdahl wrote the letters ""SF?"" on a paper plate - an abbreviation for special forces - and reportedly broke down when the men responded: ""Yes, we've been looking for you for a long time."" Taliban release video of handover Why was he released? Sgt Bergdahl was the only US soldier being held by the enemy in the Afghan conflict, and Washington had long been seeking his release, spurred on by the ""Standing with Bowe"" campaign led by his parents in Hailey, Idaho. Negotiations for the US-Taliban prisoner swap began in 2012 with US and Taliban officials meeting face-to-face in Qatar. But the talks did not move forward because the US were pushing for a wider peace process, while the Taliban wanted to limit the talks to a prisoner swap, Taliban sources told the BBC. Direct negotiations broke down in 2014 when the Afghan government opposed the opening of a Taliban office in Qatar, although secret talks continued, mediated by Qatar. The issue was given more impetus as plans solidified to pull nearly all American forces out of Afghanistan by the end of 2016. US sources say the breakthrough came when hardline Taliban leaders dropped their opposition to a swap. Who are the Guantanamo detainees? The exchanged prisoners are Mohammad Fazl, Khirullah Khairkhwa, Abdul Haq Wasiq, Mullah Norullah Noori and Mohammad Nabi Omari. They were thought in 2015 to be the most senior Afghans still held at Guantanamo, having been captured during America's military campaign in 2001. Fazl served as the Taliban's deputy defence minister and is accused of possible war crimes, including the murder of thousands of Shia Muslims. Khairkhwa served as interior minister and governor of Herat, Afghanistan's third largest city. He is alleged to have had direct links to Osama bin Laden. Some argued at the time that there was a US precedent for this type of transfer, with Ronald Reagan's administration in 1985-86 reportedly winning the freedom of US hostages in Beirut in exchange for arms destined for Iran. Was there a political row over his release? Some US lawmakers complained at the time that the swap breached a law that Congress should be given 30 days' notification before Guantanamo Bay detainees are released. The White House said it took the chance to free Sgt Bergdahl in ""unique and exigent circumstances"". The US has a long-standing policy not to negotiate with those it deems terrorists and the prisoner swap has drawn criticism - especially from conservatives. Republican Senator John McCain told the BBC in 2015 that the swaps ""threatened"" US security, as the detainees released were too dangerous to be walking free, and would put other US military lives at risk. Other lawmakers called for an inquiry into the administration and military's decision making process. But President Obama remained publicly unapologetic for the swap. No Obama apology for Bergdahl deal Did the releases help the wider peace process?

"Westfield canal bridge near Stonehouse, Gloucestershire, was saved in 1969 by a woman who stood on it for a day to prevent workmen from blowing it up. A scheme to restore the Stroudwater Canal includes plans to reinstate the waterway beneath it. A £15m bid for Heritage Lottery cash for the project has begun. The Cotswold Canals Partnership is behind the bid, which would allow a section of the canal to be restored through to Saul Junction by 2020, at a total cost of £20m. Work will include burrowing beneath the Bristol to Birmingham railway line and ducking below the M5 with a new cutting being created alongside the River Frome. Westfield canal bridge still exists but now stands alone in the middle of a field. It was saved from demolition by local woman Christine Hearsey, who made local history by defying contractors who had been ordered to blow it up it to make way for a link road to the new motorway. As a result of her actions the road was built nearby instead. A six-week public consultation has begun and the final application for funding will be submitted in November. The scheme is part of the ongoing project to restore the seven mile-long (12 km) Stroudwater Navigation and the 29 mile-long (46km) Thames and Severn Canal. When completed, it will see the connection of the River Thames and the River Severn for the first time in more than 70 years.","A bridge, which was saved from demolition as part of a campaign when the M5 motorway was built, could soon have water flowing underneath it again."
"The event was cancelled in September 2010 after potentially toxic algae was discovered in the water by the Environment Agency. In an effort to avoid a repeat, the 2011 event has been scheduled for earlier in the year. Organisers are expecting about 10,000 swimmers to participate in the three-day event. This year a number of open water swimming distances have been introduced, including 0.5 mile (0.8 km), 1 mile (1.6km) and 2 mile (3.2 km). Wet suits are compulsory for the swimmers to help buoyancy and warmth. The water temperature is expected to be about 16C. A number of elite swimmers will also be taking part, including two of Britain's top swimmers, Dave Carry and Tom Allen. The elite women's race brings together Cassie Patten, from England, and Isabelle Haerle, from Germany. Patten was a bronze medallist in the 10k open water event at the Beijing Olympics. Many of the swimmers are raising money for charity. The first swimmers take to the water later on Friday.",Thousands of swimmers are expected to head to Windermere this weekend for the 2011 Great North Swim.
"The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said the WeetaKid app prompts such as ""What?! No Weetabix?!"" were persuasive and negative. The Northamptonshire-based firm said it took ""great care"" to ensure that its marketing complied with regulations. There had been a complaint that the app could make children feel ""unpopular"". Professor Agnes Nairn, from the Family and Parenting Institute, said the app ""exploited the credulity, loyalty, vulnerability or lack of experience of children by making them feel inferior or unpopular for not buying a product"". ASA ruled that the app, which included two games featuring the WeetaKid character, must be taken down from the Weetabix website and must not appear in its current form again. It added that it must ensure that any marketing aimed at children should not exploit them. Weetabix acknowledged the game's messages and actions might have an impact on children's food preferences, but said that in itself did not breach advertising regulations. In a statement, the company said: ""All of our cereals are recognised by the Food Standards Agency as not high in salt, fat or sugar and are therefore deemed to be acceptable for marketing to children. ""We do take great care to ensure that all our marketing complies with or exceeds our regulatory responsibilities."" The firm added it was willing to accept the ASA's ruling.","Weetabix must remove a children's game app over concerns it could make youngsters feel ""inferior"" for not eating the cereal."
"The protest on 9 February was over the 2013 hanging of Kashmiri man Mohammed Afzal Guru and allegedly saw the chanting of anti-India slogans. Police arrested JNU student union head Kanhaiya Kumar on sedition charges but also named five other organisers. The arrest led to protests and clashes in Delhi and universities across India. Government ministers have refused to back down and vowed to punish what they describe as ""anti-national elements"", but critics condemned the charges as an assault on freedom of expression. The five students - named as Umar Khalid, Anirban Bhattacharya, Ashutosh Kumar, Anant Prakash Narayan, Riyazul Haq and Rama Naga - went missing after they were named by police. They returned to campus late on Sunday night and addressed other students holding a vigil, reports said. A section of the media had accused Umar Khalid of having links with the Pakistan-based Islamist militant group Jaish-e-Mohammad, although the government later denied the reports. ""...I'm not a terrorist. I have never projected myself as a Muslim while doing politics on campus. I always tried to see exploitation of Muslims along with the exploitation faced by Dalits, tribals and others,"" Mr Khalid told a gathering. After news of the students return, police turned up at the JNU campus, Press Trust of India said, but reports say they need permission from university authorities to enter and arrest the students. At one of Mr Kumar's court appearances, he was set upon by a group of lawyers, an act which further inflamed public opinion. The protests triggered by the arrest and treatment of Mr Kumar spread far and wide with students from the southern city of Chennai (Madras) and in the eastern city of Kolkata (Calcutta) involved in violent clashes. Afzal Guru was executed over a 2001 plot to attack India's parliament - charges he always denied. The attack was carried out by Kashmiri militants and left 14 people dead. His 2013 hanging sparked protests in Kashmir, and he was seen as a martyr and a symbol of perceived injustice. But many of India's politicians were angered when reports surfaced of anti- India slogans chanted at the protest held to mark his execution. Correspondents say there has been a sharp rise in the number of sedition cases in recent years and many students see the latest moves as an attack on their right to dissent.","Five Indian students facing charges of sedition after organising a protest at Delhi's prestigious Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), have resurfaced."
"It is the second such claim to be rejected in court this week. The plaintiffs accused the airline of favouring slim and attractive cabin crew. Aeroflot said its rules were designed to ensure passenger safety. Aeroflot said it ""does not discriminate based on age, sex, weight, appearance, religious or political convictions"". In a statement to the BBC the airline called the allegations ""without foundation"". Its application form for would-be flight attendants requires details of height, weight and clothing size. In court, an Aeroflot official admitted that the airline regards heavily-built flight attendants as less suited to emergencies, when quick action is required. Aeroflot sets 48 as the maximum clothing size for its stewardesses (L; 16 in UK; 42 in Germany; 14 in US), Russia's Kommersant news website reports. Yevgenia Magurina, whose complaint was rejected on Friday, is size 52. Before the court ruling, she told the BBC's Outside Source radio programme that Aeroflot had transferred her to night flights inside Russia last summer. She was taken off international routes. ""In October my salary dropped significantly, apparently because I did not qualify for Aeroflot's size standards chart,"" she said. ""I just felt that it was impossible to keep silent any more. I have lost a lot of money, was exhausted after night flights, so I decided to take these extreme measures. They simply told me that Aeroflot has changed the rules of the game."" Besides passenger safety concerns, Aeroflot also argues that every extra kilogram of weight forces it to spend more on fuel.",A Moscow court has rejected a female flight attendant's sex discrimination claim against the Russian national carrier Aeroflot.
"Rhiannon Bennett, 17, was walking with friends when she was hit by cyclist Jason Howard on 2 April 2007. Howard was convicted of ""dangerous cycling"" and fined. Under the charge there was no penalty of imprisonment. Michael and Diana Bennett will hear their local MP Andrea Leadsom introduce a Commons Bill over the issue. During Howard's trial in August 2008, Aylesbury magistrates heard he had shouted at Rhiannon to ""move because I'm not stopping"", before crashing into her. 'National outcry' She died from head injuries six days later. Howard, from Buckingham, was fined £2,200, a penalty described as ""laughable"" by Rhiannon's parents. They have been campaigning since then for the introduction of more serious penalties for cyclists who cause death. The couple will be in the public gallery of the Commons to hear a Ten Minute Rule Bill by the South Northamptonshire MP. Mrs Leadsom's Bill is expected to propose that deaths caused by cyclists should be treated in a similar way to those caused by motorists or motorcyclists. The Conservative MP said: ""Imagine if a motorist had mounted the pavement and killed a schoolgirl as she chatted to her friends. ""The motorist would have felt the full force of the law and there would have been a national outcry if such a person had walked away with a fine.""",The parents of a Buckingham girl who was killed by a cyclist will be in the House of Commons later as their fight to change the law continues.
"The strike lasting for five hours ended at midnight and further action is scheduled for the New Year. But members of the FBU in Surrey and Kent were recalled after flooding was declared a ""major incident"". Scottish firefighters voted against a strike but have joined an overtime ban. Severe floods hit Surrey and Kent on Tuesday, with Dorking, Leatherhead and Tonbridge among areas affected. There is an agreement between the union, the government and the fire services that if there are major incidents, union members could be recalled, the FBU said. So if there are problems resulting from the storm that has hit the country, firefighters can be asked to go back and work - albeit voluntarily. Kitchen fires warning Ahead of the strike fire chiefs had urged the public to take extra care with Christmas celebrations. ""Millions of people will be at home celebrating Christmas and New Year when the Fire Brigades Union goes on strike,"" said the London Fire Commissioner Ron Dobson. ""Contingency plans are in place but we're urging people to take care, to be sensible, and to remember that fire brigades could be very busy during the strikes,"" he added. ""Make sure you keep candles well away from anything that could catch fire and switch off fairy lights when you go out or to bed. ""If you're preparing a festive feast, it's a good idea to keep an eye on cooking to prevent kitchen fires."" It was the FBU's seventh strike since September. The union says the government is ""refusing to honour long-standing agreements"" over pension arrangements. Changes to the pension scheme could also result in many firefighters in their late 50s being sacked, the union claims. Union officials met with fire minister Brandon Lewis earlier on Tuesday, but it is not yet clear if there was any agreement. Mr Lewis has described the action as ""completely cynical"" and added that there were ""robust contingency arrangements in place"". Meanwhile the London Fire Brigade said it had received five times the normal number of emergency 999 calls on Monday due to high winds and heavy rain hitting the capital.",Members of the Fire Brigades Union in England and Wales have held a further strike on Christmas Eve in a dispute over pensions.
"Last summer about 50,000 eggs were laid at Collard Hill but the cooler spring temperatures slowed down their metamorphosis. Ranger, Ian Clemmett, said despite the late start they hoped for another good year building on previous years. The caterpillars pupate in ants' nests before they crawl out as butterflies. Caterpillar con Mr Clemmett added: ""With so many eggs laid despite the poor weather last year there's a strong chance of a bumper year but it will all come down to the unpredictable element of how the underground caterpillar food - ant grubs - faired during the winter."" Eggs are laid onto wild thyme flowers and then drop to the ground once they hatch. As larvae drop to the ground, they trick ants into thinking they are lost ant grubs and are carried into ants' nests where they munch up ant grubs. After pupating they crawl out for a flight season which normally lasts for about a month. The Large Blue was re-introduced to the Somerset site in the summer of 2000 and the first successful flight season was the following year. The reintroduction is part of the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology's Large Blue Project. Collard Hill is one of 25 Large Blue sites in south west England.","The first Large Blue butterflies at a Somerset nature reserve have begun emerging a month later than normal, the National Trust has said."

"The cult BBC Three sitcom This Country picked up best scripted comedy and best female comedy performance for its star. The red football shirt dress made its debut on the red carpet at the Bafta Television Awards on Sunday evening. Dress creator Fiona Hesford said: ""You always think the worst - but when I saw her I thought she's so pulled it off."" Worn by the star of the BBC Three mockumentary, the red polyester crepe dress not only featured Swindon on the front, but ""Mucklowe"" - Cooper's character Kerry's surname - on the back. Ms Hesford from Worthing, Sussex said she was asked to create the dress by Cooper's aunt. ""When she came to me and said: ""Do you think you can make a dress for the Baftas? I was like: ""Oh no, no, no - that's way too big for me"","" she said. ""But when she told me the idea, I thought I've got to do this."" Sporting a Swindon Town FC badge taken from a bought club shirt and white sequins to add ""that extra bit of glamour"", Ms Hesford said it took several days to create. ""My friend took the fitting, so it was nerve racking because I never really saw [Daisy May Cooper] in the dress,"" she said. ""I thought she might bottle out at the last minute but watching the event live on the red carpet, we suddenly glimpsed her wearing the dress and we all screamed."" Cooper, who celebrated as if Swindon Town had just been promoted to the Premier League, said the dress had been ""fabulous"". ""I just decided it had to be done, because Kerry wears Swindon, we're doing it for the south-west,"" she said.

"In 2013 and 2014 the bank allowed fraudsters to transfer millions of dollars around the world even after it had learned of their scam, leaked secret files show. HSBC says it has always met its legal duties on reporting such activity. On Monday in Hong Kong, the shares fell more than 5.3% to close at HK$29.30. In London they fell by a similar amount. Leaked documents from the US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), involving about $2tn of transactions have revealed how some of the world's biggest banks have allowed criminals to move dirty money around the world. Shares in rival banks named in the papers have also been hit. At lunchtime, Standard Chartered and Barclays were down by 5% and 6% respectively, while Germany's Deutsche Bank was down 8%. The share price falls came against a backdrop of broader negative sentiment on share markets. UK shares were down sharply amid fears of further Covid-related restrictions. HSBC had been under pressure on multiple fronts before the files were leaked and its shares have taken a particularly hard battering this year, falling by some 50%. It has been at the sharp end of political pressures in Hong Kong, and from the pandemic fallout. Although HSBC is headquartered in London, more than half of its profits come from Asia and its shares are important components of both the London and Hong Kong share markets. Its role in a $80m (£62m) fraud is detailed inthe FinCEN leak of documents - banks' ""suspicious activity reports"". HSBC moved the money through its US business to HSBC accounts in Hong Kong in 2013 and 2014. The bank says it has always reported such activity in accordance with its legal obligations. Multiple pressures HSBC, which is Europe's biggest bank, has set aside between $8bn and $13bn this year for bad loans as it expects more people and businesses to default on their repayments because of the coronavirus pandemic. In August, it reported a 65% drop in pre-tax profits to $4.3bn for the first half of the year - much steeper than analysts had forecast. It also became embroiled in a political battle over its support of China's national security law in Hong Kong and was lambasted by both the US and UK. Cost-cutting HSBC is currently pushing ahead with major restructuring of its global banking operations. Chief executive Noel Quinn, who officially took over in March, said the bank would further pivot into Asia as its European operations lose money. Mr Quinn said HSBC would ""accelerate"" an earlier restructuring plan which includes the axing of 35,000 jobs.",HSBC's share price has fallen to its lowest level since 1995 amid allegations of money laundering.
"By Gavin HainesLondon ""I found myself at a police station on my own. The counter seemed so high because I was only a little girl and I remember the policeman asking: 'Why are you not crying?' I think about his words now and ask myself: 'Yeah, why wasn't I crying?' I suppose I was in shock."" Daniela Walther recalls the night she was caught trying to flee East Berlin. It was 13 August 1961. She was five years old. Two days earlier her father, Karl-Heinz Prietz who was a reporter at a teaching magazine, had come home with a tip-off that the authorities in the German Democratic Republic (GDR) were going to close the border between communist East Berlin and capitalist West Berlin. ""He knew they were going to build a wall,"" says Walther, referring to the Berlin Wall, which fell 25 years ago, on 9 November 1989. Knowing it would be all but impossible to move to West Berlin after the barrier was erected, Walther's father convinced her mother to flee right away. ""She was reluctant to give up her teaching job - teaching was her raison d'etre - but she agreed,"" says Walther. ""My father told us where to go, where we would try to cross, and we waited for him in this allotment. We stayed there on the night of 11 August, sleeping in somebody's shed. I remember my mother agonising and telling me to be quiet. I felt afraid."" The following evening her father came and led them to what he thought was a weak spot in the border, which was already quite heavily patrolled. ""He went ahead and called for my mother to follow, but she froze - she didn't have the courage. I remember standing next to her, listening to my dad calling."" And then the guards appeared. ""They came out of the darkness and arrested my father. They took him away - I didn't see him for another eight years,"" she says. Walther and her mother were also arrested and taken to a police station. Her mother was sentenced to nine months in prison for being an accomplice to the escape attempt and Walther was sent to live with her grandparents in the village of Stockhausen. ""Being the daughter of someone who tried to cross the border was worse than being the daughter of a murderer,"" she says. ""My grandparents said: 'If anyone asks, tell them you're the daughter of Lilo,' who was my aunt in West Germany."" Walther adjusted quickly to her new life. ""I was actually very happy. My grandparents had lots of animals, including a dog, and because of collectivisation everything was open - there was no private land or fences - so I used to go off exploring."" Walther even taught herself to ski. ""I found my father's skis, which were far too big for me, and I learned to ski in the orchard - which was probably quite dangerous,"" she says. When her mother was released from prison the pair moved to Potsdam, where their relationship became fraught. ""My mother was really quite unstable,"" recalls Walther. She distracted herself by enrolling in the army's horse acrobatics team, and performing in the breaks at equestrian events. Meanwhile, East Germany's economy was in free fall. Many skilled workers and intellectuals had fled and the Soviet Union was stripping the country of its resources. By 1964 the fiscal situation had become so dire that the authorities developed a scheme to sell political prisoners to West Germany. They called it haeftlingsfreikauf. The Berlin Wall ""Between 1964 and 1989 some 33,755 political prisoners and 250,000 of their relatives were sold to West Germany, for a sum totalling 3.5bn Deutschmarks,"" says historian and author, Andreas Apelt. ""Both sides had an interest in the business - the GDR because it needed Western currency and the West because it wanted to save people from the inhumane prisons of the GDR."" Prisoners were also traded for commodities such as coffee, copper and oil. However, neither side wanted the public to find out - the GDR because it didn't want to appear weak and West Germany because it didn't want to be seen supporting the communist regime. So the operation remained clandestine - people were traded in darkened nooks of the underground railway, the U-Bahn, or sent across the border in buses with revolving license plates. The number plates would switch at the checkpoints, so as not to arouse suspicion on the other side. In 1968, a price for Walther's father, Karl-Heinz Prietz, was negotiated. ""He'd been in prison for eight years. He was tortured - he didn't explain the methods, but they destroyed his health. I don't think he saw daylight for years,"" she says. While locked away, Prietz had spent hours writing down the bedtime stories he had once recounted to his daughter. ""He invented stories about two bears called Bumsi and Plumsi, who had lots of adventures,"" she says. ""In prison he continued to write these stories in old exercise books - there was a huge pile of them."" However, prisoners weren't allowed to leave East Germany with anything except their clothes, so he sent the books to his wife for safe keeping. Once Prietz was settled in West Berlin, a deal was made for Walther and her mother to follow. ""I really didn't want to go - I wanted to stay in East Germany with my grandparents - but the deal was for wife and daughter,"" she says. ""I think they paid 100,000 Deutschmarks for us."" When the time came to pack their bags, her mother said there was no space for her father's story books. ""She didn't bring them with us. She said there wasn't enough room, even though we took all this other junk. I have never forgiven her,"" says Walther. The two of them were taken across the border via Bahnhof Friedrichstrasse, a railway station on the frontier between East and West Berlin. It was 1969 and Daniela was 13 years old. ""My friend Gudrun came with us to say goodbye. I was very sad to leave her. She said she would come and visit when she was 60, because you were allowed to leave East Germany when you were 60."" After bidding farewell to Gudrun, Walther and her mother were interrogated by the secret services of the UK, France and the US, which controlled West Berlin. ""They asked all these questions and I remember thinking: 'Sorry my life is so boring,'"" says Walther. ""My father was waiting for us on the other side. I didn't recognise him, which was very painful for him. He was crying."" Having been so young when they were separated, Walther felt more upset about losing her friend. Life in West Berlin didn't work out for the reunited family. Walther's parents split up and she had difficulty adapting to the unfamiliar school system. ""When you're a child, school is the centre of your world and I hated it,"" she says. ""I went from being top of the class in East Germany to being at the bottom. My language teacher told me I would never get to grips with English."" Determined to prove her teacher wrong, Walther persuaded her father to pay for her to attend a language school in the UK. ""I was the apple of his eye - he would have done anything for me,"" she says. So in 1972 Walther arrived in the UK and before long went on to study languages at Goldsmiths College in London. In her second year she met her husband, Bill, with whom she had two children. Framed pictures of Berlin adorn the walls of their south London home. Walther, now 59 and a teacher like her mother, is glad she left East Germany. ""It was for the best - otherwise I wouldn't have come to the UK, met Bill or moved to London, which is a city I love,"" she says. ""But if I had stayed, then I would have made a good life over there. People were well looked after and I agreed with the principles of the state - I still do - just not all the spying and oppression."" Although she disapproves of the idea of selling prisoners, she understands why it happened. ""It was pretty mercenary of the East Germans, but they were being bled dry by the Russians,"" she says. ""For West Germany it was a humanitarian effort."" Walther's father died in 1996, followed by her mother in 2010. After that night at the border their relationship never recovered. ""She just couldn't decide,"" says Walther. ""And that's what ruined them.""

"The list was compiled using tips from 170 tastemakers, who each named their favourite three emerging artists. Californian trio Haim came out on top last year, with Adele, Ellie Goulding and Jessie J also among past winners. This year's crop includes singers Sam Smith and Ella Eyre, who have both already featured on number one singles. Smith, 21, from Cambridgeshire, lent his bittersweet soul voice to Naughty Boy's La La La, which topped the charts in June, as well as Disclosure's track Latch. Brit School graduate Eyre, meanwhile, was a guest vocalist on Rudimental's hit Waiting All Night in April and has sung with Tinie Tempah and Bastille. While those two already have a foothold on fame, the Sound of 2014 list also includes artists like Jungle, a mysterious West London electro-funk duo who have created an online buzz but have not yet revealed their identities. The longlist will be narrowed down to a top five in the week of 6 January, with the winner to be named on 10 January. The list is made up of seven solo male artists, five solo females and three duos. Bands are out of fashion. One of the duos, Brighton's riff-heavy Royal Blood are the sole representatives of rock music. They have been likened to the White Stripes and Queens of the Stone Age and will support the Arctic Monkeys next summer. Chicago's Chance The Rapper, who was named 2013's Hot MC by Rolling Stone magazine, is flying the flag for hip-hop. The 20-year-old - real name Chancelor Bennett - appeared as a guest vocalist on James Blake's Mercury Prize-winning album Overgrown. BBC Radio 1 head of music George Ergatoudis said: ""The most competitive area next year is going to be male singer-songwriters."" There are three such singer-strummers in contention for Sound of 2014. Nick Mulvey is a former member of Mercury-nominated jazz combo Portico Quartet and an aficionado of Cuban and African music. Now solo, the 26-year-old is signed to Communion Records, owned by Mumford and Sons' Ben Lovett. The sound of Luke Sital-Singh, from Surrey, ranges from rousing Mumfords-style choruses to the simple songcraft of Damien Rice. The gruff voice of Bristol's 19-year-old George Ezra, meanwhile, makes his folk-blues ballads particularly distinctive. Of the other solo males, Uzoechi Osisioma Emenike (known as MNEK), from London, is moving in front of the microphone after making his name writing songs including Duke Dumont and A*M*E*'s club anthem Need U (100%). And with a mellow soul voice that has already been heard on records by SBTRKT and Drake, Londoner Sampha is launching his solo career. George Ergatoudis said one of the dominant styles for 2014 would be ""indie R&B"" - R&B made with an independent, experimental mindset. Female vocalists Kelela - aka the sonically adventurous 30-year-old Los Angeles-based Kelela Mizanekristos - and the eerie-voiced Londoner FKA Twigs, who is signed to the label that launched the xx, fall into that bracket. And Banks, the stage name of 25-year-old Jillian Banks, from Los Angeles, has gained a devoted fanbase with her moody, intimate R&B. Elsewhere on the list, the sassy pop of Chloe Howl has seen her compared to Lily Allen and Katy B, while Say Lou Lou are Swedish-Australian twin sisters Miranda and Elektra Kilbey, who create dreamy electro-pop. The tastemakers whose tips were used to compile the list included radio DJs and producers, TV presenters and producers, newspaper critics, magazine and website editors and respected bloggers. They included Hattie Collins, music editor at i-D Magazine, who said: ""One of the strengths of the Sound Of list is the democratic, diverse range of people that are invited to vote, with people from all musical mediums from the established rock critic to the upcoming urban blogger. ""This diversity is reflected in the 2014 longlist, which has a broad spectrum of emerging artists from a variety of scenes."" The successful acts cannot already be well-known to the UK public, for example through featuring in the final stages of a TV talent show or having already been a member of a successful band. They must also not have been the lead artist on a UK top 20 single or album before 4 November 2013 - but guest vocalists are eligible. Since coming top of the Sound of 2013 list, Haim have gone to number one on the UK albums chart with their debut release Days Are Gone.","Fifteen rising music artists have been named on the longlist for the BBC Sound of 2014 , which showcases some of the brightest new acts for the year ahead."
"His comments come as peace negotiations resume in Cuba aimed at ending more than five decades of conflict. Mr de la Calle reaffirmed that the army would continue fighting until the end. More than 220,000 people are estimated to have been killed in the conflict, most of them civilians. ""I must remind you that the government has decided not to agree a ceasefire until, of course, the conflict comes to an end,"" said Mr de la Calle. ""If we sign a final peace accord, then the Farc will be able to get into politics. But in a democracy and without weapons, only after they demobilise."" The current round of negotiations is intended to focus on the Farc's transition into formal politics. But a Farc negotiator in Havana confused journalists by reading a statement making reference to land reform, an issue on which there was agreement in May. ""There would be no point in discussing land reform in Havana if the government continues to reduce what has been agreed to empty words which vanish in the wind,"" said Andres Paris. 'Worse than war' The talks were launched last November in the Cuban capital, 10 years after the failure of previous face-to-face negotiations. At the time, the Colombian government was accused of being naive by agreeing to a ceasefire and allowing the rebels to operate in a vast demilitarised area. But the government of President Juan Manuel Santos has decided to continue fighting the rebels until they give up their armed struggle and join the legal political process. There is huge pressure in Colombia, however, for justice for those who have perpetrated acts of violence from both sides of the conflict. ""The guerrilla will be held to account for everything that has happened during the conflict,"" said Mr de la Calle. The rebels say most of the victims were poor peasants and other civilians targeted by the army and right-wing paramilitaries for their alleged support to the rebels. Earlier this month, the main Farc negotiator, Ivan Marquez, said Colombia had to prepare for peace as the conflict was ""nearing an end"". The government said a final settlement must be agreed by November. The Farc warned of the dangers of rushing into a settlement. ""It is possible [to reach an agreement by November]. But to achieve peace you need time. A bad peace deal is worse than war,"" he said in an interview with Colombian network RCN. His comments came days before at least 15 soldiers were killed in an ambush near the Venezuelan border in an ambush the government blamed on the Farc.",Chief Colombian government peace negotiator Humberto de la Calle has said the leftist Farc rebel group will be held to account for all the acts of violence it has committed.

Strong winds and heavy rains have already begun lashing North Carolina's coastline, leading to some early flooding. Some 11,000 power outages had already been reported in the state. Reuters news agency reports. Florence was 155 miles (250km) east of Myrtle Beach in South Carolina at 17:00 EDT (21:00 GMT), and is projected to make landfall on Friday at 08:00 local time. It was downgraded to a category two storm with 105mph (165km/h) winds, and the US National Hurricane Center (NHC) said it does not expect much change in the strength before the eye of Florence makes landfall. Why isn't the downgraded storm less of a threat? Fema administrator Brock Long told Thursday morning's news conference that while Florence's wind speed had dipped, its wind field had expanded and total rainfall predictions were unchanged. Floodwaters may rise up to 13ft (4m) as rivers see their flows ""reversed"", meteorologists have warned. ""So this is a very dangerous storm,"" said Mr Long. ""Inland flooding kills a lot of people unfortunately and that's what we're about to see."" ""Your time is running out,"" he warned those who had not yet heeded the warning to evacuate. ""The ocean is going to start rising."" Ask a question Share this chatbot. ""Your time to get out of those areas in storm surge inundation is coming to a close. I cannot emphasise that enough."" He said that people living near rivers, streams and lowland areas in the region were most at risk. What's the situation on the ground? The latest weather predictions show the storm slowing to a near standstill as it pummels the coast with ""copious amounts of rain"" from Thursday night to Saturday, said Mr Long. Parts of the Carolina coast are expecting 20-30 (50-75cm) inches of rain, with isolated regions seeing up to 40in of downpour. Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, is imposing a 12-hour curfew from 19:00 local time on Thursday. Petrol stations in the area are reporting shortages and energy companies predict that one to three million homes and businesses may lose power. Over 1,400 flights have been cancelled, according to FlightAware.com, as most of the coastal region's airports are closed to ride out the storm. Hurricanes A guide to the world's deadliest storms Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters. Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face."" Florida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017) The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms.This eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it. A mound of water piles up below the eye which is unleashed as the storm reaches land. These storm surges can cause more damage from flooding than the winds. ""Urgent warning about the rapid rise of water on the SW FL coast with the passage of #Irma's eye.

Swipe to progress North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper warned people: ""Today the threat becomes a reality."" Emergency workers are arriving from other parts of the US to aid in rescues. The Coast Guard has shallow-water response boats ready to help trapped residents. Is global warming to blame? The relationship between climate change and hurricanes is a complex one. Warmer seas power hurricanes. So as the temperature of ocean water goes up, we might expect the intensity of hurricanes to increase in future. A hotter atmosphere can also hold more water, so this should allow hurricanes to dump more water on affected areas. But there are so many factors that contribute to these rare events, it has been difficult to tease out clear trends from the data. Are you in the area? How are you preparing for the hurricane?

"By Judith BurnsEducation reporter From next year, the new GCSE will require pupils in England to study two religions but not humanism. The parents fear excluding humanism may lead children to believe religion ""has a monopoly on truth and on morality"". In February, former Archbishop of Canterbury the Right Reverend Lord Williams urged a government rethink. He was among 28 religious leaders to sign a letter urging the government to allow students ""the option of systematic study of humanism in GCSE"". 'Lack of parity' The three claimants asking for judicial review of the government's decision are all parents of children due to take GCSEs in the next few years. ""I completely recognise the importance of children learning about the different religions, especially in our increasingly diverse society,"" said Kate Bielby, from Somerset, whose daughter Daisy is 12. ""What I object to is the lack of parity between religious beliefs and non-religious worldviews in the school curriculum, which in the eyes of children may well lead to the belief that religion, in whatever form, has a monopoly on truth and on morality. ""This is not accurate, it reflects neither the views of the population nor the traditions of the country, and we shouldn't be encouraging our children to believe it."" The one-day High Court challenge is backed by the British Humanist Association (BHA). Chief executive Andrew Copson said the new subject content amounted to a breach of the government's obligations to ensure a broad and balanced religious studies syllabus. ""The law is clear that when teaching about religions and beliefs, schools should follow a broad and balanced syllabus which includes both religious and non-religious worldviews like humanism on an equal footing,"" he said. ""The religious studies GCSE is therefore incompatible with the rights of non-religious parents and the entitlement of young people to an education that does not indoctrinate them, even by omission. ""It amounts to a breach of the government's obligations and that is what we are seeking the court to affirm, in line with overwhelming public and professional opinion."" Faiths included The proposed course will require pupils to study two faiths and aims to develop a stronger understanding of the central role of religion in British culture. The faiths included are: The Department for Education launched the plans a year ago, saying it had worked closely with experts from all the major faith groups to develop the ""more academically rigorous qualification"", which it maintains will allow students to choose options that can include humanism and other religious beliefs. A ruling on the challenge is expected within the next few months.",Three families are due in court on Tuesday to challenge the decision to exclude non-religious beliefs from the new religious studies GCSE syllabus.
"The British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS), which provides abortion care, wants Boots and other pharmacies to reduce the cost of emergency contraception Levonelle. Boots told the BPAS it wanted to avoid ""incentivising inappropriate use"". The company said it was ""disappointed by the focus"" BPAS had taken. Currently, the progestogen-based drug Levonelle costs £28.25 in Boots, and its non-branded equivalent is £26.75. But the branded drug costs £13.50 at Tesco and a generic version is £13.49 in Superdrug. However, Superdrug charges £27 for Levonelle and £35 for an alternative emergency contraceptive pill, EllaOne. 'Affordable price' BPAS lobbied Boots to reduce the cost of the pill to make it more accessible for women having difficulty getting the drug quickly on the NHS. Clare Murphy, BPAS director of external affairs, said: ""Most people believe women should be able to access emergency contraception from pharmacies at an affordable price."" But the chief pharmacist at Boots UK, Marc Donovan, said: ""In our experience, the subject of [emergency hormonal contraception] polarises public opinion and we receive frequent contact from individuals who voice their disapproval of the fact that [Boots] chooses to provide this service. ""We would not want to be accused of incentivising inappropriate use, and provoking complaints, by significantly reducing the price of this product."" He added that the chemist wanted to avoid the pill ""being misused or overused"". MP Yvette Cooper told Boots on Twitter: ""This is patronising and pathetic - keeping emergency contraception price too high cos you don't trust women and are scared of critics."" When asked to explain their stance, Boots released a statement saying the price of emergency contraception included ""a professional healthcare consultation"". It said: ""This consultation helps support customers in their choice by examining an individual's full medical history and any potential drug interactions."" 'Better access' Sandra Gidley, chair of Royal Pharmaceutical Society England, said it wanted to see all community pharmacies in England supplying emergency contraception free through the NHS. ""NHS emergency contraception services have been available free through pharmacies in Scotland and Wales for some time and we would like to see that replicated across the whole of the country so women get better access, regardless of their ability to pay."" The morning after pill can be taken in the days after unprotected sex to prevent pregnancy. In England, Levonelle and EllaOne are free of charge from most sexual health clinics, most GP surgeries and most NHS walk-in centres or urgent care centres - but they are free only to women in certain age groups from pharmacies in some parts of the country. In Scotland and Wales, the emergency contraceptive pill is available free of charge on the NHS from pharmacies, GPs and sexual health clinics. In Northern Ireland, some pharmacies allow it to be bought on the NHS, and it is available free of charge from sexual health clinics and GPs.",Boots has been accused of refusing to cut the cost of one of its morning-after pills for fear of criticism from campaigners.
"By Jenny HillBBC News, Dresden Announcing the measures at the weekend, Chancellor Angela Merkel said that an existing ""lockdown light"", which closed bars, restaurants, arts and leisure facilities at the beginning of November, had not done enough to tackle Germany's second wave. The country has experienced record numbers of infections and deaths in the past fortnight and intensive care units are filling up. What are Germany's lockdown measures? There'll be no let up over New Year either. No gatherings on the streets will be allowed, and the sale of fireworks is prohibited - many Germans like to celebrate Silvester, as it's called here, with a bang. For a country that cherishes its Christmas traditions there are precious few joyful tidings. In normal times, Dresden's old market square would be crammed with people enjoying its world-famous Christmas market. The city's Christmas lights still twinkle but the streets are quiet and, even before shops here were ordered to close, business was hardly booming. ""It hurts,"" said Astrid Rademacher as she rearranged silver decorations and antique glassware in her shop. The government has promised more financial aid to affected businesses, and has taken on new debt in order to fund rescue packages. But asked whether her business could survive, she's unsure. ""I hope, I hope. We will see. If we get some help, we will see."" A few doors down, Mario Somplatzki, whose shop sells the elegant carved wooden figures and decorations for which this region is famous, said that, despite the economic pain, it was the right decision - one which, he said, should have been made sooner. ""I think it's a good decision because there are no other plans right now."" Recent surveys suggest that the majority of Germans support, if reluctantly, the measures described by President Frank Walter Steinmeier on Monday as the most severe restrictions on public and private life in post-war German history. But what's gone wrong for the country that came so successfully through the first wave of the pandemic? Some blame Germany's regional leaders who, until now, have dithered, bickered and resisted Angela Merkel's calls for a tougher nationwide response. And Prof Iris Pigeot, director of the Leibniz Institute for Prevention Research and Epidemiology, says that ""people do not follow all the regulations that they're told. We had to reduce our contacts by about 75% but I think that didn't work"". She's concerned. ""New Year's Eve and Christmas could be a complete nightmare with increasing numbers, increasing numbers of deaths."" Impatience for German vaccine Inevitably, as Britain and the US start vaccination programmes using a German-developed vaccine, there is growing impatience here that Germany is still, along with other EU countries, waiting for European regulators to approve it. It's anticipated vaccination rollout can begin before the end of the year, with the health minister suggesting that 60% of the population could be vaccinated by the summer. And already, among the snow-covered forests of south-west Germany, one family firm is working around the clock. For decades, Binder GmbH has manufactured storage units for medical and scientific research facilities. Now its freezers, which can transport and store the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine at the required -70C, are in demand, and not only from domestic customers. ""We are producing a high four-digit number of freezers a year,"" says CEO Peter Binder. ""We are a handful of leading manufacturers in the world making that product but we have to serve the globe."" Hope, perhaps. But for Germany this Christmas, little cheer.","Few Germans had expected to enjoy all the trappings of a traditional Christmas this year but new countrywide restrictions, which come into force on Wednesday, will limit festivities to the smallest of family gatherings. No carolling, no parties and even Germany's much loved glühwein stalls will close, as drinking outdoors is banned."
"By Roland HughesBBC News The ferry sank in April 2014 causing the deaths of 304 people, and now sits on its side on the sea bed. Experts say the salvage operation could be complicated by a number of factors. But the government is hopeful it can be lifted in one piece - and has put forward plans for how to do so. The ferry sank in waters between 37 and 43 metres (121 and 141 feet) deep. While salvage operations have been undertaken in deeper seas, the site of the Sewol is subject to dangerous currents and, on the surface, heavy winds. Two options At a press conference on 10 April, South Korea's Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries outlined how the ship could be lifted. The ministry said a recovery of the ship in one piece was ""risky, but technically possible"". First option Second option One option would see 93 holes drilled in the side of the ferry to allow chains to be attached. The ferry would then be lifted by cranes placed on boats, before being moved onto a floating dock on the surface of the sea. A second option would see the Sewol lifted to a shallower part of the sea bed where there is better visibility. It would then be gradually lifted until it reached an area with weaker currents. Lee Kyu-yeul, the head of the ministry's salvage task force, said he preferred the second option. ""For plan one, there is a risk that the ferry could be destroyed into pieces if the crane wires fail to sustain it due to unexpected strong currents,"" he said. Tunnel in the sand John Noble, a director with Constellation Marine Services, a salvage company, said there was a third possible option. ""They could try and get slings around the hull and lift it up that way,"" he said. ""It depends on the sea bed. If it's sand, you can bury a tunnel underneath the hull to hook the sling there. But if it's rock, they would have to blast some of it away."" Mr Noble said the recovery would be ""very, very different"" to that of the Costa Concordia cruise ship, which was raised using inflatable tanks after capsizing in Italy in January 2012. He said: ""It won't be anything like the type of salvage operation you had with the Costa Concordia - in design and from a finance point of view."" The final cost of the operation is likely to be made public only once the salvage company is announced. But some reports in South Korea say it could cost as much as $137m (£92m). 'Much more tricky' Mark Hoddinott, the general manager of the International Salvage Union, said: ""It sounds like they will try and lift it in one piece, mainly because they suspect there are still bodies on board and they don't want to break it up. ""This will make it much more tricky. The easiest thing would be to cut it into sections and lift the smaller pieces, which isn't that challenging, technically. ""So this is going to require very careful rigging to lift it. And they are going to have to spend a lot of time ensuring that the ship isn't going to break in two."" Mr Hoddinott also warned of another potential major obstacle. ""One of the biggest issues is that these ships do tend to fill up with mud if they've been underwater for any amount of time. ""So if it is full of mud, that will present a real issue as it will make it much heavier to lift.""",South Korea's president has promised the wreckage of the Sewol ferry will be raised at the earliest opportunity. But is it that straightforward?

"Complex operations will no longer take place at the West Cumberland Hospital in Whitehaven, the North Cumbria University Hospital Trust said. The distance between the two hospitals is almost 40 miles. A spokesman for the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) said the move ""made sense in clinical terms"". 'Understandably concerned' Out-of-hours procedures will transfer from Friday with all other high-risk surgery moving to the Cumberland Infirmary in Carlisle from 1 October. Two or three people each week will travel to Carlisle from West Cumbria for operations such as those linked to appendicitis or broken hips, the trust said. The RCN spokesman said: ""While some members of the local community may be understandably concerned at the added journey time, it is better to have a safe, high-quality service concentrated at a single site, rather than having expertise spread too thinly."" In July, the trust was put into special measures over death rates as part of the Keogh Review set up in the wake set up of shortcomings that led to a higher than expected number of deaths at the Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust. Dr Jeremy Rushmer, North Cumbria's interim medical director, said centralising high-risk surgery at one site was something that had been considered for ""a long time"". ""Concentrating complex and high-risk surgery in Carlisle has been widely agreed for some time now and following Keogh it is an absolute clinical priority for us to deliver on these promises. ""All of these sorts of operations were competing for theatre and operative time and it was very hard, spread across two sites, to deliver all of that.""",Patients from West Cumbria requiring high-risk surgery will have to travel to Carlisle as a result of changes announced by the local NHS trust.
"It has been ""a real struggle"" to make the usual range of festive shows during Covid, the BBC's Charlotte Moore said. But, she added, the stars and crews ""pulled out all the stops"". ""Some of the big talent and the production teams have rallied together, and we feel it's really important to have a good Christmas."" The BBC's Christmas TV line-up includes special episodes The Goes Wrong Show, Ghosts, Not Going Out, King Gary, Motherland and the return of The Vicar of Dibley. Miranda Hart will host a one-off celebrity game show, and there will be Christmas editions of shows ranging from The Repair Shop and The Great British Sewing Bee to The Hit List, The Wall and Mortimer & Whitehouse: Gone Fishing. The vast majority have been filmed under Covid restrictions. ""Trying to work out what we could actually manage to pull off for Christmas... I can't pretend it's been relaxing or without its challenges,"" said Moore, who is the BBC's chief content officer. Doctor Who: Revolution of the Daleks, in which John Barrowman returns as Captain Jack Harkness to help the Doctor battle her age-old enemies, was one of the few to have been filmed before coronavirus struck. Executive producer Chris Chibnall promised ""an epic and emotional feature-length episode"". Call the Midwife, another perennial favourite, was among the shows that had to be shot after the first UK lockdown. ""We were so relieved when they sent me a picture of them finishing production,"" Moore said. ""With some shows it's been easier than others to get talent and everyone together, and with some shows it's taken a lot of effort. But I sensed a real camaraderie to make this happen."" The pandemic interrupted filming for two major drama series, requiring ""herculean efforts"" in the editing room, Moore said. One was Black Narcissus, which stars Gemma Arterton as a nun in the Himalayas in the 1930s and Dame Diana Rigg in her final role. The other, The Serpent, stars Jenna Coleman in the real-life story of the unsolved murders of young Western travellers in India, Thailand and Nepal in the 1970s. It completed its filming after the first lockdown. But some shows proved impossible in the current conditions. The Strictly Come Dancing Christmas special will be a compilation of the 25 most memorable dances of all time, rather than the usual dancefloor contest, for example. Last year's biggest ratings hit was the return of Gavin and Stacey. Moore said a follow-up had never been planned for this Christmas. ""That wasn't something that was going to happen this year,"" she said. ""One day."" Other highlights this year will include: Moore added: ""It's been a real struggle but I think people have really wanted to make sure these shows could get on air.""

"By Alice EvansBBC News 1. Value for money For the men's World Cup last summer, your pockets had to be bulging with Russian roubles if you wanted a chance to see football come home (or not) with your own eyes. The best seats in the house for the France v Croatia men's final cost an eye-watering 66,000 roubles (£824.44). But don't despair. If you don't have a spare 800 quid jangling around, it's still possible for you to go to a World Cup final. The most expensive seats in the women's final at the Stade de Lyon on 7 July are more than 10 times cheaper than in the men's tournament at £75.12 (84EUR). At the Women's World Cup in France this year, you can actually watch a game for as little as £8.05 (9EUR). C'est magnifique, non? This pricing imbalance manifests itself in merchandise, too. Perhaps to Nike's credit, the official shirts of the men's and women's World Cups both cost £89.95. However, while it is free to add the name of a Lioness to the women's shirt, it costs £13 to splash names such as Kane, Rashford or Vardy across your shoulders. Nike hasn't responded to a request for clarification on why this is the case. 2. More goals The stats speak for themselves on this one. For a start, Brazilian women's forward Marta is the all-time World Cup top scorer for both men and women, with 17 goals to her name across 19 matches. So far in this year's tournament the women have scored 2.69 goals per game - just edging out the men, who scored 2.64 goals per game in last year's World Cup. The women are even further ahead in the top leagues. Over the last three seasons of the Women's Super League there were 3.05 goals per match, compared with a measly 2.76 goals in the men's top tournament, the Premier League. 3. Women stick to the rules We're not saying women are angels on the pitch (in fact, Cameroon were described as quite the opposite when they played England on Sunday). But they break the rules less often than men do. Fifa didn't provide stats for bookings in World Cup games, but we did manage to pull some together from data provided by Opta Sports for the FA, which runs England's top league games. It turns out, in the 2018-19 season, Premier League players (men) were three times more likely than players in the Women's Super League to be sent off in matches. Men were also handed yellow cards twice as often. Over the last three seasons, there were 3,777 yellow cards given to Premier League players - a rate of 3.3 per game - compared with 399 given to Women's Super League players (1.5 per game). Janie Frampton, who has refereed both men's and women's international matches in her 30-year career, said the ""streak of cheating"" that so many top male players express is in part down to ""far too much money and far too many big egos"". However, the data from the Football Association (FA) also suggests the amount of yellow cards given for fouls per women's match is creeping up. It went from 1.3 per game in 2016-17 to 1.5 in the following year and 1.6 last season. Frampton believes an increase in rule-breaking is inevitable as women's football becomes more popular. ""The women's game is becoming far more professional, and by that happening, the skill factor, the determination and challenge of the game is getting much higher,"" she said. ""Women's football has become far more important, and that's going to bring the more competitive edge, which is going to bring tougher challenges and more cards,"" she added. So if the upward trend continues, it won't be long until the women are making Zinedine Zidane's head-butt look like an Eskimo kiss. Only kidding. There's no way you can make that infamous moment look any less brutal. 4. Global competition Men's World Cup winners have only ever come from eight countries across two continents - Europe and South America. There have been four times as many men's World Cups as women's, but the women's tournament has already produced four countries as winners from North America, Europe and Asia. The greater number of teams with a genuine chance to lift that treasured golden trophy arguably makes the women's game all the more exciting. 5. LGBT+ support It's a widely accepted shame that there is not one openly gay footballer in the Premier League. In 1990, former England Under-21 international Justin Fashanu was the first professional footballer in Britain to come out as gay. The ex-Aston Villa midfielder Thomas Hitzlsperger, who came out following his retirement in 2014, said there is a ""long way to go"" before men come out while playing in a top league. By contrast, the women's game is considered far more inclusive. When ex-England player Casey Stoney spoke out about being gay for the first time just months after Hitzlsperger, she said homosexuality was more accepted in the women's game. And West Ham United women's captain Gilly Flaherty said last season: ""Everyone has accepted me for who I am. Women's football is a sport where a player can be openly gay and no one acts any differently towards you because of it, which is a great thing."" The better levels of tolerance and acceptance in the women's game could be partly thanks to pioneer, Lily Parr. The 6ft chain-smoker - whose wages from Dick, Kerr Ladies FC, were reputedly supplemented by packets of Woodbine cigarettes - was gay, although some dispute how open she was about this. Parr paved the way for English women's footballing success and was the first woman to feature in the National Football Museum's Hall of Fame. Are England women better than men? In the last three Women's World Cups, England came third once and got into the final eight twice. The men finished fourth in 2018, were knocked out of the group stages in 2014 and made the final 16 in 2010. The stats behind these results show an almost identical track record. In 2018 England men scored 12 goals in seven matches, while the women scored 10 in seven matches in the 2015 tournament. Both teams received a total of eight yellow cards. The men conceded eight goals while the women conceded seven. It might be too tough to call which is the better team for now, but the women have everything to prove when they face Norway in the quarter-finals on Thursday. Watch this space - perhaps we'll be singing ""three Lionesses on a shirt"" and naming train stations after Phil Neville before the summer's over.","The widespread coverage and high drama of the Fifa Women's World Cup has sparked football fever across the UK, with a record-breaking 6.9 million people watching England's most recent clash. There were still far more people watching men's World Cup matches, with 26.5 million viewers tuning in to see England knocked out last year. But there are some ways women's football is hitting the back of the net - while the male strand of the sometimes-beautiful game bounces disappointingly off the crossbar."
"An effort to raise cash for a role-playing video game was exposed as a fraud by users of Reddit, Something Awful and other sites. The project had $4,739 (£2,922) in pledges out of a target of $80,000 at the point it was pulled by its creator. Kickstarter could not provide comment at this time. The site has successfully funded nearly 22,000 schemes since it was created in 2009. Mythic offers Mythic: The Story of Gods and Men had promised ""gameplay characteristics will be similar to that of World of Warcraft and the graphics quality should be up there with Skyrim"". The commitment to compete on an equal footing with big budget titles and a claim that ""animations will be done via motion capture thanks to some friends at Disney/Pixar"" raised suspicions. The scheme also offered supporters the chance of being motion captured so that they could appear as a ""god"" in the game, a life-sized sword and a copy of the soundtrack recorded ""at the Disney Studios"" if they gave enough money. Internet users subsequently reported that teaser screenshots had been copied from unrelated concept art and graphic design tutorial websites. 'Worried' No money transferred hands as Kickstarter only charges backers' credit cards if a project attracts enough support before a time limit expires. However, some users have raised concerns about whether the site was doing enough to vet applicants. ""What worried me the most is how Kickstarter allowed this to be posted in the first place,"" wrote David Kononen on the site's comments page. ""A simple Google search, and I found out for myself this was very shady."" The person responsible for the scam may have been trying to capitalise on the success of another video game.

That sum has since been eclipsed by Pebble, an effort to build an e-paper based watch which has raised close to $7.7m in pledges, smashing its $100,000 goal with more than a fortnight to go before its deadline.",Crowdsourced funding site Kickstarter has suffered its first publicised scam.
"But despite the cameras, sensors and radars being introduced, it is still expected to be years before the vehicles become fully self-driving. Tesla introduced its Autopilot system last year, allowing some self-drive functions such as auto-braking. But it is now temporarily disabling Autopilot on all new cars to allow ""robust"" testing with the new systems. Gathering data Tesla founder Elon Musk said its hardware was ""basically a super-computer in a car,"" but added it would be up to regulators and the public to decide when self-driving vehicles could actually be used on the roads. He said it made sense to build in the self-driving tech now - even if it cannot be used for some time - because trying to retrofit the hardware at a later stage would cost consumers more than buying a new vehicle. For now, the hardware will run in ""shadow mode"", gathering information on when the technology may have caused or avoided accidents had it been in command of the vehicle. Mr Musk said he hoped that Tesla could one day show regulators significant data which demonstrated the self-driving technology was safer than having humans behind the wheel. Investor confidence boost - Dave Lee, BBC North America technology reporter This is a statement of intent from Elon Musk but there's no real technological leap. Google and pretty much everyone else in this game has the necessary sensor technology at the ready, but the research and development task in making the computer smart enough to intelligently work out what is going on around it. That's what's holding self-driving technology back right now. What Tesla will gain by doing this, however, is a huge fleet of cars gathering data on the world's roads, something which could hasten the introduction of self-driving technology. It's an announcement that seems more designed to keep up investor confidence that Tesla is still worth backing despite missing sales and revenue targets over the past year. He'd promised they'd be comfortably making a profit by now, but he certainly hasn't managed that. Press attack Tesla has an Autopilot feature in its Model S and Model X vehicles, allowing them to automatically change lanes and keep up with traffic. But it suffered a setback in May when a man was killed driving a Tesla Model S while using the Autopilot function. A preliminary US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) report into the incident said the driver had been speeding moments before he collided with a lorry. Mr Musk was critical of press coverage of this and other related Autopilot accidents, saying there had been a ""paucity of media coverage of the 1.2 million people that die every year in manual crashes"". He claimed that publishing such negative stories risked dissuading people from using autonomous car tech, which would result in deaths. To underline the point, he retweeted an account of how Autopilot had prevented a Tesla Model X rear-ending another car. But one expert said it was right that critical articles be published. ""It's a revolutionary technology, so it's inevitable that it will attract a lot of attention,"" said Prof David Bailey from Aston Business School. ""If it was positive attention he wouldn't be complaining. But the point is that the press will pick up on things that go wrong, and things will go wrong. ""This technology will radically change the way we get around our cities, and as it's introduced it's absolutely right that it be scrutinised both by policy makers and the media."" New customers In its last set of financial results, Tesla said it had missed production targets, saw sales below expectations and reported its thirteenth consecutive quarterly loss. In April, Tesla unveiled plans for its Model 3 vehicle, its lowest-cost to date, due for release next year. It has been reported that so far 400,000 have been pre-ordered. That vehicle will now also include the new hardware. The basic model will start at $35,000 (£28,500) and have a range of at least 215 miles (346km) per charge. Analysts say the price and range of the five-seater should make the vehicle appeal to new types of customers and could boost interest in other electric vehicles. The firm faces competition from other similarly priced electric cars that will become available first, including General Motors' Chevy Bolt and BYD's Qin EV300.",Electric carmaker Tesla says all cars it now builds will have hardware needed to drive completely on their own.
"HBO also said Saturday's online leaks of four episodes had come from within a group that had received preview DVDs. Twitter maintains that the Periscope app complies with US copyright law. But HBO indirectly criticised the video streaming company. ""In general, we feel developers should have tools which proactively prevent mass copyright infringement from occurring on their apps and not be solely reliant upon notifications,"" HBO said in a statement. Periscope's terms and conditions make it clear that users should respect intellectual property rights, but the app currently only reacts to copyright infringement allegations rather than trying to prevent them happening in the first place, HBO believes. The long-awaited series five of Game of Thrones aired in the US on Sunday and in Europe on Monday. 'Hundreds of millions' Copyright infringement has been a huge issue for HBO. Episodes of the first four series of Game of Thrones were illegally downloaded more than seven million times between 5 February and 6 April this year, according to piracy specialist Irdeto, as marketing for the new series ramped up. This was a 45% increase on the same period last year, the company said. But over the history of the series, illegal downloads had run into the ""hundreds of millions"", Ernesto Van der Sar, of the Torrentfreak news website, said. And the first episode of the new series had been downloaded up to five million times, he said. ""In my view, Periscope is a non-issue [for Game of Thrones] because the show is already posted online at very high quality on several other services,"" he says. ""But mobile live streaming could be more of an issue for live sporting events like football matches.""","Games of Thrones broadcaster HBO has sent ""take down"" notices to Periscope, the live-streaming video app owned by Twitter, after users of the app broadcast episodes of the hit show on Sunday night."
"A judge in Dallas, Texas, agreed to protect the firm's assets and temporarily halt two US lawsuits while bankruptcy proceedings occur in Japan. The firm filed for bankruptcy in Japan in February after losing about $473m (£284m) worth of customers' bitcoins to what it says was a hacking attack. Mt Gox is scheduled to return to court on 1 April to extend the protections. The firm filed for Chapter 15 protection in the US late on Sunday. The filing asks the US bankruptcy court to recognize Mt Gox's bankruptcy in Japan and protect its US assets. 'Massive fraud' And it gives Mt Gox a temporary reprieve against two US lawsuits: one a class-action suit in Chicago filed by an Illinois resident, and another a $75m breach-of-contract case filed in Seattle by Coinlab Inc. At the time of the Mt Gox theft, about 750,000 customer bitcoins were stolen as well as close to 100,000 of Mt Gox's own bitcoins. That amounts to about 7% of all the bitcoins in existence. Steven Woodrow, the lawyer leading the Chicago class-action suit, told Judge Harlin Hale that the case was a ""massive fraud"". Mt Gox's attorney, David Parham, denied there was any fraud and said the firm and its founder, Mark Karpeles, were complying with the terms of the Japanese bankruptcy proceeding.",Troubled Japanese bitcoin exchange Mt Gox has won temporary bankruptcy protection in the US.
"The local publisher, Tencent, said the intervention had followed ""a large number of complaints"", but did not detail what they were about. The firm had previously said more than one million players had pre-ordered the title ahead of its 8 August release. The move coincided with reports that the news discussions site Reddit had also been blocked in the country. There has been no official statement about Reddit- and it is not unusual for China to block sites temporarily - but some human rights activists have suggested that such a ban was inevitable. Dragon killing Monster Hunter World requires players to stalk, battle and slay a variety of fantasy beasts, but is far from being the most violent video game. It was originally developed by Japan's Capcom, and is the latest instalment in a long-running series. In Europe it has a Pegi age rating of 16 for moderate gore and mild bad language. Tencent said it had already made changes to the title to make it suitable for the Chinese market, and the local regulators had granted this version a local sales licence in March. Tencent is now offering buyers a full refund if they make a claim before Monday morning. Those who decline can continue to play the game if they have already downloaded it, but they have been warned that there is no guarantee it will continue working when updates are made to the firm's WeGame platform. China has banned dozens of video games in the past - typically for featuring excessive violence, drug-taking or sex. The plots of some titles have also fallen foul of the censors. For example, Battlefield 4 was judged to have smeared the country's image after an expansion featured a rogue Chinese military leader attempting to overthrow the government. But it is very unusual for a game to be outlawed after having already been approved. Tencent's shares closed more than 3.4% below their opening price on Hong Kong's markets. Poisonous play The South China Morning Post newspaper reported that the ban comes in the midst of a hiatus in the issuance of local video game licences, with the Chinese authorities not having approved any titles since late March. This has affected Tencent's ability to make money from another high-profile import: PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG). The firm has already released two mobile versions of the survival game in China, but has yet to be given permission to sell in-game items within them. Tencent also faced problems last year when its previous bestseller - Honour of Kings - was criticised by the state media for being addictive. One editorial likened the game to ""poison"". The company responded by limiting the amount of time under-18s can play each day.",Monster Hunter World - the blockbuster video game - has been banned by China's censors just days after going on sale.
"The web giant fired the three, along with a fourth person who was not arrested. Baidu's spokeswoman, Betty Tian, said the sums involved amounted to ""tens of thousands of yuan"" (thousands of pounds). It is not known what posts were deleted. ""Baidu has always firmly cracked down on the illegal behaviour of online posts deletion for payment,"" Ms Tian wrote in an email to the BBC. ""Baidu has also proactively reported actions involving illegal behaviour to the public security organs. ""We have established that we will not accept any payment in handling online user complaints. ""Baidu has continuously provided professional ethics education to staff members who are given authority to delete online posts."" Illegal agencies Baidu, as well as other Chinese web companies and foreign websites aiming to operate in China, has to comply with the country's strict internet regulations. Known as The Great Firewall, the system bans a number of foreign web services in the communist nation and imposes strict censorship and self-censorship rules. There are a number of illegal agencies in China that promise to delete controversial or negative online content on behalf of companies or individuals. To deal with unwanted web posts legally, companies such as US-based Reputation.com specialise in creating positive content, which is meant to come up higher in the search results.","Three employees of China's main search engine, Baidu, have been arrested on suspicion of having accepted bribes to delete posts from its forum service."
"The allegations were made by Qihoo, a well-known cyber-security firm based in Beijing. The company said it had found evidence in malware suggesting the CIA had targeted airlines, petrol companies and government agencies. The BBC has contacted the CIA for comment. Qihoo said it had analysed malicious code and found similarities between it and information about alleged CIA hacking tools which was published three years ago. Among other alleged targets of the hacking campaign were internet firms, scientific institutions and energy companies. ""We speculate that in the past 11 years of infiltration attacks, CIA may have already grasped the most classified business information of China, even of many other countries in the world,"" added Qihoo. In recent years, we have become used to private cyber-security companies, and then Western governments, calling out espionage by other states - with China often in the firing line. Many private cyber-security companies, though, are still wary of publicly linking a particular hacking group to a foreign state. This new report is a sign that Chinese companies are willing to hit back at the US and the CIA. One thing making it easier for them is the fact that the CIA lost control of some of its most sensitive hacking tools, which were leaked onto the web. That allowed others to recognise them being used by the CIA - or, perhaps, by people using them to falsely implicate the US. At times, reports by US cyber-security companies appear to have dovetailed with US policy. The same might be true in this case, as China seeks to push back. China has urged the US to give a clear explanation of any hacking activities, and make cyber-space peaceful and safe. In March 2017, a trove of documents was published by WikiLeaks, that appeared to reveal a number of CIA hacking tools. The documents suggested the agency had developed ways of eavesdropping on smartphones and smart devices with built-in microphones. ""It is already known that the US has an offensive cyber-capability,"" said James Sullivan at the London-based Royal United Services Institute. ""Whether this particular example is true or not, it still raises questions about the ethics of offensive cyber and the licence to operate.""","The Chinese Foreign Ministry has asked the US for a ""clear explanation"" after claims the CIA had been hacking targets in China for at least 11 years."

"The annual home broadband report says the average home speed is now 64 megabits per second (Mbps), up from 54.2Mbps the year before. The 18% boost is in line with growth in previous years. Data for the report was gathered in November 2019, but updated with changes during the coronavirus lockdown, when speeds fell by 2%. Ofcom says the small decrease shows that performance ""is holding up well"" during the pandemic, despite the increased demand. The government began to ask people to stay at home on 16 March, so the speeds from the last week of March were compared to the beginning of the month. Virgin Media was the worst affected, with speed dipping by nearly 10% at one point - although the report noted that since Virgin has higher speeds than most providers, customers were unlikely to have noticed. The Ofcom report is compiled from a panel of volunteers who have the speeds measured from their routers, and is considered to be a very accurate way of measuring the data. Superfast connections The main body of the report, which covers the data from 2019, found that nearly three-quarters of UK homes have what Ofcom considers ""superfast"" broadband packages of 30Mpbs or higher. Real-world connection speeds are slightly lower, with 69% of people achieving 30Mbps or more. That includes the 17% of homes on 100Mbps or higher, and 3% achieve more than 300Mbps. On the lower end, 13% of homes are still on connections of 10mbps or less, and another 18% have speeds between 10-30mbps. Those numbers all refer to the proportion of people who are actually getting those speeds - not how widely available they are. The speeds and packages available to homes still depend on their physical address. Rural broadband, for example, broadly remains slower than the same technology in urban areas. Old-style ADSL (Asymmetric digital subscriber line) connections over copper wire, for example, are 36% higher in cities than outside them. But the gap between rural and urban connections is narrowing, the report found. Ofcom also launched a separate report on the same day on broadband availability - what is offered to homes, rather than what speeds are actually achieved. Full-fibre broadband is up by a fifth since last year, but is still only accessible to 12% of homes. Ultrafast broadband availability (300mpbs or higher) crept upward by 2% to 55% of households.","The average broadband speed in the UK rose by 18% last year, regulator Ofcom says."
"Combining image recognition and artificial intelligence, the system would be able to distinguish between drunk and sober pictures. It would ask: ""Are you sure you want your boss and your mother to see this?"" The plan was revealed by the head of Facebook's artificial intelligence research lab. Speaking to Wired magazine, Yann LeCun said he wanted to build a Facebook digital assistant. In the future, this assistant might also be able to help identify when someone else has uploaded a picture of a user without permission, he said. Facebook already uses image recognition technology to help identify faces and allow users to tag them correctly. Controversial Increasingly the firm is using the technology in conjunction with artificial intelligence software. AI is already being used to examine overall Facebook behaviour in order to identify the right content for news feeds, Mr LeCun told Wired. The next stage will be to analyse text in posted statuses and automatically suggest relevant hashtags. He also spoke about a future where an intelligent digital assistant could ""mediate your interaction with your friends"". Such a future is likely to prove controversial, with both consumers and privacy advocates who will demand that such services are opt-in rather than offered as a default. Many big tech firms are experimenting with AI. Google has its own AI labs and has been investing heavily in AI and robotics firms.",Facebook is working on software that could prevent users posting unflattering photos of themselves.
"The six-wheeled robots from Starship Technologies will be used to collect parcels rather than deliver them. The project follows a pilot scheme in Germany in which the robots delivered parcels to several suburbs in the city of Hamburg. But one expert suggested there might be a backlash if the facility became commonplace. ""At the moment, in big cities, it can be hard to walk down the street because of the number of people,"" commented Prof Andy Miah, from the University of Salford's School of Environment and Life Sciences. ""In time, it could be the robots we are trying to dodge. I'm not sure that would be a better world."" Starship Technologies' machines are already used by Just Eat for food deliveries in parts of London. They are 55cm (22in) tall and 70cm (28in) long. They weigh 18kg (40lb), and can travel at up to 4mph (6.4km/h). Hermes is only using the robots within a two-mile radius of its control centres, in a limited number of 30-minute collection slots to see how they cope with tight turnarounds. Each robot will be able to carry a maximum of 10kg in cargo in a secure compartment, which customers can access using a code sent to their smartphones. Smooth ride The self-driving robots are thought to have several advantages over aerial drones, from being able to carry heavier payloads to being less likely to fall foul of aviation laws. ""In the sky, we still have to figure out what a drone highway would look like and figure out some sophisticated collision-avoidance technology,"" noted Prof Miah. By contrast, Starship's ground-based robots will be kept under close supervision by human operators. Each supervisor will watch over three robots via their on-board cameras and take control of road-crossings and other challenging situations. In time, however, Starship says one operator should be able to control up to 100 robots, which would make its operation more cost effective.",Courier company Hermes has announced a trial of self-driving robots in the London borough of Southwark.
"By Mark WardTechnology correspondent, BBC News That is the name of the virtual crypto-currency I created to see how easy it is to leap on the virtual cash bandwagon. That bandwagon briefly propelled each Bitcoin, the best known crypto-currency, to be worth about $1,200 (£715). Currently each virtual coin trades for much less than half of the value of that November 2013 peak. It is a bandwagon that others, notably Litecoin and Dogecoin, have jumped on to as well. More are leaping aboard every day according to figures gathered by crypto-cash tracking site Cryptsy which currently lists more than 170 virtual currencies. ""Most of the new crypto-currencies which have come into existence since the advent of Bitcoin are basically Bitcoin-duplicates with a different brand name,"" says economic historian Garrick Hileman from the London School of Economics. ""Because Bitcoin is open source anyone is free to 'copy and paste' Bitcoin's core software protocol to create a new crypto-currency."" Many of those newer virtual currencies have sought to outdo Bitcoin by sharpening up the computer code behind the currency to avoid some of the technical troubles that dog the market leader, he says. BBC bucks Talking about alternative crypto-currencies, which are known as alt-coins, made me wonder how easy it is to create one. Jeff Garzik, one of Bitcoin's core developers, told me; ""It is trivial to create your own currency. It doesn't really take much programming skill, even."" Mr Garzik pointed me towards Matt Corallo who is behind the Coingen.io website that makes it very straightforward to roll your own money. The first step was to get hold of some Bitcoins to pay the small fee Mr Corallo charges for a copy of the coin-generating software. This proved a hurdle because it is difficult to buy Bitcoins quickly. I was keen to put a layer of security between me and whoever I bought them from so ended up using the Barclays Pingit app on a smartphone to buy coins via the BitBargain website. With Bitcoins safely in my digital wallet I transferred a few to Mr Corallo and, like many hundreds of others, filled in the form that defined how my coin, now dubbed Beebcoins, would work. I decided there would be a maximum of 21 million Beebcoins, picked an abbreviation (BBC), uploaded a logo and made some choices about the technical innards of the Beebcoin system. The next step was to install the software on several computers and then get them talking to each other to form the little network needed to mine the coins. Crypto-currencies are inherently community-based and I happen to have enough computers at home, seven at the last count, to form that community and get mining. Coingen provides precious little in terms of support so I scoured the web for help and found a checklist to run through to get the network humming. I typed commands into the command line, helped the machines see each other and connect on my home network and got each one doing the complicated maths to generate coins. Within 20 minutes the first message popped up telling me some coins had been mined. Sadly, that did not mean I could spend or share them straight away. Instead the Beebcoins had to ""mature"" - this meant that any computer had to complete a lot more mining work before it was rewarded. There is no free lunch with an alt-coin. In total, it took the machines I used more than six hours running at full speed to complete the work needed to get those coins to mature. I now have thousands of the things. I wonder what I've spent in electricity to do all that work? It struck me then that if I wanted to turn Beebcoins into an actual currency it would take much more than just computers. It would require a marketing job to get people to value the coin and back it with more computers or even real cash. Also needed would be people with far better web-programming skills than mine to add a friendlier layer to that virtual cash-generating system. The sheer hard work involved in getting beyond the basics was exposed by tech news site Ars Technica which created its own crypto-currency - Ars Coins. It recruited a few developers to help and even so hit real problems when it rolled out the currency to readers. Solving them and then getting people to buy in was hard. Even then the only reward it could offer Ars Coin miners was special icons on messages they post to the magazine's discussion forums. For me the Beebcoin experience has given me a greater understanding of how crypto-currencies work and why some of them fail and others succeed. The value of these virtual currencies lies, like the real things, in what people are willing to pay for them. That's perhaps why so many of these alt-coins revolve around an online community as people are already invested in that group and have a ready need to reward the good behaviour of other members. At the moment, Beebcoins have zero monetary value unless there is someone out there that wants to take the network off my hands. One careful owner. All offers considered. Going cheap.","I am the richest person in the world but, sadly, only when it comes to Beebcoins."
"SoftBank, the company behind the robot, is planning to release 1,000 robots every month. Pepper will sell for 198,000 yen (£1,000), and businesses will be able to rent it for 1,500 yen an hour. Robotic expert Prof Noel Sharkey said SoftBank's business strategy was ""risky"". Although the upfront price is relatively cheap for a sophisticated robot - SoftBank is actually selling it at below manufacturing costs - customers will also have to pay monthly service fees of up to 24,000 yen and sign up to a three-year contract. ""SoftBank is hoping to make money from apps, but it is risky as it is not clear whether anyone will develop any for it,"" said Prof Sharkey, from the University of Sheffield. There will be 100 apps available for download at launch. The robots will be manufactured by FoxConn. Chinese online retailer Alibaba is also partnering. Both are investing $118m in SoftBank's robotic division and will take 20% shares in the company. Over-hyped No date has yet been set for when Pepper will go on sale outside of Japan, but Softbank chief executive Masayoshi Son said it would probably happen next year. Pepper can remember faces and is programmed to recognise human emotions. ""It looks excellent, and I think that it is good at conveying human-like gestures - but the way it detects human emotions might be over-hyped,"" said Prof Sharkey. ""I think that they are over-claiming on its speech functions, too. The conversations are very one-sided, and it asks a lot of questions,"" he added. Featuring more than 20 motors and highly articulated arms, Pepper is being touted as a household robot, assisting elderly people or for use in a family. But Prof Sharkey is not convinced it will be a hit with consumers. ""There is talk of it being an assistant, but it can't lift anything, so it is really a very limited companion,"" he said. Japan has a rising elderly population, and the government is keen to use technology to help ease its overburdened healthcare system. But the use of robotic assistants has not always gone well, according to Prof Sharkey. ""There is a big fuss when these things are launched in Japanese care homes, but go back after a year and they are in a cupboard,"" he said.","Pepper, the humanoid robot that its makers say can recognise and respond to human emotions, goes on sale in Japan this weekend."
"Named Emotive, it works by accessing the emotional content of postings on the social networking site. The team, from Loughborough University, say it can scan up to 2,000 tweets a second and rate them for expressions of one of eight human emotions. They claim Emotive could help calm civil unrest and identify early threats to public safety. More than 500 million people across the world use Twitter, and more than 340 million tweets are posted daily. The team, from the university's new Centre for Information Management, say the system can extract a direct expression of anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise, shame and confusion from each tweet. The academics said that using the Emotive software to geographically evaluate any mass mood could help police to track potential criminal behaviour or threats to public safety. It may be able to guide national policy on the best way to react to major incidents, they added. 'Sadness and disgust' Prof Tom Jackson, who led the research team, said that public postings through social media gave a very accurate real-time record of how and what people were feeling. ""Following the murder of solider Lee Rigby in Woolwich there was an outpouring of sadness and disgust through Twitter,"" he said. ""Across the country people expressed their emotions at this unprovoked attack, with some using the incident to incite racial hatred against Muslims. ""Two days after his murder his family appealed for calm, stating that their son would not have wanted his name to be used as an excuse to carry out attacks against others. ""This appeal had an almost immediate effect, leading to an outpour of positive sentiment."" Prof Jackson added: ""Twitter is a very concise platform through which users express how they feel about a particular event, be that a criminal act, a new government policy or even a change in the weather. ""Through the computer program we have created we can collate these expressions of feelings in real time, map them geographically and track how they develop."" Dr Ann O'Brien, who was part of the team that created the study for emotions used by the programme, said it could chart the strength of feeling expressed in both ordinary language and in slang. ""For any incident we can view how reactions grow and diminish over time,"" she said. The system is currently only being used to analyse tweets in the UK, but the researchers said it could easily be scaled up to monitor tweets globally.",British scientists have developed a computer program they say can map the mood of the nation using Twitter.
"By Zoe KleinmanTechnology reporter, BBC News The new rules, including the controversial Article 13, will hold tech firms responsible for material posted without copyright permission. Sharing memes and GIFs will still be allowed under the new laws. Many musicians and creators say the legislation will compensate artists fairly - but others argue that they will destroy user-generated content. Copyright is the legal right that allows an artist to protect how their original work is used. Tech companies have argued that artists are already paid fairly under the current system. Google said it would ""harm Europe's creative and digital industries"". High-profile figures who have campaigned against the EU Copyright Directive include Wyclef Jean and web inventor Sir Tim Berners Lee, while Debbie Harry and Sir Paul McCartney have been among its supporters. It has taken several revisions for the current legislation, which was was backed by 348 MEPs, with 274 against, to reach its final form. It is now up to member states to approve the decision. If they do, they will have two years to implement it once it is officially published. The two clauses causing the most controversy are known as Article 11 and Article 13. It means they would need to apply filters to content before it is uploaded. Article 13 does not include cloud storage services and there are already existing exemptions, including parody, which, for example, includes memes. Memes 'excluded' It was Article 13 which prompted fears over the future of memes and GIFs - stills, animated or short video clips that go viral - since they mainly rely on copyrighted scenes from TV and film. Critics claimed Article 13 would have made it nearly impossible to upload even the tiniest part of a copyrighted work to Facebook, YouTube, or any other site. However, specific tweaks to the law made earlier this year made memes safe ""for purposes of quotation, criticism, review, caricature, parody and pastiche"". The European Parliament said that memes would be ""specifically excluded"" from the directive, although it was unclear how tech firms would be able to enforce that rule with a blanket filter. MEP for London Mary Honeyball said: ""There's no problem with memes at all. This directive was never intended to stop memes and mashups. ""I think that's doom-mongering. People who carry out their business properly have nothing to worry about at all."" 'Massive blow' Robert Ashcroft, chief executive of PRS for Music, which collects royalties for music artists, welcomed the directive as ""a massive step forward"" for consumers and creatives. ""It's about making sure that ordinary people can upload videos and music to platforms like YouTube without being held liable for copyright - that responsibility will henceforth be transferred to the platforms,"" he said. However the campaign group Open Knowledge International described it as ""a massive blow"" for the internet. ""We now risk the creation of a more closed society at the very time we should be using digital advances to build a more open world where knowledge creates power for the many, not the few,"" said chief executive Catherine Stihler. Google said that while the latest version of the directive was improved, there remained ""legal uncertainty"". ""The details matter and we look forward to working with policy-makers, publishers, creators and rights holders, as EU member states move to implement these new rules,"" it said. Kathy Berry, senior lawyer at Linklaters, said more detail was required about how Article 13 would be enforced. ""While Article 13 may have noble aims, in its current form it functions as little more than a set of ideals, with very little guidance on exactly which service providers will be caught by it or what steps will be sufficient to comply,"" she said. European Parliament Rapporteur Axel Voss said the legislation was designed to protect people's livelihoods. ""This directive is an important step towards correcting a situation which has allowed a few companies to earn huge sums of money without properly remunerating the thousands of creatives and journalists whose work they depend on,"" he said. ""It helps make the internet ready for the future, a space which benefits everyone, not only a powerful few.""",Copyright laws which critics say could change the internet have been voted in by the European Parliament.
"By Dave LeeTechnology reporter, BBC News The BBA said there were 66 robberies in 2011, compared to 847 in 1992. The drop has been attributed to a raft of innovative technologies making it extremely difficult for ""traditional"" robbery tactics to work. ""Banks are working hard to confine armed robberies to the world of TV dramas,"" BBA chief Anthony Browne said. ""Being caught up in a bank job is a terrifying ordeal for staff and customers that can scar lives for decades. ""It's great to see that the number of these crimes have fallen sharply in recent years. Anyone trying to rob a bank now faces much better CCTV, protective screens that can rise in less than a second and even special fog designed to disperse criminals. ""Banks will continue to work closely with each other, post offices and the police to make such raids a thing of the past."" Disorientating fog A similar trend has been noted in the US, where FBI figures for 2012 put the number of bank robberies nationwide at 3,870 - the lowest in decades. In an effort to deter criminals and make branch workers safer, banks have made significant investments in security technology. These range from simple barriers - which drop down when a panic button is pressed - to special ""fog"" that disorientates criminals. ""DNA"" spray is another common deterrent - robbers are coated with a unique, traceable material that is extremely difficult to wash off skin and can prove that a suspect was at the premises of a robbery. Combined, the measures mean the risks outweigh any potential gains - particularly as bank branches typically store less cash on the premises than in previous years. Shift to online However, while brute-force bank robberies are dropping, banks - and their customers - are still under threat from crime. Official statistics from the Met Police confirm that business robberies were down 31% in London over the past decade, reports the BBC's business correspondent Joe Lynam, but some thieves have switched their focus to the vehicles that transport money between banks. More significant is the growing rate of cyber-crime relating to banks and other financial transactions. Recently, 40 million credit card details held by major US retail chain Target were compromised and are now being sold online. The attack, according to one security researcher, originated in Ukraine. In a separate attack, criminals based in New York obtained $45m (£29m) by accessing a database of information used by cash machines. Seven men were charged in May. Beyond bank details, hackers - the new generation of robbers - are also scooping up personal details and packaging them up to be sold on. Full dossiers of information about an individual, including bank details, are routinely sold on the online black market for around $30, a recent study suggested.

"By Rob CrossleyVideo games writer It will be the first title offered on the ""next-gen"" PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles - and if the trailer is anything to go by there's little doubt it will display the game's gruesome attacks in greater detail than ever before, causing fresh fuss. Even so, it will prove difficult to trigger the scale of outrage that accompanied the original game. In the summer of 1993, the Nintendo executive Howard Lincoln had come up with a controversial solution to an unavoidable problem. His company, renowned for creating entertainment that is cherished by children and trusted by parents, was preparing to release Mortal Kombat, considered one of the most violent games ever, on the Super Nintendo console. It was the equivalent of Disney distributing Reservoir Dogs, American Psycho on Sesame Street. Mortal Kombat was admired by critics but inevitably better known for its unashamed glorification of murder. It allowed combatants to rip the heart out of a vanquished foe, or tear the head off a fallen opponent, and hold the appendage up as a trophy. The game encouraged players to do this with the infamous message ""Finish him!"" that would repeatedly flash on the screen when a bout was over. How could a game like this, regardless of how popular it was, be sold on shelves next to Super Mario World? Go green Months after Mortal Kombat's initial release across arcades in October 1992, and before its port onto the Super Nintendo, Mr Lincoln met Acclaim chief executive Gregory Fischbach to offer a solution. ""Lincoln told us we needed to change the blood from red to green, which I thought was pretty stupid,"" Mr Fischbach tells the BBC. Not only that, but the game's fatalities would be edited, and various background details - such as heads impaled on spikes - would be completely removed. Mr Fischbach believes such decisions were rash, but was unable to block them. ""To my mind, Mortal Kombat was comic-book violence, but some people got upset about it. People looked at it as though we were selling it to nine-year-old children."" The wider issue was that Mortal Kombat had arrived during an era of transition for the games industry. What was considered a child's pursuit had begun to serve the interests of young adults and teenagers. Those audience clashes had naturally begun to manifest. ""It was the beginning of video games coming of age,"" says Mr Fischbach. ""At one point in time, games were just meant for children, and nobody really took them seriously. But it was with the launch of Mortal Kombat that people who controlled the media began to look at it differently."" Even though games such as Mortal Kombat, Doom and Night Trap were created for mature audiences, crucially there was no law preventing young people from accessing them. This led to thunderous denunciations from politicians and news media anchors alike. ""Part of the problem at the time was that the biggest distributor of games in the US was Toys R Us. The positioning in the marketplace was that games were designed for children, and not teenagers or young adults."" Blood money Nintendo's efforts to censor Mortal Kombat failed to put a lid on the controversy. Rival company Sega had also published the game on its own system, the Genesis (known as the Mega Drive in the UK), and via a cheat code allowed gamers to enjoy the gore-fuelled glories of the arcade original. According to Blake Harris, author of Console Wars, Sega's gamble paid off enormously. ""The net result was that the Sega Genesis version of Mortal Kombat outsold the Super Nintendo version five-to-one,"" he tells the BBC. It was the Genesis version that also caught the eye of one young Mortal Kombat fan who happened to be the son of a Capitol Hill aide. According to Mr Harris, this simple connection is what could have triggered the political outrage against violent video games. ""Bill Andresen, a former chief of staff to Senator Joe Lieberman, was asked by his son to buy Mortal Kombat. But when Andresen saw the game, he showed it to Lieberman, who was appalled by it."" Reform calls On 1 December 1993, Mr Lieberman gathered the Washington press corps to expose what he believed was the corrupting influence of video games on young minds. He played several VHS tapes, showcasing some of the goriest elements of games such as Mortal Kombat and Night Trap, and announced his intention to introduce a game age-ratings body. ""Few parents would buy these games for their kids if they knew what was in them,"" he said at the time. ""We're talking about video games that glorify violence and teach children to enjoy inflicting the most gruesome forms of cruelty imaginable."" John Tobias, one of the four developers who created Mortal Kombat, believed the reaction was harsh. ""Their lobbying never felt sincere. To me it always felt like scapegoating an industry they knew nothing about to pander for votes,"" he tells the BBC. ""Anyone who listened to the testimony or the questioning that went on and who knew anything about games understood that. ""Video games were not and never will be the great destructor of society they were trying to paint them to be."" One week after Mr Lieberman's press conference, the senator chaired a subcommittee on violent video games, insisting that the industry must introduce a system of self-regulation if it wanted to avoid state regulation. Within five months, the games industry established the pioneering Entertainment Software Rating Board, and one of its first acts was to assign Mortal Kombat a ""mature"" rating, meaning it was illegal for minors to purchase it. Moral panic These events, spurred by moral panic, painted the games industry in its most unflattering light, but nevertheless established a ratings code that is still adhered to today. Mortal Kombat 10, announced today, is certain to be the next entry in the series designated an M-rating. On reflection, Mr Fischbach believes the ratings reform ""was the right thing to do"". He says: ""It allowed game creators and publishers to focus on what they do, and allowed information to be displayed on game packaging that wasn't there before."" But Mr Harris believes that, however beneficial the outcome, the calls for game age ratings was not as driven by the public as often suggested. ""I think the outrage was mostly from the media. I think parents, for the most part, still didn't realise what video games were,"" he says. ""I could be wrong, but I spent three years researching this, and not once did I get the sense that people were spurred on by angry calls or angry letters from the parents. ""I mean, Lincoln told me that he got numerous angry letters from parents, but it was people complaining about Nintendo censoring their games. They didn't like the green blood. I think that tells you how much this issue was media-driven.""","Warner Bros has confirmed it plans to release Mortal Kombat X next year, the latest edition in a video game series that has stoked controversy and allured fighting fanatics for more than 20 years."
"Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent@BBCRoryCJon Twitter So, an experiment under way in a few countries, where the social media giant appears to be making it harder for users to see news stories, has caused something akin to panic. The new feature Facebook is trying out is called Explore. It offers all sorts of stories it thinks might interest you, a separate news feed encouraging you to look further afield than just at what your friends are sharing. Meanwhile, for most people, the standard News Feed remains the usual mixture of baby photos and posts from companies or media organisations whose pages you have liked. Sounds fine, doesn't it? Except that in six countries - Sri Lanka, Bolivia, Slovakia, Serbia, Guatemala, and Cambodia - the experiment went further. For users there, the main News Feed was cleared of everything but the usual stuff from your friends and sponsored posts - in other words, if you wanted to have your material seen in the place most users spend their time you had to pay for the privilege. In a Medium post entitled ""Biggest drop in organic reach we've ever seen"", a Slovakian journalist Filip Struharik documented the impact. Publishers in his country were seeing just a quarter of the interactions they used to get before the change, he said. What had become a vital and vibrant platform for them was emptying out fast. Other journalists around the world have looked into the future and hate what they see. Their organisations have become addicted to Facebook as the one true way of reaching audiences and going cold turkey would be very painful. Facebook is of course a business - and a hugely successful one - that makes its money from advertising. So, why would it not want publishers to pay to reach its gigantic audience? But Peter Kafka, a journalist from Recode, tweeted an even more depressing thought: ""Conspiracy angle: fb wants more $ from publishers! More accurate, and dispiriting angle (for publishers): fb doesn't care about publishers."" Facebook responded as it often does by saying calm down, dears, it was just a bit of fun. As the wave of panic rolled around the news media world, the social network's head of newsfeed Adam Mosseri put up a post with the title Clarifying Recent Tests. It explained that the experiment is aimed at understanding whether people prefer to have separate places for personal and public content. ""We currently have no plans to roll this test out further,"" he added. This has not helped much - that word ""currently"" seems to stick out ominously. But at least Facebook has done publishers big and small a service. They knew the risks involved in innovations such as Instant Articles - where their works live on the social network - or Facebook Live - where a broadcaster's brand might be less visible to many users. Now they know that Facebook is at least thinking about a future where news plays a smaller role in the social media experience. Given Facebook's role in last year's US elections, some may think that's a good thing. But for thousands of struggling media organisations that thought they had found a route forward, it is a chilling prospect.",It used to be a tweak in the Google search algorithm that sent a shudder through newsrooms trying to adapt to the online era. Now it is any change in the design of Facebook.
"The service allows users to keep checklists and voice notes, and annotate photos. The digital memo market is a burgeoning one and the offering will put Google head to head with services such as Evernote. Experts predict that Google might have entered the market a little too late. Memory aid services are striking a chord with consumers and employees who are increasingly swamped by information. Current market leader Evernote has 15 million active users. Microsoft has a similar product - OneNote - and there are smaller rivals such as Springpad and Catch. Now it seems Google wants a piece of the action. ""Every day we all see, hear or think of things we need to remember. Usually we grab a pad of sticky notes, scribble a reminder and put it on the desk, the fridge or the relevant page of a magazine,"" said Google software engineer Katherine Kuan in a blog post. Keep is Google's attempt to turn this ad-hoc notetaking into a more efficient digital service. ""With Keep you can quickly jot ideas down when you think of them and even include checklists and photos to keep track of what's important to you,"" she added. The information is stored in Google Drive. Users can also speak memos and Keep transcribes them. And there is a search facility for people to quickly find what they are looking for. Currently Keep is available only via the web or as an app for phones and tablets running Android 4.0 or above. '800lb gorilla' But with little to differentiate it from competitors, some feel Google may struggle to make an impact. ""My gut instinct is that Google may have come too late to this. It has a track record - with cloud services and social networking - of coming too late and struggling to make an impact,"" said Chris Green, principal technology analyst at Davies Murphy Group. ""But, if anyone can make an impact, it will be Google,"" he added. ""If there is a 800lb gorilla like Google behind you you are going to be worried. Evernote cannot rest on its laurels but it does have a huge user base and they are not all going to desert it overnight."" Tony Cripps, analyst at research firm Ovum, thinks Google might benefit from the fact that many already use its myriad services. ""If you are a converted Google user it represents a good option. There is a level of convenience about having access to a range of services using one log-in,"" he said. ""I use Evernote but I'll give this a spin and see if it works for me.""","Anyone who has ever jotted down a note on the back of an envelope and promptly lost it might be interested in Google's latest offering, Keep."
"By Chris FoxTechnology reporter He said the platform ""unfairly"" reduced the visibility of 600,000 accounts, including some members of Congress. But he was unable to immediately say whether a majority of them were Republican, Democratic or otherwise. Mr Dorsey is being questioned by senators over allegations that Twitter censors conservative voices. Several Republicans, including US President Donald Trump, have accused Twitter of bias, which the company denies. ""Twitter does not use political ideology to make any decisions, whether related to ranking content on our service or how we enforce our rules,"" said Mr Dorsey. However, he said the company had made mistakes. On Wednesday, the US Department of Justice said it would investigate ""growing concern that these companies may be hurting competition and intentionally stifling the free exchange of ideas on their platforms"". What is the Twitter hearing about? Allegations of censorship were fuelled when Twitter added a ""quality filter"" to the platform and its search results. Some users noticed that their tweets no longer appeared in search results and suggested that their content was being hidden, known as a ""shadow ban"". Mr Dorsey told senators that the platform used ""hundreds of signals"" to decide ""what to show, down-rank and filter"". ""We do not shadow-ban anyone based on political ideology,"" he said. He explained that the algorithm had acted on the behaviour of people following accounts - so some politicians were punished for the behaviour of their followers. ""It was unfair"", said Mr Dorsey. ""We corrected it."" Several senators in the hearing said the investigation was a waste of time. Democrat Paul Sabanes said the hearing had been triggered by ""deep-state conspiracy theories proffered by the president"" while fellow Democrat Jerry McNerney said it was an effort by Republicans to motivate their voters. ""President Trump and many Republicans have peddled conspiracy theories about Twitter and other social media platforms to whip up their base and fundraise,"" said Democrat Frank Pallone. Mr Pallone said Twitter could not be accused of anti-conservative bias while it allowed President Trump to use it for ""juvenile tweets and misinformation"". What else did Mr Dorsey reveal?","Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey has told US lawmakers the company's algorithms have not always been ""impartial""."
"The firm's DeepMind division says that it played 100 games against Stockfish 8, and won or drew all of them. The research has yet to be peer reviewed. But experts already suggest the achievement will strengthen the firm's position in a competitive sector. ""From a scientific point of view, it's the latest in a series of dazzling results that DeepMind has produced,"" the University of Oxford's Prof Michael Wooldridge told the BBC. ""The general trajectory in DeepMind seems to be to solve a problem and then demonstrate it can really ramp up performance, and that's very impressive."" DeepMind has previously defeated several of the world's top human players of the Chinese board game Go, as well as teaching itself how to play video games including Pong and Space Invaders. The London-based team is currently trying to develop a system that can beat humans at the space strategy game Starcraft, which is seen as being an even more complex challenge. Thinking time Google is not commenting on the research until it is published in a journal. However, details published on Cornell University's Arxiv site state that an algorithm dubbed AlphaZero was able to outperform Stockfish just four hours after being given the rules of chess and being told to learn by playing simulations against itself. In the 100 games that followed, each program was given one minute's worth of thinking time per move. AlphaZero won 25 games in which it played with white pieces, giving it the first move, and a further three in which it played with black pieces. The two programs drew the remaining 72 games. DeepMind described the level of performance achieved as being ""superhuman"". Google highlighted that Stockfish 8 had previously won 2016's Top Chess Engine Championship. The software was first released in 2008 and has been built on by volunteers in the years since. The open source project has been beaten by another program, Komodo, in two major computer chess challenges this year. Even so, one human chess grandmaster was still hugely impressed by DeepMind's victory. ""I always wondered how it would be if a superior species landed on earth and showed us how they played chess,"" Peter Heine Nielsen told the BBC. ""Now I know."" Open v closed AlphaGo Zero's latest achievements do not rest on chess alone. The paper says it was also triumphant in the Japanese board game Shogi versus a leading artificial intelligence program named Elmo, after two hours of self-training. The AlphaZero algorithm won 90 games, drew two and lost eight. Furthermore, after eight hours of self-training it was also able to beat the previous version of itself at Go - winning 60 games and losing 40. Prof Wooldridge noted that all three games were fairly ""closed"" in the sense they had limited sets of rules to contend with. ""In the real world we don't know what is round the corner,"" he explained. ""Coping when you don't know what is coming is much more complicated, and things will get even more exciting when DeepMind moves on to more open problems."" The University of Bath's AI expert Prof Joanna Bryson added that people should be cautious about buying too deeply into the firm's hype. But she added that its knack for good publicity had put it in a strong position against challengers. ""It's not only about hiring the best programmers,"" she said. ""It's also very political, as it helps makes Google as strong as possible when negotiating with governments and regulators looking at the AI sector.""",Google says its AlphaGo Zero artificial intelligence program has triumphed at chess against world-leading specialist software within hours of teaching itself the game from scratch.
"By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor It means the Xperia Z5 Premium can both capture video in ""ultra-high definition"" quality and then play it back on its 5.5in (14cm) display without downgrading the footage. All the firm's Z5 handsets also feature a new camera module - the first time the part has been completely overhauled since 2013's original Z1 handset. Sony's mobile division loses money, but its camera components are profitable. Apple, Samsung, Xiaomi and Huawei are among rival handset-makers to have used earlier generations of the Japanese company's photo-capture technologies. However, Sony said the 23 megapixel sensor involved was being kept as an ""exclusive"" to its own devices for the time being. The company recently forecast its handset business would rack up a 60bn yen ($500m; £326m) operating loss in its current financial year. But it forecast its image sensor wing - which also makes parts for bigger cameras - would generate 580bn yen ($4.8bn; £3.1bn) of sales over the same period. Sony hopes its mobile phones will become profitable again in 2016, but its chief executive told the BBC in March that there was ""no guarantee"" it would still be making handsets in five years' time if a turnaround failed to happen. Big battery Sony unveiled its new Android-powered handsets at Berlin's Ifa tech show. The company acknowledged that there was still a limited amount of professional content available in 4K - which provides about four times the number of pixels as 1080p high definition video. But it said the Z5 Premium would upscale videos streamed from YouTube and Netflix to take advantage of the display. One of the big concerns about high-definition screens is that they run down batteries more quickly. Sony says its use of a ""high capacity"" 3,430 mAh battery and memory-on-display tech - which allows a static image to remain on show without requiring extra processing power - should mean the handset lasts for ""up to two days"" between charges. But one expert still had concerns. ""I really doubt it will last two days if you watch a 4K movie on the device,"" said Francisco Jeronimo from the tech research company IDC. ""There's not really a need for a 4K display from a consumers point-of-view. ""But this is really about offering something outstanding that its competitors can't provide today and raising brand awareness."" Low light Sony's new camera module benefits from the introduction of a ""closed-loop actuator"" stabilisation system. This adds a position sensor to the part, which is used to detect small disturbances and then compensate for them by making the lens move up and down in its housing in a related fashion. As a result, it should be able to film less jerky video clips. The addition of a sixth camera element causes more light to fall on to the sensor, which should aid low-light photography. Sony has also added more ""phase-detection"" pixels to the sensor. These are used to speed up autofocus and now cover the complete frame rather than just its central area. The result is that the sensor can react more quickly to action occurring on the edge of shot. The company says this and other improvements mean the camera is capable of refocusing in 0.03 seconds, making it ""the fastest autofocus in a smartphone"". However, Mr Jeronimo doubts whether most users will appreciate the innovations. ""The big question is whether consumers will perceive the added quality when they take a picture,"" he said. ""I took a few pictures with an iPhone 6 and the new Sony Z5 Premium in low light, and to be honest the quality was very similar. ""Once you get to a certain level, it becomes very difficult to notice the difference unless you print the picture in a large size, and that's true for most of the top-end handsets."" Nonetheless, he added, the sensor had a good chance of being adopted by other smartphone companies if it proved superior in independent tests to alternatives. Its competition will include Samsung's recently announced S5K3P3 sensor, which has a lower resolution of 16 megapixels but has been designed to be very thin to offer ""minimal camera protrusion"" from slimline handsets. Fruit phone Other companies that launched new smartphones at Ifa on Wednesday included:",Sony has unveiled the first smartphone to feature a 4K-resolution screen.
"Kicked off by Audi, the system aims to end the frustration of missing the arrival of a package being delivered to home or work. Instead, Audi owners will be able to use their car as a shipping address for items ordered online. A pilot project to test the system is planned to take place in May in Munich. Using Audi's in-car communications system, Connect, DHL delivery drivers would track a customer's vehicle over a specified period of time and then use a digital access code to unlock the boot, the car maker said. This code would then expire as soon as the boot was shut. The deliveries will be available only to customers signed up for online retail service Amazon Prime. In March, the Federal Aviation Administration, which oversees US airspace, gave Amazon permission to carry out tests using unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones, for its planned PrimeAir service.","Packages could soon be delivered to the boot of your Audi as part of a trial involving the car maker, Amazon and DHL."
"From mid-September it will introduce a real-name registration system for its Honour of Kings games, which will be linked to China's public security database. It will identify children and restrict the time they spend on the game. The move is the first of its kind in the world's largest gaming market. Tencent, which also operates the Chinese social network WeChat, posted its first profit decline since 2005 this summer, blaming the drop on tighter regulation, specifically around the approval of licences that allow companies to make money from new mobile games. Honour of Kings is a hugely popular multi-player role-playing battle game based on Chinese historical figures. It is specifically designed to play on a mobile platform, which has added to its popularity because many young gamers do not have access to a games console or PC at home. The app is free to download but players have to pay to upgrade their characters and costumes in order to advance to the next level. The game was criticised last year for its addictive nature in government-owned newspaper People's Daily, which called it ""poison"" and a ""drug"". Following the criticism, Tencent took the decision to restrict the time children could play it - with children under 12 limited to one hour a day and those between 13 and 18 to two hours. The new system will help it more accurately identify young players and ""better guide under-aged players to game sensibly"", the company said in a statement on its official WeChat account. Chinese President Xi Jinping has spoken about the need to address the problem of gaming addiction, in particular voicing concerns about how it may be affecting children's eyesight. Myopia was becoming more common among younger children, the Xinhua News Agency reported him as saying in August. Following his comments, China's Ministry of Education announced that it would curb the number of new online games available to children and take new measures to limit their time on games. Earlier this month, another Tencent game, Monster Hunter World, was banned in China, just days after going on sale. It was not clear what was behind the ban although the Chinese government has blocked dozens of games in the past, typically for featuring excessive violence, drug-taking or sex.","Chinese technology giant Tencent is introducing tough new rules to identify under-age gamers, amid a crackdown on gaming addiction in the country."
"It is the biggest single-event prize awarded at a video games event. The final in Seattle was a close-run affair. Alliance only secured victory after destroying the stronghold of runners-up, Ukraine-based Na'Vi, in the final game of a best-of-five challenge. The news comes months after the US began recognising gamers as pro athletes. The move means that highly skilled players can now apply for a P-1 work visa on the same basis as other sportsmen and sportswomen. 'Slug fest' Dota 2 is the sequel to Defense of the Ancients, a fantasy-themed battle game created by hundreds of volunteers who modified the real-time strategy game Warcraft 3. The follow-up was developed by Valve, which also hosted the tournament - the International - and put up $1.6m of the prize money. The total pot was $2.9m thanks to money raised by taking a cut of the sales of a $10 interactive pamphlet released to help fans follow the event. Sixteen five-player teams from 12 countries took part in the five-day event at Benaroya Hall. The Seattle Times reports that about 1,700 spectators attended, while an online video stream attracted as many as 600,000 simultaneous views at one point. To win, the teams had to co-ordinate in-game characters called ""heroes"" to destroy their opponents' bases while defending their own. The organisers reported that Na'Vi lost the first of the final five games after picking a ""bizarre"" draft of characters in a high-risk move that backfired. However, the next three games were closer, leading to a 2-2 score and leaving the final battle as the decider. ""In a tournament filled with great games, it was the greatest game we have ever seen,"" reported the Dota 2 blog of the final match. ""Not one single action by one team went uncountered by the other. It was a slug fest of team fights."" Alliance ultimately emerged the victor after managing to be the first to destroy their opponents' towers, allowing them to lay waste to a structure known as an ""ancient"". The Stockholm-based team were only formed this year, competing in their first Dota 2 competition in April. Since then they have built a reputation for drafting teams including characters that are often neglected by others. They have now come first in nine different Dota 2 tournaments including the G-1 Champions League in Shanghai. Gaming visa Alliance's latest achievement follows news that the US Citizenship and Immigration Services has granted a Canadian pro-gamer a visa. Danny Le became the first international e-sports player to be given the right to work and live in the US after his application was approved on May 29. Officials had previously turned him away at the border when he had tried to move to live close to his Riverside squad-mates. The team compete in tournaments for League of Legends, another battle-themed video game. The title's developer, Riot, subsequently argued that the competitions qualified as a major sports league because six or more teams competed and they generated combined revenues or more than $10m. The Los Angeles Times reported that Mr Le now planned to take part in League of Legends contests for at least five more years before returning to complete his university degree in Canada. It added that other e-sports players, including an Argentinian and an Armenian, had also been granted work visas after Mr Le's breakthrough.","A Swedish e-sports team have won $1.43m (£924,000) after emerging victorious at a Dota 2 tournament."
"In a blogpost, the search giant said it was now going to allow only extensions hosted in its online store to be added to Chrome. Before now it has been possible to add the extras via many different websites but Google said this is often how malicious extensions infect a browser. The change means older extensions added outside the store will be disabled. Extensions are a popular way for people to add extras to their browser that lets them, for instance, grab video clips, play games, use popular programs, send tweets or add utilities. Google polices extensions hosted on its Chrome store but those available via other sites are often unchecked and can be the starting point for a malware campaign, it said.

"Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent@BBCRoryCJon Twitter Apple kicked things off last night with what had been billed the iPad mini event, but turned out to be a rather larger scale ""refresh"" of the range than expected, with updated desktop and laptop computers, and a fourth version of the full-size iPad. One notable feature was that both the MacBook Pro and the new iMac came without a DVD/CD drive. Apple has decided that, in the days of pulling your content down from the cloud, physical media have had their day - whether you like it or not. There will be grumbling, but I suspect its instincts are correct. However, it was the iPad mini which was the main course, the only product that was really new - if you count becoming smaller as a real leap forward. ""There is nothing as amazing as this!"" declaimed the marketing chief Phil Schiller with typical understatement. That said, the iPad must count as one of the most groundbreaking innovations of recent years. Apple's Tim Cook boasted that 100 million had been sold in just two and a half years, and the tablet was now outselling not just every PC, but the entire range of any PC-maker. That is some shift in consumer behaviour in a short period - and as we know other companies have rushed to imitate the iPad, though with limited impact on its market share. The most successful rivals have been the 7in (17.8cm) Android tablets - in particular the Google Nexus and the Kindle Fire. They have combined decent performance with very keen pricing - but their biggest success has been in provoking Apple to change its mind. For Steve Jobs insisted that 10in (25.4cm) was the minimum size for a tablet. He was talking about the screen size necessary to display useful apps but he may have also had in mind the juicy margins Apple was getting on the bigger device. There were big dangers for the company in pricing the iPad mini - make it too cheap and it could cannibalise the lucrative sales of its big brother, too expensive and it could flop against the competition from Google and Amazon. Before we got to the price, Phil Schiller launched a pretty direct attack on a rival device. Placing a picture of the Google Nexus 7 alongside the iPad mini, he went through their specifications - the iPad's screen size was not so mini, 30% bigger than the Nexus, the overall experience on one was ""great"", on the other ""not so great"". Ah, but when we got to the price, it was clear you paid for that extra real estate. It starts at £269 for the 16GB version, compared to £199 for the Google Nexus, with Amazon's Kindle Fire HD even cheaper at £159. That looks expensive - but we mustn't underestimate the sheer power of the iPad brand. Apple says 90% of all web traffic from a tablet is from an iPad right now - and those hundred million users out there surfing on trains and in cafes are a great marketing resource for the mini. I'm sure it will sell well to people who wanted but couldn't quite afford the full-size version - the big question is whether that comes at the expense of the new fourth generation iPad. And there's more competition about to arrive. The Surface - the new tablet from Microsoft - is on sale on Friday. More on this later, but it looks quite an impressive addition to the high-end professional end of the market. And then next Monday Google holds an Android event, with talk of a 10in Nexus. Tablets, big and small, are crowding out the PC, with sales of personal computers down 8% on a year ago. In 2010 when the iPad was launched many mocked it as a plaything - but Apple, Google and even Microsoft believe the future of their industry is tablet-shaped, so getting the right offer in front of consumers is a very serious business.","In a hectic year, the tectonic plates of technology are shifting again. In the space of a few days, three giants of this industry - Apple, Microsoft and Google - are holding major product launches, and it is tablets which are centre stage."
"By Maggie ShielsTechnology reporter, BBC News, Silicon Valley A groups feature will allow users to specify circles of friends with whom they want to share different data. For the first time, users will also be able to download all the data they have uploaded onto the site. They will also find it easier to see how individual applications are using personal information, Facebook's chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said. ""The changes today are about giving people more control over how they share in a lot of different contexts,"" Mr Zuckerberg told BBC News. ""One of the things we have heard is that people just want to share information with smaller groups of people. ""It will enable people to share things that they wouldn't have wanted to share with all of their friends."" He added: ""There are some things you are comfortable saying to all your friends at once but a lot of things you only want to share with your close co-workers or your family and there just hasn't been a great way to do that until now."" Behaviour change The groups feature will allow users form online havens around a discreet circle of people just as they do in the real world. Members will then be able to share information with people specific to that group. A list feature on Facebook already lets users create subsets of their friends but Mr Zuckerberg said that only about 5% of its 500 million users use it. ""Groups will change behaviour,"" Augie Ray a senior analyst with research firm Forrester told BBC News. ""It's possible that people will join Facebook because they will feel they can control who sees their information. I am a very open person and blast everything I say on Twitter or Facebook but now something like this will allow people to think more deeply about who will see what they say, and will increase engagement."" Another analyst Ray Valdes of Gartner called groups ""a major milestone in a very long road that represents part of the ongoing evolution of our social connections"". 'False security' Facebook said its engineers had been in lockdown for the past 60 days working on these new products. One of the new tools called ""Download Your Information"" is designed to enable users to download everything they have ever posted to the site, such as photos, status updates and wall posts. The tool is a major departure for Facebook, which has come under criticism in the past for not allowing users access to their own data. This effectively locked Facebook users into the site, unable to port their data to other sites. ""All the information that is on Facebook comes from people sharing it,"" said Mr Zuckerberg. ""It is not our information. It is people's information. We just have this strong philosophical belief that people own that information and they should be able set exactly who can see it, move it to different applications and use it how they want. They should be able to take it away if they want."" The groups feature is the one the company touted most heavily and one that Mr Zuckerberg seemed most proud of. ""We think that what we have out of the box, version one, blows away everything else,"" he said, referring to ""groups"" services offered by internet stalwarts such as Yahoo! and Google. Privacy has been a constant thorn for the world's biggest social network whenever it introduces new products or changes settings on the site. ""Mostly I am happy they are giving users more control and I think the groups aspect for the most part does give you this added control,"" said Larry Magid, co-director of ConnectSafely.org. Phone sync worries ""The only worry I have is that friends can add people to the group, so if you create a group and are in a group you have to be aware of not only who you add but who others add. ""As long as you are aware of who is in the group it can be a great privacy tool. If it gets out of hand it could give you a sense of false security."" The roll out of new products comes amid reports that a syncing feature on the iPhone lets Facebook access contact data and share it on the site. ""It's very possible that your private phone numbers - and those of lots of your and their friends - are on the site,"" said Charles Arthur of the Guardian newspaper. Another tech blogger, Kurt van Moos, who was the first to warn about this feature in January, outlined his concerns. ""Phone numbers are private and valuable. Most people who have entrusted you with their phone numbers assume you will keep them private and safe,"" he said. In a statement to the BBC, Facebook confirmed that the site allowed them to sync their friends' contact information. ""The ability to sync their contacts is used for the purpose of connecting [users] with their friends,"" it said. ""All of this information is private and is not shared with any friends or any third party. ""Even if someone wanted to, they could not share any of this information with other friends, for example."" Facebook added that users could easily delete contacts copied over from their phones.",Facebook has introduced a raft of features aimed at giving users more control over their personal data.
"The drivers say they are paid below minimum wage levels required by some states and barely above national rates. For 12 hours, the drivers involved in the protests plan to turn off the Uber app and stop working for the ride-hailing firm. The protests will take place on 8 May when Uber makes its stock market debut. Cash levy ""Uber's much-anticipated IPO [initial public offering] will put millions into the pockets of executives, but the drivers who are the core of the service of the company will get nothing,"" Shona Clarkson from Gig Workers Rising, which is helping to organise the protests, told The Guardian. Gig Workers Rising is believed to have 4,000 drivers among its members. The drivers involved in the protests have four demands: Drivers would continue to be exploited if they did not get more protections, said Ms Clarkson. A letter has been delivered to Uber's headquarters detailing the drivers' demands and warning it of the shutdown. In the letter, drivers expressed fears that pay rates would be cut after the IPO as the company sought to make itself more ""palatable"" to investors. Publicly available figures suggest that Uber and Lyft drivers are paid $8.55 (£6.87) an hour in the US. This is higher than the national mandated minimum wage level of $7.25, but less than rates set by some states. In California the minimum wage rates for drivers is $11. New York now operates a city by-law that demands drivers working for Uber, and other ride-hailing firms like Lyft and Juno, must get paid at least $17.22 an hour. Gig Workers uprising is organising protests in San Francisco, Chicago, Los Angeles and San Diego. Some drivers in other cities, including Minneapolis, Philadelphia and Washington DC, are also expected to turn off the app on 8 May. A separate protest will be held outside Uber's head office in San Francisco on the same day. Uber has not yet reacted to the drivers demands nor responded to a BBC request for comment. The company has recently run a driver bonus scheme that rewards regular drivers with cash. The scheme is believed to be a way for it to get around US regulations that stop it rewarding drivers, who are not its direct employees, with shares. Drivers who clocked up more than 10,000 trips for the firm received $1,000 as a reward. However, as Uber driver Jay Cradeur pointed out in a blog, anyone who invested the cash that rival Lyft handed out to its drivers in a similar scheme could have ended up losing some of their bonus if they bought the firm's shares, because their value had dropped sharply. Update 7 May 2019: This story has been amended to make it clear who is organising protests among Uber drivers across the US.",Uber drivers in seven US cities are planning protests to highlight what they claim are poor working conditions and low wages at the ride-hailing firm.
"By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor It described its Infinity Flex Display as ""the foundation of the smartphone of tomorrow"" and said it intended to start production within months. When unfolded, the device resembles a 7.3in (18.5cm) tablet. When closed, a separate smaller ""cover display"" on the handset's other side comes into use. Samsung has teased the concept for more than five years and had been vying with Huawei to show off a device first. However, both were upstaged a week ago when little-known start-up Royole unveiled a foldable phone of its own. Unlike Royole's FlexPai, Samsung obscured the final look of its device. It placed it in a case to hold off revealing the design until a later event. It also did not disclose how it will brand the phone. However, it did reveal that the forthcoming handset would be able to run three apps at once. Justin Denison, the executive who unveiled the handset, noted that when folded up the device fitted ""neatly inside"" a jacket pocket thanks to the displays involved being thinner than those on earlier phones. Unlike the FlexPai, the two sides of Samsung's device lie flat when closed. But this comes at the cost of there being noticeable breaks in its bezel, at least on the prototype demoed. Shipments of Samsung's smartphones were 13.4% lower in the July-to-September quarter than for the same period the previous year, according to market research firm IDC. Although the sector as a whole shrank over the 12 months, the South Korean firm still underperformed, with its market share slipping from 22.1% to 20.3%. But analysts say a flexible phone has the potential to strengthen Samsung's brand and boost interest in its wider family of devices. ""We've already had squeezable, swivel, clamshell and even foldable phones,"" commented IDC's Marta Pinto. ""Differentiation is super important. Samsung's smartphone sales are declining as it faces serious competition from Huawei and other Chinese brands. ""If it can bring a new and really interesting device to the market it could be a chance to regain momentum and return to growth."" Google is also holding a developer event of its own for Android programmers. One of its engineering chiefs announced that it would soon add support to the operating system to allow other manufactures to create foldable phones of their own. It also tweeted an animation of the concept in action. Analysis: Dave Lee, North America technology reporter Finally, some interesting innovation in the smartphone space. Or smartphone and tablet space, I guess you could say. A new form factor can be a huge boost to device-makers, but only if it makes sense. A flip phone made previously big devices pocket-sized, and then smartphones brought button-less interaction to our palms. But what will foldable screens bring? One of the reasons why Samsung teased this device at its developers conference was to give software-makers a chance to think about how to make the most of the new possibilities a foldable screen might bring. There's a reason why just about every new smartphone up until today looked the same: it worked. To go foldable, there's likely to be big trade-offs on price, screen quality and perhaps weight - the device Samsung teased today did look chunky. I'll hold back on a verdict until I get a chance to hold one for myself. IBM Simon: The first mobile phone to offer a touchscreen user-interface - but its battery only lasted an hour. Siemens S10: The first handset with a colour display - although only red, green, blue and white could be shown. LG Prada: The handset debuted a capacitive touchscreen - detecting finger taps by changes in the display's electrical field rather than pressure. iPhone: Apple made use of ""multi-touch"", detecting several points of contact - allowing pinch-to-zoom and other interactions. Nokia N85: First phone with an OLED (organic light-emitting diode) display, letting it show deeper blacks and better contrast. Samsung Galaxy Note: Although not the first ""phablet"", the handset proved there was demand for a 5+ inch display, despite claims it was ""comically huge"". LG G Flex: The curved design was derided as being a gimmick, but points the way to the true ""bendy"" phones of the future. Sharp Aquos Crystal: The phone's ""edgeless"" look foreshadowed today's trend to keep bezels to a minimum. Samsung Galaxy Note Edge: Samsung's first handset to wrap its screen over one its sides used the extra space for notifications and app shortcuts. Sony Xperia Z5 Premium: The smartphone premiered a 4K display before it was easy to obtain such ultra-high definition mobile content. Essential Phone: The start-up beat Apple to featuring a camera notch in its display, which allowed the rest of the screen to extend upwards. Royole FlexPai: The California-based start-up surprised the industry when it revealed the ""world's first foldable phone"" last month.",Samsung has unveiled a folding handset at an event in San Francisco.
"EU officials had criticised the firm for favouring its own price comparison results when answering search queries. The tech giant said it would now direct users to other price comparison sites and merchants selling products. It will also make it easier for Android users to select web browsers other than Google's own Chrome browser. The changes to search mean that results from rival sites, such as TripAdvisor or Kelkoo, will become more prominent to avoid Google's own retail recommendations dominating. Last year, rivals had complained to the European Commission (EC) that search results were unfairly prioritising Google's own shopping service over others. Google made the adjustments shortly before a €1.49bn (£1.28bn) fine was handed down by European regulators on Wednesday. This was also in relation to what officials called unfair competition activities: blocking ads from rivals offering alternative web search options. Browser options Android users will find it easier to choose a different web browser on their phones and tablets thanks to the other change announced. Chrome comes pre-installed on Android devices, but users will now be asked directly if they would like to use another browser. It comes a year after the EC fined Google €4.34bn (£3.72bn) for abusing its market position and making rivals' browsers less accessible. ""Now we'll also do more to ensure that Android phone owners know about the wide choice of browsers and search engines available to download to their phones,"" Google executive Kent Walker wrote in a blog. ""This will involve asking users of existing and new Android devices in Europe which browser and search apps they would like to use."" The BBC has contacted the EC for comment.","Google has said it will make changes to how search results are displayed within the EU, in response to scrutiny it has faced over competition practices."
"The plans were presented at a council meeting on Monday by Jehn Balajadia, operations co-ordinator of the firm. She said: ""The purpose of Boring Company is to alleviate soul-destroying traffic and augment public transit."" Mr Musk, also chief of Tesla Inc and Space Exploration Technologies Corp, didn't speak at the meeting. A report by the Culver City manager's office stated: ""The Boring Company has proposed a privately funded human transportation tunnel that would run underneath the Westside of Los Angeles. ""The tunnel would contain a high-speed underground public transportation system in which passengers are transported on autonomous electric skates travelling at 125-150mph."" The electric skates will be designed to carry either single passenger vehicles or what are described as ""mass transit"" pods capable of transporting between eight and 16 people. The company says the plan would ease road congestion and allow people to move around the city more easily. Ms Balajadia stressed that the company was not looking for public funding and that the cost to passengers would be comparable to, or less than existing forms of public transit in the region. Mr Musk, who himself lives in Bel Air, is reported by Bloomberg to have first mooted the idea of a tunnel system back in December 2016, when he tweeted that he was fed up with LA traffic and would ""build a tunnel boring machine"". The proposed route is from the headquarters of Musk's company SpaceX in Hawthorne to West Los Angeles passing underneath Sepulveda Boulevard through Culver City. The plans are reported to have been well-received by some members of the council as a way of dealing with the region's traffic congestion. However, concerns were expressed by council member Meghan Sahli-Wells about a private company creating a system that may compete with existing public transport agencies in Los Angeles. ""This is really seductive,"" said Ms Sahli-Wells. ""It looks super-sexy and super-easy, but it's half-baked from a public perspective."" As reported on the BBC last July the serial entrepreneur also tweeted his interest in building a Loop transport system on the East Coast. The difference between a Loop and a Hyperloop is that the latter requires a vacuum to be created within the tubes to eliminate air friction while the former does not. When asked for further details on the claims in his tweets, a spokesperson for the firm told the BBC: ""The Boring Company has had a number of promising conversations with local, state and federal government officials. ""With a few exceptions, feedback has been very positive and we have received verbal support from key government decision-makers for tunnelling plans, including a Hyperloop route from New York to Washington DC. ""We look forward to future conversations with the cities and states along this route and we expect to secure the formal approvals necessary to break ground later this year."" Last July, the company said that it was expecting to start digging by the end of 2017.","Elon Musk's Boring Company has presented plans to build a tunnel under Culver City, California for a Hyperloop-like transport system."
"By Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent The allegations stem from a Wall Street Journal report in early October. Russian hackers had used Kaspersky software to identify classified files on the NSA contractor's home computer, which they then stole, it said. It later emerged Kaspersky had also copied files off the PC itself. But the company has now said this was not deliberate and any classified documents were destroyed. It said its researchers had been investigating malicious software created by ""the Equation Group"", which is widely understood to be Kaspersky's codeword for the NSA. And this research had included looking for signatures relating to known Equation activity on machines running the company's software. On 11 September 2014, the company said, one of its products deployed on a home computer with an internet protocol (IP) address in Baltimore, Maryland - close to where the NSA is based - had reported what appeared to be variants of the malware used by the Equation Group. Soon after, the user had disabled the Kaspersky Lab anti-virus tool and downloaded and installed pirated software infected with another, separate form of malware. And when the Kaspersky product had been re-activated, it had also detected this malware and new variants of Equation malware inside a 7zip archive - a file containing compressed documents. This had been sent back to Kaspersky Lab and found to contain known and unknown Equation tools, source code and classified documents, indicating the user of the computer had been not a victim of Equation but one of its authors. Eugene Kaspersky, the company's founder and chief executive, had then ordered the classified data should be deleted from the company's systems, and within days it had been. Kaspersky had kept only the malware ""binaries"", computer code necessary to improve protection for its customers. ""According to security software industry standards, requesting a copy of an archive containing malware is a legitimate request,"" the firm said. ""We also found no indication the information ever left our corporate networks."" The Wall Street Journal report had said the Russian government had secretly scanned computers using Kaspersky software to spy on the US government - not necessarily with the company's knowledge. Israeli intelligence Kaspersky denies creating ""signatures"" specifically designed to search for top secret or classified material. And it has now said the only third-party intrusion in its networks was by Duqu 2.0 - malware linked to Israeli intelligence. Following the Wall Street Journal report, the New York Times had reported that Israel had penetrated Kaspersky's networks in 2014 and alerted the US to the possibility of Kaspersky software being used for espionage. Kaspersky has also said the separate form of malware not linked to the Equation Group that it had detected on the Maryland PC, had been Smoke Bot or Smoke Loader, a Trojan created by a Russian hacker in 2012 and sold on Russian underground forums. Prime target And during this period the command-and-control servers of this malware were registered to what appeared to be a Chinese entity. ""Given that system owner's potential clearance level, the user could have been a prime target of nation states,"" the Kaspersky spokesman said. US federal agencies have now been told to remove all Kaspersky software from their computers. The Kaspersky spokesman said: ""Kaspersky Lab security software, like all other similar solutions from our competitors, has privileged access to computer systems to be able to resist serious malware infections and return control of the infected system back to the user,"" the company says in its statement. ""This level of access allows our software to see any file on the systems that we protect. With great access comes great responsibility.""",The Russian-headquartered anti-virus company Kaspersky Lab has hit back at reports it deliberately extracted sensitive files from a US National Security Agency worker's computer.
"By BBC MonitoringAnalysis IS and other jihadist groups have been exploiting new functionality introduced by the app in late September, which allows users to broadcast their messages to an unlimited number of members via their own Telegram ""channel"". In an announcement on Wednesday evening, the Berlin-based Telegram said it had shut down 78 IS channels and promised to make it easier for users to flag ""objectionable public content"" shared via the app. ""We were disturbed to learn that Telegram's public channels were being used by ISIS [alternative name for IS] to spread their propaganda,"" said a statement from Telegram, which was set up in 2013 by two Russian brothers, Pavel and Nikolai Durov. Paris attacks The action followed claims by IS for the 13 November Paris attacks and the downing of a Russian passenger jet over Egypt's Sinai Peninsula on 31 October. Shortly before the key IS propaganda channel on Telegram was shut down on 18 November, it had been used to publish IS's English-language magazine Dabiq which hailed the Paris attacks and featured an image of the bomb IS claims to have used to bring down the plane. IS had shifted its propaganda distribution to Telegram from Twitter on 26 September, just four days after Telegram trumpeted the launch of its new ""Channels"" tool. An official IS channel dubbed Nashir, which translates as ""Distributor"" in English, quickly became the platform where IS propaganda started appearing first, often several minutes before being posted to Twitter - IS's other favoured outlet. The channel had amassed over 16,000 subscribers before it was shut down along with a raft of other IS channels used to distribute the group's propaganda in a wide range of languages, including English, French, Russian, Turkish and Urdu. But many other jihadist Telegram channels continue to be active, including official channels operated by al-Qaeda's branches in Yemen and North Africa and others supportive of IS. And the clampdown by Telegram has not stopped IS getting its message out, with the group reverting to its network of accounts on Twitter to publish its latest material. Since July 2014, when IS's last official branded accounts were suspended by Twitter, the group's media operatives have been caught up in a cat-and-mouse game with the site administration, which routinely suspends IS's quasi-official, non-branded accounts. IS's hopes that Telegram would offer it a more stable and resilient platform for its propaganda appear to have been dashed. ""Secret chat"" But Telegram has indicated that it does not intend to act against terrorists' use of the app's private messaging service, saying it would only move to suppress illegal ""publicly available"" material. ""All Telegram chats and group chats are private amongst their participants. We do not process any requests related to them,"" the company says on its website. Even before IS launched its latest propaganda channel via Telegram, there had been evidence that the group and its members were using the app's private messaging facility. In September, IS had advertised an Iraqi mobile phone number, which people could use to get in touch with the group via Telegram in order to pay a ransom for two hostages being held by the group. And jihadists inspired by IS, including a British teenager convicted recently, have used the app's secure encrypted messaging to conduct attack planning. Jihadists have been drawn by Telegram's boast to provide a ""secret chat"" facility, which heavily encrypts messages user-to-user with a unique key to avoid interception by hackers or government agencies. Telegram is so confident of its security that it twice offered a reward of hundreds of thousands of dollars to the first person who could crack its encryption.

Video battle Owners of Amazon's Fire tablet who are also signed up to the Prime service have been able to download movies and programmes for months. An updated Amazon Video app now extends this to non-Amazon branded gadgets. Amazon is the first net-based video subscription service to offer the downloading option on Android and iOS devices. Licensing restrictions will mean some content will be available only for streaming rather than downloading. In a statement, Amazon said its own video series were all available offline and added a list of many other popular programmes, including 24, Downton Abbey, Hannibal and Vikings, that were also available. Rik Henderson, senior editor at tech news site Pocket-lint, said offline viewing was ""nigh-on essential"" given modern media viewing habits.

"By Daniel ThomasBusiness reporter But the internet media company's fortunes have changed drastically, with sales falling from $7.2bn (£5bn) in 2008 to $4.6bn (£3.1bn) last year. This is partly because Google and Facebook have come to dominate the online advertising market from where Yahoo derives its revenue. A series of chief executives has also failed to stem the decline. This week, Reuters reported investors had called for Yahoo's core business to be sold after a slump in its share price. Some said it could lead to the sacking of current chief executive Marissa Mayer and even the end of the Yahoo brand itself. So where did it all go wrong for the firm and what lies ahead? Inauspicious beginnings? Dark clouds haven't always surrounded Yahoo. Founded in 1994 by Stanford University graduates Jerry Yang and David Filo, the firm swiftly grew to become one of the internet's first web portals, competing with the likes of MSN and Lycos. ""It was a one-stop shop bringing together news and other services for users lacking expertise in navigating the internet,"" said Richard Kramer, founder of Arete Research and a 20-year tech analyst. The company also survived the dot com crash of 2000 and its sales climbed tenfold between 2001 and 2008. However, Mr Kramer said that over time the concept of web portals had become ""outmoded"". ""In its main search and display ad businesses, Yahoo found itself being overtaken by rivals like Gmail and Hotmail or younger upstarts, messaging apps like Whatsapp or WeChat,"" he said. ""News aggregation came from Facebook, Twitter and new digital channels like Huffington Post or Vice."" He added: ""Yahoo also fell behind the curve in search - partnering with Microsoft, which had tried to buy it - while it was slow to scale up in video and mobile."" Left behind? The problem was Yahoo generated most of its revenue by selling advertising space on such platforms - and as its audience drifted to other sites, its sales faltered. Highlighting the discord, chief executive Mr Yang stepped down in December 2008 and the firm laid off 7% of its workforce a month later. The company needed to reinvent itself - but even Mr Yang's replacement, Carole Bartz, admitted she had struggled with the question of what Yahoo is when she took over in 2009. ""We're not a search company. We're not a display [advertising] company. We're a broad-based internet technology company that serves up the most interesting content on the internet to 600 million people,"" she later said. Mr Kramer said the high level of the churn at the top at the firm did not help either. Ms Bartz soon lost her job in September 2011 and her replacement, Scott Thompson, only lasted four months before resigning over claims he falsified his resumé. ""They went through an endless succession of management changes at a time when they really needed to steady the ship,"" Mr Kramer said. ""They were also besieged by activist investors calling for change, continuing the cycle of management churn."" What next? Ms Mayer, who has been in situ since July 2012, now faces a similar revolt. She has tried to bolster Yahoo by acquiring firms such as Flurry, a mobile analytics service, and Tumblr, the blogging service. But its core internet business continues to lose money. In fact, most of the internet company's $33bn (£21.8bn) value is attributed to its shareholding in Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant. After reversing a plan to sell the stake, Ms Mayer has adopted a strategy to spin off the core business into a new company But on Monday, Reuters reported several major Yahoo shareholders wanted Ms Mayer to sell the core business outright. A source said she had the support of her board, but multiple investors have called for her resignation. Mr Kramer says the choice is a simple one: ""Either the CEO needs to put herself out of a job by selling the business, or be given room to pursue a fresh strategy, with restructuring already promised to be announced with the 2015 results."" He added: ""The media likes to say Yahoo is a turnaround, but that's the wrong way to think about it. ""It really needs to grow - or buy - entirely new businesses to bolt on to its existing franchise, to attract new audiences. ""This is what Mayer is a trying to do, even if the execution of the plans has been poor.""","During the 90s and early 2000s, Yahoo was a veritable web titan - a leader in email, online news and search."
"Within minutes of making the game free online the swell of demand caused the site to slow and send error messages. Epic blamed the slowdown on ""heavy traffic"" and said it was working to fix the problem. Grand Theft Auto, known as GTA to fans, is made by Rockstar Games and is one of the top selling gaming franchises. Every week Epic Games makes a 'mystery game' available without charge on its store. The games are available for PCs or Macs. Users who download the week's mystery game can keep it forever, even when the free to download period expires. On Wednesday it was announced Grand Theft Auto V would be this week's game. The game became available at 11:00 EDT (15:00 GMT). Within minutes of the launch users began to report slowdowns and error messages. On Twitter, the company tried to calm fans. Epic Games attributed the slowdown to high demand. Grand Theft Auto V has earned more than any other single game ever released, according to MarketWatch. More than 100 million copies have been sold since its release in 2013. The slowdown and crashes appear to have lasted several hours and caused problems on other Epic platforms as well. Fortnite, which is made by Epic, appeared to be having trouble with its launcher and the mobile game Battle Breakers was also exercising issues.

"Dave LeeNorth America technology reporter The social network said it now would not remove accounts until it had a process for ""memorialising"" dead users on the network. It admitted not having a policy in place was a ""miss on our part”. The firm said it was taking action on inactive accounts due to regulatory concerns. It said once it had a full process in place, account deactivations would occur in the EU first. This was in order, Twitter said, to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). ""We apologise for the confusion and will keep you all posted,"" the company said in a series of tweets posted on Wednesday. On Monday Twitter had begun contacting users who hadn't logged in in the past six months, warning them that they would have their accounts deleted unless they signed in and agreed to the firm's latest privacy policy. After reporting from the BBC and others, the company admitted it had not considered the issue of the potential upset that would be caused by the removal of accounts belonging to users who had died. Writing on TechCrunch, Drew Olanoff, a communications officer at investment firm Scaleworks, said his ""heart sank"" when he learned of Twitter's plans, as he often checked in on his father's account, several years after his death. ""It’s my way, odd or not, of remembering him. Keeping his spirit alive. His tweets are timestamped moments that he shared with the world,"" Mr Olanoff wrote. ""And Twitter is sweeping them up like crumpled-up paper and junk in a dustbin.” Other networks, such as Facebook, offer a process called ""memorialisation"", whereby verified family members or other loved ones can request a deceased user's account is kept on the network, but frozen in time. Interactions with the account are limited in order to help prevent trolling and other abuse. Twitter said it would create such a tool. It added: ""Beyond complying with GDPR, we may broaden the enforcement of our inactivity policy in the future to comply with other regulations around the world and to ensure the integrity of the service.

"Tor is an anonymous web browser, used by those wishing to access the dark web and avoid government surveillance. It is very popular in Russia. The hackers stole some 7.5 terabytes of data from SyTech, a contractor for Russia's Federal Security Service FSB, and included details of its projects. It is not clear how successful the attempt to crack the anonymous browser was, as the method relied heavily on luck to match Tor users to their activity. Hackers from a group known as 0v1ru$ gained access to the company on 13 July, and replaced its internet homepage with a smug smiley face often used by internet trolls. The information was shared with other hackers and journalists. How did they plan to crack Tor? To crack Tor, SyTech came up with Nautilus-S, which involved actively taking part in Tor and being part of the network. When a user connects to Tor, internet service providers are able to see that Tor is being used. This data can be demanded by the FSB, and other state authorities in other countries. However, the ISPs do not know what sites are being visited through the system - just that it is being used. But the Tor network is run by volunteers and enthusiasts - and SyTech set up a ""contribution"" to the network known as an exit node - the last computer the signal passes through before reaching the website. If a user, by chance, happens to exit the network through SyTech's node, the contractor will know which website is being visited, but not who the visitor is. There are two potential risks: combining the ISP data of who is using the network with which sites are visited at what times could, theoretically, help to identify someone – if they are lucky and the person randomly exits the network through their node. But SyTech could also carry out a so-called ""man in the middle"" attack, and replace the webpage the user thought they were visiting with something else. The system of attack is not unheard of - a 2014 research paper from Karlstad University academics highlighted the use of ""malicious exit relays"". But a spokesperson for the Tor project disputed how viable SyTech's attempt to crack Tor would be. ""Although malicious exit nodes could see a fraction of the traffic exiting the network, by design, this would not be enough to deanonymise Tor users,"" they said. ""Large-scale effective traffic correlation would take a much larger view of the network, and we don't see that happening here."" What were the other projects? The attempt to crack the most widely-used anonymous browser was just one of the projects unveiled by the hack. Others included: Nautilus: Another version of Nautilus, without the ""-S"", was designed to collect information about social media users Reward: An attempt to find a flaw in the BitTorrent person-to-person system used by millions to download and share illegal copies of movies, TV shows and games Mentor: Designed to search email servers of major companies Hope / Tax-3: Projects which deal with how Russia's internet connects to and interacts with the outside network - and how to keep sensitive information safe There were at least 20 ""non-public"" projects contained in the data from the hack, most of which were apparently commissioned by a military unit linked to the FSB. Russia recently broke its record for connections to the Tor browser network, topping 600,000 users on 11 July. BBC Russian reports (in Russian) that there had been just 300,000 users at the start of the year - but the record number has been broken five times since then. The average number of daily users from Russia in the last three months has been more than 400,000.","Hackers who breached a Russian intelligence contractor found that it had been trying to crack the Tor browser and been working on other secret projects, the BBC has learned."
"The decision to halt sales came from HP and Google after owners complained about broken chargers. The two companies have also issued advice to existing owners telling them not to use the charger that came in the box with the computer. Instead, they said, owners should use third-party chargers to keep the gadget going. US reports suggest the machines have been taken off shelves at retailer Best Buy and the gadget can no longer be found in the Google, HP and Amazon online stores. In a joint statement, Google and HP said they had received a ""small number"" of reports from users saying their original charger had been damaged by overheating. The companies said they were now looking into the problem to see what was making the chargers overheat. They apologised to customers for the inconvenience caused by the faulty chargers and added that more information would follow shortly. The statement said that micro-USB chargers that work with other tablets and smartphones should be used instead of the bundled charger. Technology news site Ars Technica noted that this advice would mean that Chromebooks took much longer to charge than they would with the original charger. HP's Chromebook 11 was released in early October 2013 and cost about £230 in the UK.",All HP Chromebook 11 laptops have been removed from sale following reports the devices' chargers had been overheating.
"The world's fourth largest phone marker shipped 71 million devices in 2015 - up from 6.6 million in 2012. But it experienced weaker demand in the past 12 months, with third-quarter sales down 27%, according to analysts. Experts say Chinese phone makers are struggling in an increasingly competitive global market. In an open letter to staff, Xiaomi's chief executive Lei Jun said: ""In the first few years, we pushed ahead too fast. ""We created a miracle, but also drew on some long-term growth. ""So we have to slow down, further improve in some areas and ensure sustainable growth for a long-term future."" 'No profit' Since launching its first phone in 2011, Xiaomi has expanded rapidly, with sales surging to 57.6 million by 2014, according to market trackers IDC. But the privately-held firm only sold 39 million phones in the first nine months of 2016, and its full-year sales are unlikely to match 2015's. The firm, which also sells appliances and runs retail stores, admitted in November it still made no profit from its phones. Francisco Jeronimo, a research director at IDC, told the BBC: ""Chinese phone makers are all facing the same problems. ""The overall smartphone market globally is very tough and not growing, so what they need to do is attract clients away from other brands. ""But they are not that well known, especially outside China, which makes it hard to compete against the likes of Apple and Samsung."" It comes after rival Chinese smartphone business, LeEco, also claimed it had grown too quickly in November. In a letter to his staff, founder Jia Yueting said the company was consequently facing cash-flow problems and difficulty raising funds. Patents Despite Xiaomi's challenges, Mr Jun said he was optimistic about the future. In his letter he claimed the firm's Indian sales hit $1bn (£816m) for the first time in 2016, while sales of its smart appliances reached $2.2bn (£1.8bn). He also said Xiaomi had applied for more than 16,000 patents around the world, of which 3,612 had been granted. ""Only by constant innovation will we be able to introduce breakthrough products in the intensely competitive high-end smartphone market,"" he said.","Chinese mobile phone giant Xiaomi has said it will not disclose how many handsets it sold in 2016 after claiming it had grown ""too fast""."
"By Zoe KleinmanTechnology reporter, BBC News The Secutablet is ""based on"" the Samsung Galaxy 10.5 and runs on Samsung hardware, the firm said. The additional security it offers is aimed at businesses and governments, but less vigorously protected social media and video platforms can also be used on the device, Secusmart added. The tablet is likely to be priced at $2,380 (£1,609), according to reports. The Secutablet is compatible with Blackberry 10 and is currently undergoing security certification at the German Federal Office for Information Security. It incorporates IBM's ""app wrapping"" technology which adds extra layers of security to sensitive data. ""Security is ingrained in every part of Blackberry's portfolio, which includes voice and data encryption solutions,"" said Dr Hans-Christoph Quelle, CEO of Secusmart GmbH, a Blackberry company. ""Subject to certification of the Secutablet, German government agencies will have a new way to access Blackberry's most secure and complete communications network in the world."" Blackberry has struggled in the tablet market, and its PlayBook device did not hit sales targets when it was launched in 2010. It acquired German voice and data encryption firm Secusmart, in December 2014, and the Secutablet was unveiled at tech fair CeBit in Hanover at the weekend. ""Historically Blackberry has been strong in Germany because of its high-end security offerings,"" said analyst Nick McQuire, vice-president of enterprise at analyst CCS Insight. 'Very specific' ""Clearly the Secutablet is designed to play into Blackberry's core focus of high grade security. ""The price point is quite expensive - part of the target base is going to be people who can afford to deploy a tablet at that price,"" Mr McQuire added. ""It's aimed at businesses and sectors where security is paramount. Let's not fool ourselves, this is a very limited solution for a very specific area of the marketplace."" There has also been speculation that the device will be Android-powered because of the Samsung hardware. Android speculation ""It is highly likely - but not confirmed - that it will run on Android given that Samsung is a partner, and given Blackberry's focus on becoming more of a cross-platform security company,"" Mr McQuire said. ""One of the things they will want to be known for is to be a mobile security company. Even in the Secusmart business, you can't be entirely platform specific. ""You want to be as secure as you possibly can but you also want to be user friendly."" The Secutablet might face competition from the likes of privacy platform Silent Circle, which unveiled the next generation of its security-focused smartphone Blackphone 2 at Mobile World Congress in March, Mr McQuire said.",Blackberry-owned company Secusmart has unveiled a new tablet in collaboration with Samsung and IBM.
"In December 2018, owner BT said it would take just two years to remove Huawei equipment from its core network. But it now says ""100% of core mobile traffic"" will be on its new Ericsson-built equipment by 2023, the government deadline announced in January 2020. And it blames the government for also ruling 65% of the network's periphery must be rid of Huawei equipment too. What is the 5G core and why is it important? A mobile phone network's core is sometimes likened to its heart or brain. It is where voice and other data is routed across various sub-networks and computer servers to ensure it reaches its destination. Meanwhile, the network's periphery, its radio access network, includes the base stations and antennas that link individual mobile devices to the core. Read more ""In order to hit these ambitious targets within the timescales laid down by government and to align with their focus on 5G networks, it is now our intention to prioritise migrating our 5G customers to the new Ericsson core, followed by our 4G customers,"" a spokesman said. Meanwhile, the United States continues to pressure officials to ban Huawei outright and dozens of Conservative MPs went against their own party last month in an attempt to do so. Former International Trade and Defence Secretary Liam Fox MP was one of them. Reacting to the delay in removing Huawei from BT's core network, he said: ""Recent events have shown how necessary it is to disentangle China from UK security infrastructure. Any delay will meet with great resistance."" On Tuesday, it was announced former BT chairman Sir Michael Rake had joined Huawei's UK board. He has defended Huawei in recent months, saying further restrictions could damage the UK's relationship with China. Huawei itself has said disrupting its involvement in the rollout of 5G would do Britain ""a disservice"".",Huawei's involvement in the most sensitive parts of EE's mobile network is to continue longer than planned.
"It comes months after its users highlighted potential problems with the algorithm, which cropped large photos. The social network's follow-up research has now confirmed the problem. Twitter said it has already started phasing out the older system, with an update to mobile apps that gave more accurate image previews. Under the old system, the algorithm would do its best to centre the view of very tall or wide images in a way that would frame people's faces or other interesting parts of the image. But it did not always work perfectly. Racial bias In September last year, a university employee noticed that when he posted two photos - one of himself and one of a colleague - Twitter's preview consistently showed the white man over the black man, no matter which photo was added to the tweet first. Other users discovered the pattern held true for images of former US President Barack Obama and Senator Mitch McConnnell, or for stock images of businessmen of difference racial backgrounds. When both were in the same image, the preview crop appeared to favour white faces, hiding the black faces until users clicked through to the full photo. Twitter reacted quickly, explaining that it had tested for these kinds of problems with its machine learning system before releasing it - but acknowledged that more work had to be done, and promised a fix. The company revealed the results in a detailed engineering blog post on Wednesday. The problem was with its ""saliency algorithm"" which it released in 2018 to crop images. The algorithm was ""trained on human eye-tracking data"", Twitter explained, but the cause of the apparent issues may be down to several complicated factors. In testing, compared to a 50-50 chance of ""demographic parity"", it found: The team also tested for allegations of the ""male gaze"" effect - where images of women were cropped to the chest or legs rather than a face. But in that instance, the test they ran did not find evidence of bias. ""We considered the trade-offs between the speed and consistency of automated cropping with the potential risks we saw in this research,"" wrote Rumman Chowdhury, Twitter's director of software engineering. ""One of our conclusions is that not everything on Twitter is a good candidate for an algorithm, and in this case, how to crop an image is a decision best made by people,"" she said. She pointed to the recent rollout of a true-to-life crop preview, which also no longer crops ""standard"" 16:9 or 4:3 aspect ratio photos. ""We're working on further improvements to media on Twitter that builds on this initial effort, and we hope to roll it out to everyone soon,"" she said. In a statement to CNN, a Twitter spokesperson clarified that while the initial change was on mobile apps - where the problem was first reported - the company plans to remove the algorithmic cropping from the website version of Twitter in the coming months.","Twitter's automatic cropping of images had underlying issues that favoured white individuals over black people, and women over men, the company said."
"It means Blackberry users will have to use the mobile version of the website to log on to the social network. It is not clear when this will come into effect. Earlier this month WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook, also announced that it would only continue to support Blackberry's Android-powered Priv handset. Whatsapp support for Blackberry's own operating system will end at the end of 2016, the firm said. ""We fought back to work with WhatsApp and Facebook to change their minds, but at this time, their decision stands,"" wrote Lou Gazzola, who works in developer relations at Blackberry, in a blog post. ""We have worked hard to ensure our end users have the best experience in light of this decision, and are continuing to search for alternate solutions."" Mr Gazzola urged supporters to take to social media using the hashtag #ILoveBB10Apps. ""Hey @facebook and @WhatsApp #ILoveBB10Apps Please don't kill'em *attempts puppy eyes*"" tweeted Jo.

"A petition to save the service, which aggregates news content from web feeds, had 25,000 signatures in a few hours. Experts say shutting Reader is part of Google's plan to migrate more people to its social media service, Google+. Google said in its official blog: ""There are two simple reasons for this - usage of Google Reader has declined, and as a company we are pouring all of our energy into fewer products."" It added users and developers who wanted to use alternatives could export their data, including their subscriptions over the next four months, using its Google Takeout service. Google Reader launched in 2005, when Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feeds were a new way to keep tabs on favourite websites and blogs. The news of its demise has led to a debate about the service on Twitter. Some said its launch had effectively destroyed other RSS competitors. Security consultant @cortesi tweeted: ""Google - a destroyer of ecosystems"". In his blog, he added:"" ""Google destroyed the RSS feed-reader ecosystem with a subsidised product, stifling its competitors and killing innovation. ""It then neglected Google Reader itself for years, after it had effectively become the only player."" Adam Leach, a principal analyst at research firm Ovum, said Google's business model was to offer free services in order to draw people into its other offerings. Now, he said, Google wanted people to experience their favourite websites in a more social way and was seeking to migrate its aggregation platforms to its social media service. ""This has been on the cards for a while. It is part of Google's strategy to shift people to Google + and other social tools,"" he said. Doomed to fail He added he would personally miss the service. ""I use Google Reader every day,"" he said. ""It is one of those tools that sits in the background and allows you to keep pace with what is going on."" But Chris Wetherell, one of Reader's chief engineers, told tech news site GigaOm it had been ""doomed to fail from the very beginning because Google ""never really believed in the project"".","Google is to shut down its Reader service in July, as usage has declined."
"A group that affiliated itself to the loose collective known as Anonymous said it would target official websites. There have been major protests in Brazil against what some have said is an overly extravagant outlay. The Brazilian Army admitted it could not provide complete protection, but insisted it would respond to the most likely threats. ""We are already making plans... I don't think there is much they can do to stop us,"" one activist - who went by the alias Eduarda Dioratto - told the Reuters press agency. The activists reportedly said that the World Cup offered an unprecedented global audience and an opportune moment to target sites operated by world football's governing body Fifa, the Brazilian government and corporate sponsors. 'Fast and damaging' ""The attacks will be directed against official websites and those of companies sponsoring the cup,"" an activist known as Che Commodore said. He added that the most likely tactics would be to launch distributed denial of service attacks, which flood target websites with traffic and cause them to crash. ""It's fast, damaging and relatively simple to carry out,"" Che Commodore told Reuters. He said his colleagues' fire would not be turned on ordinary Brazilians, however. And, despite the government's preparations, the activists said they were confident of success. ""It's nothing out of this world"", said one called Bile Day. ""Security remains very low."" Reuters said it was unable to independently verify the true identities of the people it had contacted online. The tournament is expected to cost about 33bn Brazilian real (£8.4bn), and the level of expenditure has highlighted the inequalities present in Brazil. Kicks off A series of protests during last year's Confederations Cup - seen as a warm-up for this summer's main event - drew more than a million people on to the streets. Brazil's race to get its stadiums ready for the tournament, which kicks off on 12 June, has dominated the headlines so far. But experts agreed that little attention was being paid to the country's telecommunications infrastructure, Reuters reported. The country suffers from overstrained networks, widespread use of pirated software and low investment in online security, as well as a sophisticated domestic cyber-criminal community, which is already disrupting ticket sales and other World Cup commerce. ""It's not a question of whether the cup will be targeted, but when,"" said William Beer, a cyber-security expert with the consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. ""So resilience and response become extremely important."" General Jose Carlos dos Santos, the head of the cyber-command for Brazil's army, said: ""It would be reckless for any nation to say it's 100% prepared for a threat. ""But Brazil is prepared to respond to the most likely cyber-threats."" A Fifa spokesman declined to comment on online security.","Brazilian online activists are threatening to disrupt the 2014 Fifa World Cup, it has been reported."
"Letters sent by seven technology companies to US senators reveal that US authorities found out about the flaws only through the media. Details were first leaked to technology news site The Register on 2 January. The flaws were discovered by Google Project Zero's security researchers. In response to questions posed by Republican congressman Greg Walden, who chairs the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Google owner Alphabet said it had informed Intel, AMD and ARM about the chip flaws in June 2017. The three semiconductor manufacturers were given 90 days to fix the flaws before disclosing the bugs to the public. Alphabet said it had left it up to the companies to decide whether they should inform government officials about the security flaws, as per standard practice. Intel declined to comment. However, the company's letter to Mr Walden offers more details about what happened. It says that Google Project Zero chose to extend the 90-day timeframe to 9 January 2018, and that Intel had to agree to keep the information confidential until that date. Intel maintains that there is no indication that Spectre or Meltdown were ever exploited, and that it followed the responsible disclosure policies set out by the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team.","Computer-chip-maker Intel did not inform US cyber-security officials about the Spectre and Meltdown security flaws before details leaked to the press, it has been revealed."
"It follows the failure of the NHS app in England, which was trialled on the Isle of Wight. The NI app will be based on the Google/Apple model. It is designed to be compatible with an app due to be released soon in the Republic of Ireland. That app is also based on the toolkit provided by Apple and Google. The Apple and Google model is more privacy-focused, but provides less data to epidemiologists than the centralised version that England was trialling. ""The Health Minister has commissioned work to develop a proximity app, based on the de-centralised Google/ Apple model, for use in Northern Ireland,"" said the Northern Ireland Department of Health in a statement. ""This work includes examining the interoperability of apps and the sharing of information across the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic,"" it said. It added that the Information Commissioner, Equality Commission and NI Human Rights Commission were all involved in exploring ""statutory information governance, equality and human rights issues"", and that their assessments would be published. If Northern Ireland does manage to release a functioning contact tracing app within weeks that will be a major embarrassment to the UK government. After all, in England an NHS team managed to spend four months and nearly £12m ($15m) developing a centralised app that did not work. The Health Secretary Matt Hancock then announced that the new focus would be on a decentralised app using the Google Apple toolkit - but that was unlikely to be ready for months. Then this week the prime minister assured the House of Commons that no country in the world had a working contact tracing app. Yet Northern Ireland's health minister seems confident that a few weeks work, perhaps building on the experience of Germany and other countries which have released decentralised apps, can deliver something that will do the job and even be compatible with the Irish Republic's project. The NHS X team had always hoped its app would be rolled out across the UK - now perhaps it's Northern Ireland which will provide a high tech contact tracing solution that all four home nations can use.","Northern Ireland is planning to release its own coronavirus contact-tracing app within weeks, the BBC has learned."
"It comes nearly two years after one of Uber's self-driving cars was involved in a fatal crash in Arizona. Uber scaled back its autonomous car operations following the incident. Receiving a permit in California - which has granted permits to 65 other transport firms - is the latest step in Uber's revival of the programme. California allows companies to test self-driving technology with a backup driver in the car. Before the fatal crash, Uber's self-driving cars were being tested in four locations in North America - Phoenix, Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Toronto. 'A critical step' Uber said it is considering using San Francisco, where the company is based, again. It did not give a timeline for when it will resume testing. ""We do not have an update as to exactly when we'll resume autonomous testing,"" the company said in a statement. It added: ""Receiving our testing permit through the California Department of Motor Vehicles is a critical step towards that end in Uber's home city"". California has granted permits to 66 companies in total to test autonomous vehicles, but Uber is the only one that has been involved in a fatal crash. Uber stopped its testing on public roads following a crash in March 2018 that took the life of Elaine Herzberg, aged 49. Ms Herzberg was crossing a poorly lit stretch of a multi-lane road with her bicycle in Arizona when she was struck by a Volvo XC90 using Uber's self-driving technology. An investigation into the crash found the car's backup driver, Rafaela Vasquez, had taken her eyes off the road moments before. Records also showed that she was streaming a television show on her phone during that time. In 2019, prosecutors ruled that Uber was not criminally liable for the crash. An earlier police report said the incident was ""entirely avoidable"". Uber said its self-driving programme ""underwent an overhaul"" following the incident. Uber's self-driving operations resumed in Pittsburgh in 2018. The company also plans to begin testing in Washington DC later this year. Self-driving technology is seen as crucial for Uber's efforts to eventually turn a profit. Uber has lost $7.4bn (£5.7bn) since it went public in May 2019. It will report its latest quarterly results on Thursday.",Ride-hailing firm Uber has been issued a permit by the Department of Motor Vehicles in California to test self-driving cars on public roads.
"By Alex HudsonBBC News Do these recent events prove the internet fuels intolerance against homosexuals and bisexuals, or is it the key to gay pride and the catalyst for equal rights? ""It was my first love. It changed my life,"" wrote hip-hop artist Frank Ocean on his blog a fortnight ago. It was the first time he had stated in public that he had had feelings for another man. Before long websites had been created with titles including ""Hate tweets to Frank Ocean"" gathering together responses culled from public posts. While some messages were supportive, many included threats using language that gay communities have cited as homophobic - pledging not to listen to his music and promising to stop following him on social media until he ""stopped being gay"". The ill will followed another controversy sparked by Kraft Foods on Facebook. The US snacks maker had pledged its support for gay pride just over a week earlier with a picture of a cookie with a rainbow-coloured filling on its Oreo marketing page. The post attracted more than 20,000 comments. Many applauded the firm but some swore that they would never buy the biscuit again, that Oreo had no business talking about sexuality and that its effort was ""disgusting"". 'Double standards' Homophobic sentiment is simple to find on the web. Public messages have threatened to put children up for adoption if they were homosexual, discussed teaching a son to ""beat up gays"" and claimed that homosexuality is ""a disease that will kill you"". For a young person struggling to come to terms with his or her sexuality, the gay community thinks that this sort of language, whatever its intent, causes a great deal of harm. ""[The use of the word gay] is the one thing that hasn't changed,"" says Ruth Hunt, director of public affairs at gay equality charity Stonewall. ""98% of young people still hear 'that's so gay, you're so gay'. ""What they tell us is that if they grow up thinking that gay is rubbish, then they realise they are gay, it doesn't make them feel better to know that this word is used and they see double standards."" Some feel it remains too easy for people to post anonymous comments, knowing that efforts will only be made to identify them under the most extreme circumstances. ""It is unlikely the new law will be used frequently,"" Jessica Geen, of Pink News, wrote in 2010 about the introduction of a criminal offence in England and Wales outlawing incitement to hatred on the grounds of sexual orientation. ""Similar laws against inciting racial hatred have only been used around 20 times in the 30 years since they came into force."" Grindr capital But while the net provides a forum for prejudicial comments it also offers an opportunity to combat them and enjoy a homosexual or bisexual lifestyle. Kraft noted after its Oreo Pride campaign that ""positive comments have far outnumbered any negative comments"". Search firm Google also recently organised a Legalise Love Conference , while about 400 Facebook staff took part in a San Francisco Pride march. ""Homosexuality is a lot more free than it was 10 years ago,"" says Joel Simkhai, founder of Grindr, a mobile app targeted at gay men, and a homosexual himself. ""The web has been helpful with that."" Grindr is an app that shows photos and information about members in the vicinity of the user, providing a tool to assist meet-ups. London, the company says, has become the app's capital of the world, with 350,000 users. Globally, it says it has over four million members, a quarter of whom are active every day. ""I don't know where I would be if I didn't have the web,"" says Mr Simkhai. ""Maybe I would be 'closeted' longer, maybe I would be married with a woman, there are millions of men that have married women because they couldn't come out. ""For me, the web was so helpful to that process. It empowered me to say 'I'm not different', that's what the web gave me. I suspect it gives that to a lot of people."" No escape? But despite talk of progress some charities remain concerned. ""What young people tell us is that they can't escape on the web,"" says Stonewall's Ms Hunt. ""You get home, you log in and you're trying to do your geography homework and someone's calling you a poof and that's hard. ""It's the fact that there's no respite that's the problem."" A sizeable minority, 23% of homosexuals being bullied have attempted to commit suicide, according to Stonewall's figures. That compares to 7% of the heterosexual community. The internet is easy to use to attack people, something that is often referred to as trolling, whereas finding help online can prove tricky. ""One of the big problems about gay information is that it does not get through firewalls,"" adds Ms Hunt. ""Schools and hospitals block the words 'gay' and 'lesbian'. ""We really want to provide something they can access at school, can access on their smartphone, to counteract all the stuff that's out there that's negative.""",Oreo cookies spark anti-gay online comments and are followed by a homophobic backlash against a rising New Orleans-based star.
"Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent@BBCRoryCJon Twitter When I spoke to the company's CEO Olaf Swantee last October, he was confident about the strategy: ""We really think we've priced it at the sweet spot,"" he said. ""It's all based on months of consumer research."" But complaints came thick and fast - in particular about data. The fact that customers upgrading from Orange or T-Mobile would pay £5 more for the same amount of data struck many as unreasonable. After all, the whole point of 4G was that lightning-fast speeds meant that you would want to consume far more data. Now EE is going some way to recognise that. Its entry price has been cut from £36 to £31 a month - though you still only get 500MB of data for that. (Incidentally, those who signed up at the original price won't be able to switch to the cheaper deal, which is bound to cause anger.) And it's bringing in a new £46 a month 20GB Sim-only deal designed for what it calls ""super-users"". EE says it has introduced this after ""listening to customers"" but still insists that only a tiny minority - less than 1% - of 4G users have shown a desire to have more than the current 8GB limit. But maybe it's a question of chicken and egg. If the initial prices had not been so high, more people would have signed up and chosen to use more data. That certainly seems to be the message in a report out today from Deloitte that warns mobile networks of an almost insatiable desire amongst smartphone users for data. When I asked EE whether the new price plans were a response to poor uptake of 4G, I was told the company could not disclose any numbers, but had been ""very pleased with the customer response to the launch of EE"". The rest of the mobile industry will be watching this move very closely. With Ofcom's 4G auction starting this month, operators will be wondering just how great the demand from customers is going to be and working out what that means as they bid for spectrum. Last autumn it looked as though EE had pulled off a coup by getting Ofcom to allow it to launch 4G before the rest of the industry. Now it seems the firm may have done its rivals a favour by running a live consumer experiment on their behalf.","Just three months after the launch of the UK's first 4G network, the ""Sale"" signs are going up at EE. The company has unveiled what it describes as ""new price plan offers"" to offer customers more choice. But what EE is actually doing is cutting prices in what looks like an admission that it got its initial offer wrong."
"By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter He has donated $3m (£2.4m) to the scheme, which is being piloted by the mayors of 16 US cities. He said it was ""one tool to close the wealth and income gap"". The idea of governments paying a basic income to citizens has gained momentum in response to the threat to jobs from artificial intelligence. The premise of universal basic income (UBI) is that every individual in a country will receive a cash payment at regular intervals, without any requirement to work or qualify for it. The payment would be given to every citizen, regardless of wealth or employment status. The US scheme, dubbed Mayors for a Guaranteed Income, is a version of this which would offer a recurring payment, but only to ""some"" residents. On its website, it is not made explicit who will receive payments but it talks of the need to address poverty, particularly in the light of the coronavirus pandemic. ""Covid-19 has only further exposed the economic fragility of most American households and has disproportionately impacted black and brown people,"" it says. ""Mayors will come together in this network to advocate for a guaranteed income - direct, reccuring cash payments - that lifts all of our communities, building a resilient, just America."" There are no firm proposals for how money would be allocated, or for how long the scheme would last. Mr Dorsey tweeted: ""This is one tool to close the wealth and income gap, level systemic race and gender inequalities and create economic security for families"". The project was founded by Stockton mayor Michael Tubbs, who wants it to become a national programme that will extend beyond the current pandemic. He has previously said that raising taxes of individuals such as Mr Dorsey could be one way to fund it. The 29-year-old is attempting to reinvent the Californian city he grew up in and has been experimenting with the idea of a universal income since 2018, paying $500 a month to 125 residents. Joblessness threat Talk of a universal basic income has been around for decades but has become closely associated with the idea of artificial intelligence - the argument being that as robots take over more jobs in society, humans will need a guaranteed annual income supplied by government. But Martin Luther King also suggested the idea in his 1967 book Where Do We Go From Here? AI expert Calum Chace said that a universal basic income could be some way off. ""It is seen by many as a solution to the threat of joblessness as machines automate more and more of our jobs in the coming years and decades,"" he said. ""Unfortunately, it is wholly unaffordable if it offers anything more than abject poverty. ""But if, say, [in] a generation from now machines do take most of our jobs, we should all be able to live the lives of leisure that economists like Maynard Keynes promised long ago - if, that is, we can achieve the economy of abundance, where the cost of a very good standard of living falls close to zero. ""The idea of fully automated luxury capitalism is the next big thing, once people understand the limitations of UBI.""","Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey has become the first investor in a radical plan to give people a basic income, regardless of job status."
"By Zoe KleinmanTechnology reporter, BBC News Respawn Entertainment said it intended to be ""secretive"" about its plans to combat cheating, so as not to forewarn players trying to break the rules. Apex Legends has attracted 50 million players since its release last month. It is often compared with Fortnite, which has 200 million players and was released in July 2017. Both shooter games are in the form of Battle Royale - where players fight against each other until only one survives. In Apex Legends, gamers play in three-player squads rather than as individuals. They pick from one of eight possible pre-defined characters, each with different abilities and roles. Apex Legends also has more realistic graphics than the cartoon-style feel of Fortnite. Legends draws heavily on work that Respawn did on the Titanfall 2 video game. In an update on Reddit, Respawn said it would be adding a report feature which would take players through to anti-cheat platform Easy Anti-Cheat. ""The service works but the fight against cheaters is an ongoing war that we'll need to continue to adapt to and be very vigilant about fighting,"" it said. ""We take cheating very seriously and care deeply about the health of Apex Legends for all players."" Games analyst Piers Harding-Rolls from IHS Markit told the BBC that cheating on the Windows PC version is more common because it is easier to download a cheat application. ""Reducing cheating is an ongoing process for games publishers and a significant operating cost,"" he said. ""The battle is never won, as new cheats and hacks are appearing all the time. ""Big publishers or developers like Respawn create teams of anti-cheating staff to target cheaters and also work with specialist companies to apply anti-cheating software which is integrated into their client software.""","The 355,000 players caught cheating on Apex Legends were all using the PC version of the game, the studio behind the game has said."
