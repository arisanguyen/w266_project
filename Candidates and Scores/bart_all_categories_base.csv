One surgeon said Wales should eventually lower the threshold at which people qualify for NHS-funded surgery, as recommended by a health watchdog. In Wales the threshold is set for patients with a BMI, or body mass index, of 50. Patients must also have either severe and uncontrolled high blood pressure, sleep apnoea or diabetes. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (Nice) says the NHS in Wales and England and Wales should offer so-called bariatric surgery, such as gastric sleeves and bypasses, to people with a mass index of 40. It also recommends surgery for people without a BMI of 35 if they have other health problems, suchas diabetes or high bloodpressure. An independent committee that plans specialist treatments for the NHS and Wales is reviewing the policy. The Welsh Health Specialised Services Committee is expected to deliver its findings to Health Minister Lesley Griffiths by the end of the month.
